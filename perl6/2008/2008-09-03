[00:09] <ruoso> TimToady, I really didn't get what you mean...

[00:09] *** Khisanth joined
[00:11] <TimToady> map {...}, $x never treats $x like an iterator

[00:12] <TimToady> map {...}, |$x is needed if $x contains an iterable object

[00:13] <TimToady> map {...}, @x is non-destructive because @x constructs a new iterator to put in the list

[00:13] <TimToady> map {...}, =$fh is destructive because $fh just returns itself as its iterator

[00:13] <ruoso> TimToady, so I get back to my question... what is the API to traverse the array without forcing eager evaluation...

[00:14] <ruoso> because even if we think on map as an operator... it still needs to be represented in terms of method calls to the input object

[00:14] <TimToady> an @a in list context returns a special iterator that the list can use, and how that works is between the array and the iterator

[00:15] <ruoso> right...

[00:15] <ruoso> but what's the api to access that?

[00:16] <ruoso> and also... what happens in "map { ... }, $x" when $x is an array object?

[00:16] <TimToady> internally when you need the next value from the list, it either returns the next real value or the prefix:<=> of its first "spec" iterator

[00:16] <TimToady> but "spec" iterators are hidden

[00:17] <TimToady> nothing happens to $x; its value is poked straight into the list of real values, not specs

[00:17] <ruoso> I mean... is $x treated as a list? or is it passed as the only value into a single iteration of map?

[00:17] <TimToady> $x is always just itself in list context

[00:18] <TimToady> scalar variables are never treated as composite objects unless you do something to indicate you want that

[00:18] <TimToady> merely putting $x into a list is not enough to indicate that

[00:18] <ruoso> ok... so that's determined by syntax...

[00:18] <TimToady> @$x or |$x

[00:18] <lambdabot> Maybe you meant: . ? @ bf ft id pl rc thx v wn

[00:18] <TimToady> it's one of the reasons we still have sigils

[00:18] <ruoso> right...

[00:19] * ruoso trying to put his ideas together...

[00:19] <TimToady> many objects can be used either in the singular or the plural, and we make that explicit

[00:20] *** xinming_ is now known as xinming

[00:21] <TimToady> likewise, (1,2,3) is a plural view of the list, while [1,2,3] is a singular view

[00:21] <ruoso> Ok... that solves the part that is "visible"...

[00:22] <TimToady> which is why plural (1,2,3) turns into singular [1,2,3] in item context

[00:22] *** bacek joined
[00:23] <TimToady> (arguably, confusing mutability)

[00:26] <ruoso> TimToady, when map needs the next value, what does it mean in terms of method calls on the array to "return the next real value"?

[00:26] <TimToady> map never sees the array.  the list has already asked the array for an iterator, and runs that iterator when map wants another value

[00:27] <ruoso> right... that's partly what I was thinking already

[00:27] <ruoso> but what "runs that iterator" mean in terms of method calls? .prefix:<=> ?

[00:28] <TimToady> probably

[00:28] <TimToady> don't see why not

[00:29] <TimToady> the point is that various languages either force you to track your own iterators, or have them implicitly floating around after "first call", and in Perl both of those approaches are considered a bit bogus

[00:29] <TimToady> the list data structure is the natural place for iterators to live once they are created

[00:31] *** alanhaggai joined
[00:31] <TimToady> so the list manages the iterator objects for you most of the time, and you don't have to manage them explicitly most of the time

[00:31] <ruoso> hmm...

[00:32] * ruoso trying to figure out what the means in the low level...

[00:32] <ruoso> ok... in the low-level there's no "implicit"...

[00:33] <ruoso> so, even if the syntax helps you so that "you don't have to manage them explicitly", the iterators are managed independently...

[00:34] <TimToady> if you call =$fh in scalar context, you're doing explicit iteration.  =$fh in list context merely installs $fh in the "todo" list of iterators

[00:34] <TimToady> note that you can't actually decide which till binding time

[00:35] <ruoso> because an "iterator in list context create a new lazy list"

[00:36] <TimToady> well, essentially an inner capture interpolates into an outer capture at that point, which is why list context flattens

[00:36] *** kanru joined
[00:36] <TimToady> slice context would keep the inner capture discreet

[00:37] <TimToady> discrete, rather

[00:37] *** bacek left
[00:38] *** bacek joined
[00:41] * ruoso trying to put the pieces together...

[00:51] <ruoso> TimToady, I think I found one confusing point... Is there an "Iterator" type? or is that just a way to access the list?

[00:58] <ruoso> the reason why that is relevant is because an iterator is not supposed to provide positional access... an iterator can only be consumed...

[01:00] <ruoso> that way, in "map {...}, map {...}, (1,2,3)", the left map receives just an iterator, and not a list...

[01:02] <ruoso> that fits well with the fact that an iterator in list context creates a lazy list...

[01:05] <ruoso> and also makes it clear that the return of the 'map' in the right has no obligation of providing positional access to the values...

[01:06] <ruoso> and we also can have a generic Lazy List implementation that receives an iterator object...

[01:06] *** Lichtkind_ joined
[01:10] <ruoso> map would then receive an iterator and return another iterator...

[01:15] <ruoso> TimToady, do you think that's sane?

[01:21] *** Lichtkind left
[01:25] * ruoso sleep &

[01:41] <TimToady> seems sane to me, as long as when you say (map {...}, 1,2,3)[$index] you're transforming the iterator to a list and treating the list as subscriptable or turning it into a subscriptable array maybe

[01:45] <TimToady> decommuting &

[06:38] <eternaleye_> Hi, I've been golfing around, and I figured a good way to test myself would be generating <a b c d> X <a b c d> in a way that was easily extensible to longer resulting strings than 2 characters. As is, I could chain on additional 'X <a b c d>'s,  but that felt inelegant. So, I tried using the [op] reduce operator, xx, and slice context to get what I wanted. I arrived at 'say $_ for [X] @@ <a b c d> xx 2 ;' but it didn't

[06:38] <eternaleye_> work, even with various attempts at using parentheses for scope. Any ideas?

[06:45] <moritz_> [X] doesn't amek sense for operators that return a list

[06:46] <moritz_> or does it?

[06:47] <moritz_> eternaleye_: maybe what you wrote is right, but pugs doesn't support slice context

[06:47] <moritz_> eternaleye_: so it won't work with pugs

[06:47] <moritz_> and other iimplementations don't do hyper ops

[06:47] <eternaleye_> X is a list infix operator, so shouldn't [X] @@( @foo @bar @baz ) do the same as [~] <mo os e> ?

[06:48] <eternaleye_> Ah, pugs not having slice context would do it

[06:48] <eternaleye_> Thanks!

[06:50] <moritz_> anyway, this looks evil ;)

[06:53] *** alc left
[06:57] <eternaleye_> Just think: for ( 1 .. 6 ) -> $foo { say $_ for [X] @@ <a b c d> xx $foo; } could be a reasonably effective password bruteforcing oneliner ;P

[06:58] <moritz_> omg ;)

[06:58] <eternaleye_> s/<a b c d>/[ a .. z, A .. Z, 0 .. 9 ]/

[09:21] <pim> hi, everybody.

[09:21] <masak> hi, pim

[09:22] <pim> why this doesn't work in perl 6 : my $n=7; if $n>3) {say "$n est bigger than 3"} ?

[09:22] <masak> pim: too many ')'? :)

[09:23] <pim> Yes but, that's just a mistake i have not in my real script.

[09:23] <pim> i do it again.

[09:23] <masak> perl6: my $n = 7; if $n > 3 { say "\$n is bigger than 3" }

[09:23] <p6eval> elf 22120: OUTPUT[\$n is bigger than 3␤]

[09:23] <p6eval> ..pugs, rakudo 30722: OUTPUT[$n is bigger than 3␤]

[09:23] <pim> my $n=7; if $n>3 {say "$n est bigger than 3"}

[09:23] <masak> pim: it works, see above.

[09:24] <masak> have you tried it with whitespace around the binary operators?

[09:24] <pim> YES.

[09:24] <masak> pim: well, as you see, it works here.

[09:24] <masak> what implementation of Perl 6 are you running?

[09:25] <masak> Pugs, Rakudo...?

[09:25] <masak> and what revision?

[09:26] <pim> Here are my two lines of my script:

[09:27] <pim>  [11:37] [pim(+i)] [2:#perl6(+Jnt 30,3)] [Act: 1]                                                                                                                                                                 

[09:27] <pim> [#perl6] 

[09:27] <pim> sorry

[09:27] <pim> I give you the values ...

[09:31] <masak> yes?

[09:31] <viklund> pim: it works for me if I put it in a script, but if I run it through -e 'code' it fails

[09:31] <pim> OK, i come to see the error comes from other part of my script: it's as melting pot script and when i put ONLY this test in it doesn't crash, so i must analyse more...

[09:32] <pim> probably precedent instruction...

[09:32] <masak> viklund: I get the same thing. care to send a rakudobug about this?

[09:33] <masak> viklund: hold on. no, it works.

[09:33] <masak> false alarm.

[09:33] <pim> I use two version of perl 6 perfectly isolated themselves.

[09:33] <masak> this works here: perl6 -e 'my $n = 7; if $n > 3 { say "$n is bigger than 3" }'

[09:34] <pim> the error is produced only for '>' test : not for '<'

[09:34] <masak> pim: could you nopaste the exact commands you're running?

[09:34] <pim> I have warnings complaints when starting my script about precedent instuctions.

[09:35] <moritz_> rakudo doesn't do any warnings yet

[09:35] <pim> Really sorry bur I don't know how to nopaste : can you explain to me?

[09:41] <masak> you're onto something here

[09:44] <masak> you've found a bug

[09:44] <masak> (I think)

[09:45] <pim> right : may i put this in my CV.

[09:46] <pim> This is Rakudo Perl 6, revision 30402 built on parrot 0.7.0-devel

[09:46] <pim> for i486-linux-gnu-thread-multi.

[09:47] <pim> This is parrot version.

[09:47] <pim> compiled by myself.

[09:47] <masak> oki

[09:47] <masak> and you have a sufficiently recent Rakudo, since I'm getting the same error

[09:49] *** bacek left
[09:49] *** cosimo left
[09:50] <masak> pim: smallest file that produces the error is this: 'loop () {\n}\nmy $n'

[12:20] <masak> I was just wondering about operator support for it

[12:21] <masak> ISTR there was someway one could inflict deep semantics on one of the operators using an adverb

[12:21] <masak> but maybe I dreamt that....

[12:23] <viklund> I can't find anything in S03, should be in there, but I only skimmed it

[16:45] <masak> it's checking that they are _not_ eqv

[16:45] <masak> whereas I think they should be

[16:46] <TimToady> I think there's some p5-think in that test

[16:46] <moritz_> ie the test is wrong?

[16:46] <masak> aye

[16:46] <TimToady> yes

[16:46] <TimToady> wait

[16:47] <TimToady> it's correct, I think

[16:47] <TimToady> does \@a serialize to something that includes, say, the variable name?

[16:48] <TimToady> or its location?

[16:48] <masak> ah

[16:48] *** Chillance joined
[16:48] <moritz_> pugs: my @a = (1, 2, 3); say (\@a).perl

[16:48] <p6eval> pugs: OUTPUT[\(1, 2, 3)␤]

[16:48] <TimToady> problem is that the value includes a notion of uniqueness

[16:49] <TimToady> if you serialize (\@a,\@b) and then deserialize, it has to turn into 2 distinct arrays

[16:49] <TimToady> and how does it know to do that?

[16:49] <moritz_> it does it automatically with pugs' output

[16:49] *** c9s joined
[16:49] <moritz_> pugs: my @a = (1, 2, 3); say (\@a, \@a).perl

[16:49] <p6eval> pugs: OUTPUT[(\(1, 2, 3), \(1, 2, 3))␤]

[16:49] <moritz_> whereas this is wrong

[16:50] <moritz_> because .[0] !=== .[1]

[16:51] <TimToady> it's the same problem as serializing a closure, really--you end up with the symbol tables coming along for the ride

[16:52] <moritz_> you can serialize it to something like do { my @a = (1, 2, 3); (\@a, \@a) };

[16:53] <moritz_> (which is roughly what Data::Dumper)

[16:53] <TimToady> but you still need to keep @a and @b distinct, so the test is correct

[16:54] <moritz_> :( yes

[16:57] <pugs_svn> r22124 | moritz++ | [t] moved var/var.t to spec/

[16:57] <TimToady> bbl &

[16:59] <masak> so, the conclusion is: (1) the test was correct, (2) I can still do what I want, comparing two different arrays, yes?

[16:59] <masak> (I got lost in the discussion, so I need to confirm)

[16:59] <pugs_svn> r22125 | moritz++ | [t] move var/is_readonly.t to spec

[18:06] <ruoso> pmurias, btw... after all the debate... "map" is again an operator instead of a method of Array...

[18:08] <moritz_> but only in the low level bootstrapping, right?

[18:08] <moritz_> I think the "special" thing should be for, not map

[18:08] <moritz_> and map can be implemented in terms of for

[18:09] <[particle]> map doesn't guarantee order

[18:09] <[particle]> for does, iirc

[18:09] <[particle]> so it seems for is better suited to be defined at a lower level

[18:09] <moritz_> then it's easier to implement map in terms of for than the other way round ;)

[18:10] <[particle]> yep

[18:10] *** Bzek left
[18:20] <ruoso> [particle], moritz_, "map" and "for" are actually synonyms...

[18:21] <ruoso> both are lazy... both return the values...

[18:21] <moritz_> and yet "for" appears in the grammar (because it has two terms in a row), and map doesn't

[18:21] <masak> ruoso: not in the sense that 'for' and 'foreach' are synonyms in Perl 5

[18:22] <masak> moritz_: right. that was my point as well, I think :)

[18:22] <moritz_> or to put it this way: map is part of the Prelude, for is part of the language itself

[18:22] <ruoso> masak, no... they're even more synonyms than that...

[18:22] <masak> even more? :)

[18:22] <masak> ruoso: what moritz_ said.

[18:22] <[particle]> hrmm, okay then

[18:23] <[particle]> now that you mention it, i remember that discussion

[18:24] <ruoso> for is only part of the language because it has no "," after the first parameter ...

[18:24] <ruoso> and I think map has it so it can be part of the prelude ;)

[18:30] *** mncharity joined
[18:33] <TimToady> map and for differ only syntactically, not semantically

[18:34] <mncharity> Hi all.  Been a while.  Any notable highlights from the last 3 weeks or so?

[18:34] <moritz_> mncharity: STD.pm now has symbol tables

[18:34] <TimToady> sorta

[18:35] <TimToady> only global

[18:35] <moritz_> mncharity: there's now a wiki engine written in Perl 6

[18:35] <TimToady> but it detects most bad sub calls

[18:35] <mncharity> neat

[18:36] <TimToady> dunno if you were out when identifiers changed to allow embedded apostrophes and hyphens

[18:36] <TimToady> but only if the next char is a letter

[18:36] <mncharity> !  that's a new one for me :)

[18:36] <moritz_> TimToady: STD.pm complains about (1|(2|3)) with "Right-associative any, | operator" - why is that forbidden?

[18:36] <TimToady> I did an experiment, and there were only two conflicts in the entire test suite

[18:37] <TimToady> and it makes Perl orthography more like English

[18:37] <mncharity> trailing ? and ! apropos ruby and scheme?

[18:37] <TimToady> no

[18:37] <TimToady> but it would be easy to add your own identifier rule

[18:37] <mncharity> indeed

[18:38] <mncharity> moritz_: re wiki engine, for what p6 dialect/implementation(s)?  rakudo?

[18:38] <TimToady> moritz_: dunno offhand, that error doesn't look familiar

[18:38] <masak> mncharity: yes, rakudo. currently.

[18:39] <mncharity> nifty

[18:39] <masak> we haven't tried Pugs yet

[18:39] <moritz_> TimToady: in t/spec/S03-junctions/associative.t if you feel like investigating

[18:39] <TimToady> mncharity: I don't know how much of the test suite was passing STD when you left, but it's 100% now, give or take quantum fluctuations

[18:40] <mncharity> awesome.

[18:40] <mncharity> anyone dumping and using the parses?

[18:40] <TimToady> nach nicht

[18:40] <mncharity> :)

[18:41] <moritz_> mncharity: me occasionally, for finding out WTF some constructs are supposed to mean

[18:41] <mncharity> lol

[18:41] <[particle]> are the parses approaching "correct"?

[18:41] <TimToady> adding symbol checking found much less damage than I expected

[18:41] <[particle]> or will that only be born out of implementation?

[18:41] <TimToady> though it found some

[18:42] <TimToady> so we're getting there, I think

[18:42] <moritz_> for example one test used |<< <a b c> (which I think is wrong anyway, but at least it parses)

[18:42] <TimToady> sounds like (1|(2|3)) isn't right though

[18:43] <TimToady> yeah, |<a b c> should have the same effect

[18:43] <moritz_> well, |<< would apply | to each item

[18:43] <moritz_> but items don't need to be "cheated" into captures anyway, right?

[18:43] <TimToady> |('a','b','c') is equiv to |'a', |'b', |'c' I think

[18:44] <TimToady> since items are degenerate lists

[18:44] <moritz_> ok

[18:44] <TimToady> yes, more to the point, |'a' is equivalent to 'a'

[18:45] <mncharity> how goes the test suite?

[18:45] <moritz_> we fixed errors that STD.pm caught

[18:45] *** abra joined
[18:45] <moritz_> and I'm moving stuff as much as I reasonably can

[18:46] <TimToady> bare (1|(2|3)) seems to parse fine, so maybe it's something else from earlier

[18:46] <moritz_> currently I'm blocking on understanding oo

[18:46] <mncharity> did the regex tests get updated?

[18:46] <moritz_> to review + move the oo/ tests

[18:46] <moritz_> mncharity: don't think so

[18:46] <mncharity> :/

[18:46] *** rindolf joined
[18:46] <moritz_> rakudo IO was too b0rked for Auzon to work with

[18:47] <moritz_> so the big chunk of regex tests don't run in rakudo

[18:47] <moritz_> he did write some tests for parsing the regexes though

[18:47] <TimToady> moritz_: t/spec/S03-junctions/associative.t is missing a comma

[18:47] <mncharity> ok.  ah well.

[18:48] <mncharity> oo tests++

[18:48] * moritz_ stupid

[18:48] <mncharity> I'd also like to understand oo.  Perhaps a seminar or reading group? :)

[18:49] <moritz_> it would very much help to meet in real life for that

[18:49] <mncharity> campfire...

[18:50] <TimToady> moritz_: it really ought to produce a "Two terms in a row error" somehow for that kind of error

[18:50] <TimToady> though to be fair to STD, the green/red coding did point right to the problem

[18:51] <moritz_> oh, I thought that the red part was the error message

[18:51] * moritz_ even dumper

[18:52] <TimToady> green/red are probably not the best colors for RG colorblindfolk though

[18:52] <pugs_svn> r22132 | moritz++ | [t/spec] added missing comma, TimToady++

[18:58] <mncharity> neat.  yeah, it's WHAT etal, desugaring and control flow, underlying oo primitives, initialization, alternate reps, runtime mutation, and... etc, which are on my own puzzle list.

[18:58] <mncharity> hi pmurias!  how goes?

[19:00] <mncharity> how goes the C runtime?

[19:00] *** rdice joined
[19:02] <mncharity> so, wrapping up... (appointment)  any other highlights?

[19:02] <pmurias> mncharity: you mean smop?

[19:02] <mncharity> yes

[19:02] <pmurias> it progresses steadily

[19:02] <TimToady> mncharity: on the performance front, STD now parses itself in <30 seconds if the lexer is pregenerated

[19:03] <mncharity> oh wow.  nifty.

[19:03] <TimToady> well, I'd like to squeeze another 10x out of it, but it's usable now

[19:04] <Juerd> TimToady: That was multiple minutes before?

[19:04] <TimToady> also need to shrink the lexer cache, which takes an unconscionable amount of disk at the moment :)

[19:04] <mncharity> 30 s down from... 4 min?

[19:04] <TimToady> I think was about 2 minutes before

[19:04] <TimToady> it's still 1.5 min if you have to rebuild the cache

[19:05] <pmurias> the cache is input independent?

[19:05] <TimToady> but that's only when the language changes, which is often :/

[19:05] <TimToady> well, it's idempotent, if not independent

[19:05] <TimToady> it only generates "digraphs" for sequences it has seen

[19:06] <TimToady> so any given parse may generate more of them

[19:06] <TimToady> but the whole digraph scheme is just a workaround

[19:06] <TimToady> to prevent the lexer from feed TRE patterns that are too long

[19:06] <TimToady> *feeding

[19:07] <TimToady> TRE tends to go quadratic in stack space on pattern size

[19:08] <TimToady> I say "digraphs", but it's more like "polygraphs" since it's variable length

[19:08] <TimToady> it uses more characters if it thinks a hyperoperator is coming

[19:08] <TimToady> metaoperator rather

[19:08] <TimToady> since those tend to generate large token lists

[19:10] <TimToady> at some point we'll write our own DFA matcher and throw out TRE plus all its workarounds, which should simplify _AUTOLEX*

[19:10] <pmurias> what's stoping you from switching from regex insanity to autmatons

[19:11] <mncharity> big picture...  has there been any, how to say it... craving for elf?  volunteers stopping by?  folks wishing elf did X?  Eg, used STD and generated fast CL?  Or... not so much?

[19:11] <TimToady> just tuits

[19:11] <[particle]> timtoady: do you have any language preference for the dfa matcher, or just performance requirements?

[19:11] <mncharity> or is elf development largely unmissed?

[19:12] <TimToady> I would like one in Perl 6, of course, that compiles down to something as fast as C :)

[19:12] <moritz_> mncharity: I'd love to have any implementation that relies on STD.pm. I don't care what it's called, as long as it's hackable

[19:12] <[particle]> well, i asked for it....

[19:13] <pmurias> mncharity: elf generating m0ld code would be very nice

[19:13] <moritz_> mncharity: elf doesn't even have a homepage that I can link to if I write about it, so it's hard to create demand from everybody but core p6 hackers (who ususally have a preferred implementation already)

[19:25] *** zamolxes left
[19:29] <pmurias> TimToady: it would have to be a TDFA matcher to replace TGE?

[19:30] <TimToady> it doesn't really need full tagging.  it needs two things that a standard dfa doesn't provide

[19:31] <TimToady> 1) the ability to know which alternative matched

[19:31] <TimToady> 2) the ability to back off to shorter matches

[19:31] <TimToady> on the other hand, it doesn't need "scanning", since tokens are always anchored

[19:33] <TimToady> and it's probably okay for a(b|c)d to be tree-ized into a(bd|cd)

[19:33] <TimToady> esp if it makes it easier to determine (1)

[19:34] <TimToady> or to implement (2), for that matter, since you have to know which alternative to back into

[19:37] <TimToady> if full tagging implies quadratic stack space theoritically, then I would say I *don't* want full tagging

[19:37] <TimToady> *theoretically

[19:37] *** masak left
[19:38] <TimToady> (I don't know offhand if that's true though)

[19:39] <TimToady> basically I see a lazily generated trie that knows about all the literal strings it has parsed so far, and which branches are implied by any particular traversal of the trie

[19:40] <TimToady> and knows when the trie runs out how to generate more from the current regex state vector

[19:41] <TimToady> so the second time you hit any particular literal string, you never even see the regexes

[19:42] * pmurias will need a fresher brain, and some time with pen & paper to process the above

[19:43] <TimToady> pmichaud is also going to be working on this, though perhaps in PIR

[19:43] <TimToady> so you might compare notes

[19:44] <ruoso> the biggest problem with that seems to be the space required to keep a clone state for each sub-token...
