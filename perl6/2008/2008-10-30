[17:52] <moritz_> azawawi: pong

[17:52] <azawawi> moritz_: i examined pod comment output from redspans and i dont think it will be useful

[17:53] <moritz_> azawawi: in what way? doesn't it identify pod as such?

[17:53] <azawawi> moritz_: nop... only '=cut' as pod, no starter token... like pod_start or something

[17:54] *** ZuLuuuuuu joined
[17:55] <moritz_> azawawi: ah, but you can walk up the parse tree, and see that it's matched by pod_comment somewhere

[17:56] <moritz_> azawawi: I have an experimental highlighting script here (based on redspans) that walks the parse tree until it finds a token name that it can handle

[17:56] <azawawi> moritz_: that's what i basically have here in STD_syntax_highlight --redspans 

[17:58] <moritz_> then what's wrong with it?

[17:59] <azawawi> moritz_: nothing... ;-)

[17:59] <moritz_> azawawi: ok ;)

[17:59] <azawawi> moritz_: i was only sharing ideas...

[17:59] <moritz_> ok ;)

[17:59] <TimToady> =cut is not pod  :)

[17:59] <lambdabot> TimToady: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[18:00] * ruoso just as a side note... it seems that merging SMOP and p5 together is a very viable idea... Coro::State already implements a great part of the job...

[18:01] <TimToady> okay, I'll expect it to be done by Monday  :)

[18:01] *** pbuetow joined
[18:01] <ruoso> :P

[18:02] <[particle]> he didn't say which monday

[18:03] <ruoso> heh

[18:03] <TimToady> moritz_: unrecognized =foo directives are considered standalone in p6

[18:03] <TimToady> and =cut currently falls into that category

[18:04] * moritz_ tested with =begin foo ... =end foo anyway

[18:05] <pugs_svn> r22830 | azawawi++ | [STD_syntax_highlight] #-comments support in --redspans

[18:07] <b_jonas> so perl6 isn't like p5 in that =cut is the only thing that can return the perl interpreter from pod to perl

[18:08] <TimToady> correct, =end returns to previous parse state, and standalone directives act like their own =begin/=end

[18:09] <b_jonas> I hope there'll be a negated =begin

[18:09] <azawawi> TimToady: what does vws and unv stand for?

[18:09] <b_jonas> that's what I'm most missing from p5od

[18:09] <moritz_> vws = vertical whitespace

[18:09] <b_jonas> because with =begin you can embed any special formatting to a pod

[18:09] <moritz_> b_jonas: what do you mean by "negated begin"? "don't begin here?"

[18:09] <[particle]> negated =begin? you mean =end?

[18:09] <b_jonas> but I still want a default

[18:09] <b_jonas> no, not =end

[18:10] <azawawi> sample redspans output: http://feather.perl6.nl/~azawawi/test.pl.txt

[18:10] <b_jonas> where =begin foo means to speak only to the pod2foo converter, =begin !foo (or some other syntax) should speak a default pod to any pod converter other than pod2foo

[18:11] <b_jonas> so your pod can be viewed by any pos converter even if it displays some features better in foo

[18:11] <azawawi> moritz_: take a look at the link i sent earlier plz; check out =begin and =cut

[18:12] <TimToady> unv = "un-vertical whitespace"

[18:12] <moritz_> b_jonas: how could you ever know that all but one POD converter can handle a special markup (or, whatever)

[18:12] <azawawi> ;-)

[18:12] <TimToady> azawawi: also looks like redspans is putting out ''' for single quotes, which looks bad

[18:13] <b_jonas> moritz_: no, that part would have ordinary markup as a fallback

[18:13] <b_jonas> eg. you'd have like

[18:13] <b_jonas> =begin html foo <font color="red">bar</font> qux =end =begin !html foo B<bar> qux =end

[18:14] <TimToady> the current language of pod markup is controlled by modules usage, just as p6 itself is

[18:14] <b_jonas> TimToady: yes, =begin foo can be controlled by that, but =begin !foo needs to be standardized

[18:14] <b_jonas> so that if a converter does not know "foo" it would include the part in =begin !foo but not include the part in =begin foo

[18:15] <b_jonas> that is, this is an incompatible change you can't add to p5od for all the existing converters would be wrong

[18:15] <TimToady> that may be something TheDamian is going to propose

[18:15] <TimToady> he's got another proposal in the works

[18:15] <b_jonas> I don't care about the exact syntax for it

[18:16] <TimToady> anyway, STD doesn't pretend to parse real pod yet

[18:16] <pugs_svn> r22831 | ruoso++ | [smop_highlight] outputs redspans-html by default, since it recognizes POD correctly

[18:16] <b_jonas> STD is special, it doesn't need to know about this

[18:16] <TimToady> esp since we don't know what real pod is yet...

[18:16] <b_jonas> for it should ignore both =begin foo and =begin !foo

[18:16] <b_jonas> neither of them contain code

[18:16] <TimToady> STD will need to know real pod

[18:17] <TimToady> or it can't supply %=DATA and such

[18:17] <b_jonas> that's a pity actually: a change only the perl interpreter needs to know about is easier to implement than one _all_ the pod2foo converters need to know about

[18:18] <ruoso> er... it's seeing indentation white spaces as comment for some reason...

[18:19] <TimToady> well, indentation is merely a form of commentary in p6 :P

[18:19] <TimToady> b_jonas: it's called STD for a reason

[18:19] <b_jonas> I mean, even if I wrote a patch for all pod2foo converters, I couldn't release modules with =begin !foo in their pod because whoever isntalls it might not have installed new versions of the pod

[18:20] <ruoso> TimToady, the only problem is weird people like me who like comments with a different background-color than the rest of the code.../

[18:20] <TimToady> which they will discover as soon as they hit the =use B_Jonas_Module

[18:21] <azawawi> moritz_: so i should find =cut <pod_comment> and move backwards until i see what =ident?

[18:21] <b_jonas> maybe I should write the patches to all pod2foo now (how many are there? five? fifty?) and to the perldoc perlpod, and then after like eight years when no-one uses perl 5.10.0 anymore I'll be able to use it

[18:21] <moritz_> azawawi: dunno, I'm out of sync right now... :/

[18:22] <TimToady> azawawi: if you find =cut, you should halt and catch fire

[18:22] <azawawi> TimToady: ;-) please take a look at http://feather.perl6.nl/~azawawi/test.pl.txt

[18:23] <TimToady> parrot even has a HCF instruction for that...

[18:24] <moritz_> "token on fire, please extinguish before I'll try to backtrack"

[18:24] <TimToady> azawawi: what do you want me to see?

[18:24] <azawawi> TimToady: =begin

[18:25] <b_jonas> is that what !!! calls?

[18:38] <szabgab> so how do you generate thos htmls?

[18:39] <moritz_> szabgab: there's STD_syntax_highlight in src/perl6/ in the pugs repo

[18:39] <azawawi> szabgab: cd pugs/src/perl6; perldoc STD_syntax_highlight

[18:39] <moritz_> szabgab: that runs STD.pm to generate a parse tree

[18:39] <moritz_> for running STD.pm you need perl5.10.0, re::engine::TRE, Moose and JSON::XS

[18:41] <szabgab> thanks, I'll take a look at that later

[18:50] <szabgab> or is it too late for me ?

[20:24] <spx2> so I can become a hero by implementing in perl6 functionality already existing in perl5 ?

[20:24] <spx2> :D

[20:25] <PerlJam> ruoso: sounds like a lot of work.  Also sounds like it'll make p5 even slower.  (these are just my initial reactions)

[20:26] <ruoso> in optimizers I trust ;)

[22:14] <pmurias> PerlJam: do you think anything from ruoso's list is particulary hard? or does it seems a lot of work as it consists of multiple steps?

[22:14] <lambdabot> pmurias: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.
