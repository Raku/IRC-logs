[15:52] <masak> I'm just testing what happens with .=

[15:53] <masak> it's now [#perl #60778] :)

[15:53] <jnthn> It should give an error.

[15:54] <jnthn> It looks like it's trying to give a meaningful one by calling panic...apart from for some reason that doesn't work out. :-S

[15:54] <masak> aye.

[15:55] <masak> well, that's what I'm here for, pointing out when strange things happen in Rakudo :)
