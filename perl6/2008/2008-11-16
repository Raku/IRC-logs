[02:16] <pmichaud> slavik: <blah>?  means that any captured value goes into an array, yes.

[02:26] <slavik> pmichaud: right, but if I do <blah> then $/<blah> will hold it, not $/<blah>[0] like it is with <blah>?

[02:26] <slavik> IMO, since <blah> is said to be optional with '?' why should it go into an array?

[02:27] <pmichaud> that's what the spec says

[02:27] <slavik> also, I am having trouble with assertions ...

[02:27] <slavik> I see

[02:27] <pmichaud> but it's really that  <blah>?   is the same as    <blah> ** 0..1

[02:27] <pmichaud> i.e., it's a quantifier, and all quantified captures become an array

[02:27] <slavik> ahh, I see, makes sense now

[02:28] <slavik> 	token port { (\d ** 1..5) <?{1 <= $0 < 2**16}> }

[02:28] <slavik> does that make sense?

[02:30] <slavik> rakudo tells me that the line is not terminated properly

[02:30] <slavik> rakudo: token port { (\d ** 1..5) <?{1 <= $0 < 2**16}> }

[02:30] <p6eval> rakudo 32683: OUTPUT[Statement not terminated properly at line 1, near "?{1 <= $0 "␤␤current instr.: 'parrot;PGE;Util;die' pc 129 (runtime/parrot/library/PGE/Util.pir:83)␤]

[02:31] <slavik> also, I forget how to put a character into a token that should not be captured ...

[02:31] <slavik> <.':'> ???

[02:35] <slavik> so then * and + become ** 0..inf and ** 1..inf respectively?

[13:25] <pernod> Hi

[13:25] <pernod> Has anyone got time for a question regarding building pugs from the public svn repository?

[13:26] <slavik> I used the cabal system

[13:26] <lambdabot> slavik: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[13:26] <slavik> @messages

[13:26] <pernod> ok

[13:26] <lambdabot> pmichaud said 7h 40m 34s ago: code assertions aren't implemented in rakudo yet.

[13:26] <masak> pernod: I also used Cabal. you tried that?

[13:26] <pernod> So the plain svn $repository;perl Makefile.pl;make is not the way to go?

[13:26] <pernod> Nope.

[13:26] <pernod> I'l have a look at cabal then.

[13:26] *** wknight8111 joined
[13:27] <pernod> It's just that I get an error from svn when I attempt to fetch the repository

[13:27] <pernod> A    pugs/v6/smop/m0ld/m0ld.cabal

[13:27] <masak> pernod: I don't know if making from svn works again. it used to not work, at least.

[13:27] <pernod> I saw something on the pugsblog that it should be working, but it was two months ago ...

[13:27] <masak> pernod: is that on a fresh checkout?

[13:28] <pernod> Yup

[13:28] <masak> or are you updating?

[13:28] <masak> strange...

[13:28] <pernod> Indeed!

[13:28] <pernod> Things didn't work, so I thought I'd try a fresh checkout.

[13:28] <lambdabot> Title: pugs - Revision 23028: /

[13:28] <masak> I'm stumped. maybe the smop devs pmurias and ruoso know what's going on.

[13:29] <pernod> ok

[13:31] <pmurias> pernod: that's definitely a svn bug

[13:31] <pernod> Ok.

[13:31] <pernod> I just used the default command line svn in Mac OS X.

[13:31] <pernod> I'll see if updating svn helps.

[13:31] <pernod> Thanks!

[13:34] <pmurias> pernod: usually svn screws up the .svn dir and prints stupid error messages, but a problem with a fresh checkout is strange

[13:34] <masak> and concerning.

[14:19] <pmurias> pernod: you shouldn't thank me just yet my suggestions are most likely bogus

[14:19] <pmurias> ;)

[14:20] <pernod> pmurias: shotgun debugging for the win!

[14:21] <slavik> my suggestion is to dump OSX and use a real OS :P

[14:24] <masak> oh come on -- OS bashing is so 2002. we bash each other's web browsers nowadays.

[14:25] <masak> or virtual machines.

[14:27] <pernod> I like my shiny toy :D

[14:27] <masak> yes, we like that word here on #perl6 :)

[14:28] <pernod> Good stuff.

[14:28] * pernod is waiting for svn-1.5.4 to build from source

[14:30] * lizsac is waiting for service pack 2 to install

[14:31] <pmurias> pernod: re "shotgun debugging" - did it work? 

[14:32] <pernod> pmurias: I'm still waiting for my subversion client to be up to date.

[14:32] <ruoso> pmurias, Perl 6 code uses FETCH all over the way... including while building the object...

[14:32] <pmurias> ruoso: hi

[14:32] <ruoso> pmurias, hi

[14:33] <pernod> The default svn on os x is 1.4.4, so I thought I'd get the latest subversion before anything else. 

[14:33] <pmurias> ruoso: if we make sure the object is always in a container it should work

[14:34] <ruoso> pmurias, it ends up being by itself at some point...

[14:34] <ruoso> I think intercepting FETCH calls in p6opaque might be sane

[14:35] <ruoso> we just need to find a way to discover when to intercept and when not to intercept

[14:35] <pmurias> which is where the insanity creeps in

[14:36] <ruoso> maybe we simply have a switch

[14:36] <ruoso> and it by defaults intercepts the FETCH

[14:36] <pmurias> ruoso: have you seen my latest change having is rw instead of is copy as the default?

[14:36] <ruoso> it doesn't solve the problem

[14:37] <ruoso> because it ends up being by itself at some other point

[14:37] <pmurias> not nessesarly

[14:37] <ruoso> well, I tried that path, and it always got there at some point

[14:37] <pmurias> if we put it in a scalar using VAR($foo).STORE(...)

[14:38] <ruoso> pmurias, I have to leave now (lunch), and might not get back today, so feel free to try that

[14:39] <ruoso> but I should warn that I don't see a very near exit...

[14:48] <masak> pernod: so is Rakudo.

[14:48] <masak> in some cases, even more so.

[20:38] <masak> rindolf: the README in that directory should get you started

[20:38] <masak> slavik: that's what STD does.

[20:38] <slavik> oh, ok

[20:39] <masak> welcome to the future :)

[20:39] <slavik> :)

[20:42] <rindolf> https://svn.pugscode.org is donw

[20:42] <lambdabot> Title: pugs - Revision 23028: /

[20:42] <masak> rindolf: apparently not :)

[20:43] <masak> rindolf: (try it without the s in https)

[20:44] <rindolf> masak: ah.

[21:06] <masak> that should work, right?

[21:07] <slavik> masak: why the pointy block?

[21:07] <masak> slavik: good question.

[21:07] <masak> it's not really needed.

[21:07] <slavik> rakudo: say $/ if "foo" ~~ /foo/;

[21:07] <p6eval> rakudo 32732: OUTPUT[foo␤]

[21:07] <slavik> :)

[21:07] <masak> aye :)

[21:07] <masak> simpler.

[21:08] <slavik> and I don't think pointy blocks work for if ... do they?

[21:08] <masak> slavik: they do.

[21:08] <masak> so my question still remains. that should work, right?

[21:08] <slavik> hmm

[21:08] <slavik> no idea

[21:08] <masak> anyone with an idea?

[21:09] <masak> can closure parameters be called $/ ?

[21:09] <slavik> rakudo: if "foo" ~~ /foo/ -> $a { say $a; }

[21:09] <p6eval> rakudo 32732: OUTPUT[foo␤]

[21:10] <masak> why discriminate $/ ?

[21:10] <slavik> hmm, it's a special var?

[21:11] <masak> yes, you could say that.

[21:12] <bacek> pugs: my @a=(1,2); my @b=(1,2); say @a === @b;

[21:17] <masak> might I suggest that we add a warning for when a non-sideeffect method in the Prelude is used in void context? like .subst, for example. might catch a few embarrassing errors, like the one I just did.

[21:17] <masak> s/did/made/

[21:19] <slavik> stas: no idea ... try removing rw

[21:20] <slavik> and read the spec

[21:20] *** stas left
[21:21] <masak> guess he went to read the spec.

[21:21] <slavik> is rw is kind of ambiguous ...

[21:21] <masak> slavik: how so?

[21:22] <slavik> well, "is rw" is that inheritance or attributes?

[21:22] <slavik> or do classes HAVE to start with a capital letter?

[21:22] <masak> neither.

[21:22] <masak> it's a trait

[21:22] <masak> slavik: no, why would they?

[21:22] * slavik meant trait by the work attributes

[21:23] <slavik> so, how do you distinguish between the two

[21:23] <masak> slavik: the member variables are called attributes in Perl 6.

[21:23] <slavik> err?

[21:23] <masak> slavik: class inheritance is only done when declaring the class.

[21:23] <masak> there's no ambiguity.

[21:23] <slavik> right

[21:24] <slavik> look at the code

[21:24] * masak looks

[21:24] <slavik> it says "class Point is rw { .............. }"

[21:24] <masak> ah.

[21:24] <slavik> and rakudo thinks that rw is a class, not an attribute type thing

[21:24] <masak> well, as long as there's a class called 'rw', then it's no problem :)

[21:25] <slavik> so that is indeed not the intended syntax

[21:25] <slavik> the traits have to be rw, correct?

[21:25] <masak> depends on what was intended.

[21:25] <masak> slavik: what do you mean, have to?

[21:26] <slavik> ie: class Point { has $.x is rw; }

[21:26] <masak> you can have a trait which is not called 'rw'.

[21:26] <masak> slavik: that's legal, but omitting the 'rw' trait is legal, too.

[21:26] *** rindolf left
[21:27] <slavik> masak: but the point class there, the idea behind the code is to declare it as a C struct (complete read write on everything)

[21:27] <masak> slavik: (note: 'is rw' is called a trait, '$.x' is called an attribute in Perl 6)

[21:27] <slavik> right

[21:27] <masak> slavik: if that's what was intended, that is indeed not the intended syntax.

[21:27] <slavik> masak: exactly

[21:28] <masak> rakudo: my $a = " foo "; $a .= subst( / ^ \s+ /, '' )

[21:28] <p6eval> rakudo 32733: RESULT["foo "]

[21:28] <slavik> ok, I am off

[21:28] <masak> slavik: see you.

[21:29] <slavik> .= ???

[21:29] <slavik> oh, nvm

[21:29] <masak> slavik: read the spec. :)

[21:29] <slavik> ha! neat!

[21:29] <masak> the above code throws a 'no applicable methods' on my box

[21:29] <masak> maybe I need to do a clean checkout.

[21:30] <slavik> rakudo: say "25" + 5

[21:30] <p6eval> rakudo 32733: OUTPUT[30␤]

[21:30] <slavik> rakudo: say "helloworld25" + 5

[21:30] <p6eval> rakudo 32733: OUTPUT[5␤]

[21:30] <masak> still the same old Perl.

[21:31] <slavik> yeah

[21:31] <slavik> rakudo: say "helloworld25" ~ 5

[21:31] <p6eval> rakudo 32733: OUTPUT[helloworld255␤]

[21:31] <masak> rakudo: my $file = 'picture238.jpg'; $file++; say $file

[21:31] <p6eval> rakudo 32733: OUTPUT[picture239.jpg␤]

[21:31] <masak> :)

[21:31] *** slavik left
[21:32] <masak> oh, and that last one by slavik++ is a bug too, right? :)

[21:32] <masak> oh, nvm

[21:32] *** kisu_ joined
[21:37] *** kisu left
[21:40] <masak> dang! I still get 'no applicable methods', even after doing a clean checkout.

[21:41] <masak> could someone else test this locally on r32733?

[21:45] <masak> ok, nvm. false alarm :/
