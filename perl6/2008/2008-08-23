[10:01] <moritz_> masak: should I apply it? (the one from the git repo)

[10:01] <lambdabot> moritz_: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[10:01] <masak> moritz_: please do. the latest one, named _oops

[10:02] <masak> oh, the one from the git repo? yes, that's the same one.

[10:03] <moritz_> are there any tests for subst? or do you have some locally?

[10:03] <masak> not that I know of, and no :/

[10:03] <masak> hm, wait

[10:04] <masak> yes, I curated the subst tests a while back

[10:04] <masak> so they exist

[10:04] <masak> probably even in t/spec/

[10:05] <masak> ah, no, it's in t/builtins/strings/subst.t

[10:05] <moritz_> masak: and stuff like %hash.delete('item'), that's probably easier to implement than to work around ;)

[10:06] <masak> moritz_: aye, but not when you're working towards getting something to work

[10:06] * moritz_ tries to implement it

[10:06] <masak> moritz_++

[10:08] <rakudo_svn> r30467 | moritz++ | [rakudo] implement Str.subst, masak++. Closes RT #57756 

[10:08] <rakudo_svn> r30467 | moritz++ | Patch Courtesy by Carl Mas?\195?\164k <cmasak at gmail dot com>

[10:08] <moritz_> oh, sorry

[10:08] <moritz_> got your name wrong :(

[10:09] <masak> yes, s/asä/äsa/ # :)

[10:09] <masak> it's an Estonian name, allegedly meaning "honey harvest"

[10:10] <masak> is there a source for the quote "Because once Perl 6 is released, every day will feel like Christmas"? I remember first seeing it in one of audreyt's talk slides.

[10:10] <rakudo_svn> r30468 | moritz++ | [rakudo] implement Hash.delete

[10:11] <moritz_> nice name

[10:11] <masak> moritz_++ # wow, that _was_ quick!

[10:11] <moritz_> my last name means "spring" (the season)

[10:11] <masak> ah, right

[10:11] <moritz_> it only implements deletion of one item, not slices

[10:11] * masak knows embarassingly little German

[10:12] * moritz_ knows embarassingly little Estonian ;)

[10:13] <masak> well, that goes for me too :)

[10:13] <moritz_> how is it pronounced? (your name, I mean)

[10:13] <moritz_> I should probably just listen to your talk again.. ;)

[10:14] <masak> moritz_: stress on the first syllable, first vowel pronounced as the one in "bear"

[10:14] <masak> moritz_: it's online? where? :)

[10:14] <moritz_> yapc.tv

[10:15] <masak> someone++

[10:15] <moritz_> you need to subscribe to the use.perl.org newsfeed ;)

[10:16] <masak> apparently :)

[10:16] <masak> actually, I probably am, but I'm way behind on my feeds

[10:18] <moritz_> when I'm too much behind on feeds I just mark them all as read ;)

[10:19] <pugs_svn> r22021 | moritz++ | [t] move subst.t to spec/, changed fudging a bit and added smartlink

[10:20] <moritz_> aparently rakudo still hs problems catching some parse or compile time errors in eval()

[10:21] <gaal> I think it may have been putter who said that (every day == Christmas). Or maybe spinclad?

[10:24] <masak> gaal: thank you. I'll do some searching on irc.pugscode.org

[10:24] <moritz_> (sadly the search is partially broken, and I have no energy/fun/motivation to investigate)

[10:25] <moritz_> I should really rewrite the search to use KinoSearch

[10:26] <masak> moritz_: indeed. it finds nothing on 'christmas'

[10:26] <masak> ...which is frankly impossible :)

[10:27] <masak> oops, that was an SVN search I just made.

[10:28] <masak> yup, t'was spinclad who said it, on 2007-11-16

[10:28] <masak> but I doubt that's the first time

[10:29] <masak> oh well, I'll attribute the quote to him, and then change it as I learn more

[10:38] <moritz_> just ask p6l

[10:38] <masak> oki

[10:39] <moritz_> but if I remember the tests corectly they are frankly impossible

[10:39] <moritz_> because the arguments to subst are evaluated before the match

[10:40] <masak> needs some mulling over, in other words

[10:40] <masak> I got bitten by the behaviour yesterday, so I hope that the current semantics are unintended/to-be-replaced

[11:25] <Ehtyar> anyone know a place to get pugs/parrot for windows that was built more recently than a year ago?

[11:28] <pugs_svn> r22022 | moritz++ | [t/spec] start to fudge delete.t for rakudo

[11:32] <pugs_svn> r22023 | moritz++ | [t/spec] fudged S29-hash/delete.t for rakudo. Removed deprecated 'delete as a

[11:32] <pugs_svn> r22023 | moritz++ | sub' construct.

[11:35] <Alias_> Ehtyar: I'm not sure there is anywhere, although I've started work on moving parrot into the same build system we use for Strawberry Perl

[11:36] <Ehtyar> meaning strawberry will come with parrot soon?

[11:36] <moritz_> Ehtyar: there's a cygwin parrot built, if that helps you

[11:37] <moritz_> and there's http://sourceforge.net/projects/parrotwin32

[11:37] <Ehtyar> well i have absolutely no idea how i missed that...

[11:37] <Ehtyar> thank you

[11:38] <Ehtyar> when perl 6 is final, will it be implemented in c/c++ or is perl 6 going to be run from parrot?

[11:38] <moritz_> the goal is to implement Perl 6 in Perl 6

[11:38] <moritz_> and for one of those projects parrot will be the runtime

[11:39] <Ehtyar> i guess that's why i didn't already know the answer :P

[11:41] <Ehtyar> i can't believe i missed parrotwin32

[11:41] <Ehtyar> i've been searching for a half hour...

[11:43] <moritz_> first google hit for "parrot win32" ;)

[11:43] <moritz_> but I had the advantage that I knew it exists ;)

[11:43] <Ehtyar> i was using "windows"

[11:44] <Ehtyar> nowhere to be seen in a search for "parrot windows"

[11:44] <moritz_> that should be changed somehow

[11:46] <Ehtyar> well in all fairness i should have tried win32

[11:46] <Ehtyar> not used to search for cross platform projects anymore apparently

[11:46] <Ehtyar> searching*
