[20:02] <mncharity> more near term, I'm hoping to do a new IR in the next day or two, plus some other bits, and then point out you can write something like http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/misc/elf/elf_c_src/EmitSimpleP5_fromIR0.pm and http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/misc/elf/elf_c_src/ElfC.pm and then just say  ../..../elf_d -x -o myownp6 MyOwnCompiler.pm .

[20:02] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/2t6a88

[20:03] <cj> pmurias: nice

[20:03] *** ruoso joined
[20:05] <mncharity> where MyOwnCompiler.pm is of course welcome to look just like ElfC.pm but for whichever modules you wish to swap out.  it could also be nice to have   class MyEmitter is TheElfDEmitter { ... just a few changes if you like ... }, but we'll see.

[20:05] <cj> mncharity: yes, yes, yes.

[20:05] <mncharity> :)

[20:05] <cj> does MyOwnCompiler.pm inherit from SomeGenericCompiler.pm?

[20:08] <mncharity> at the moment, well, ElfC.pm doesn't do anything.  it's a list of use()s.  but the very short-term intent is for ElfC.pm to merely be a convenience hack.  "you've asked for whole program compilation of ElfC.pm, and I see it use()s these other modules, so I'll compile them too".  advantage over "here is a list of files" is that the modules are free themselves to use(),

[20:08] <cj> mncharity: why doesn't the kp6 guy ever hang out here?

[20:09] <pmurias> cj: fglock?

[20:09] <cj> yes, him

[20:09] <mncharity> and thus refactor without impacting users, and it permits using -I to override modules.  eh, it's a hack.  but seemed pretty, perhaps convenient, and not entirely unprincipled.

[20:11] <mncharity> re fglock, no idea.

[20:13] <mncharity> though for myself, I've followed a "work on some p6 thing intensively for a while, which becomes increasingly unattractive as it bogs down or fails to attract interest, or the apparent need for it goes away, or life demands more attention, and so I'm not around much" pattern over the years.

[20:15] <cj> yes... I have that problem, too... but I don't realize when life is trying to get my attention and end up losing out on that instead.  oops.

[20:16] <pmurias> perl elf_c -e 'say 3'

[20:16] <pmurias> Can't call method "elems" on unblessed reference at elf_c line 1756.

[20:17] <pmurias> mncharity: will the "DSLs" stay in higher elf version or will the be replace by higher forms of (meta)programming?

[20:50] <mncharity> re oops, lol.  oh yeah.

[20:51] <mncharity> pmurias: sorry, I was off having an elf conversation in #parrot.   re elf_c, checking...

[20:52] *** rafl left
[20:52] *** rafl joined
[20:54] <mncharity> perl elf_c -e 'say 3'  gives me 3 for both 5.8.8 and 5.10.0 .  with elf_c from r20201.  Though 5.10 decorates it with "v-string in use/require non-portable at /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.10.0/autobox/Core.pm line 16.". :/

[20:54] *** wtgee left
[20:54] <mncharity> pmurias: do you have the current version of autoload, autoload::Core?

[20:55] <mncharity> elems is coming from autoload::Core, and that sounds like a "autoload intervention isn't happening" issue.

[20:55] *** Auzon left
[20:57] <mncharity> pmurias: sorry about the 1/2 latency on my response. :(   the have multiple simultaneous irc channel conversations is a "skill I have no trace of but really should develop". :/

[20:57] <mncharity> *1/2 hour

[21:12] *** rindolf joined
[21:16] <mncharity> re DSLs, the current plan is for the ast-to-ir-handlers, and the core ir node code writing, to remain metaprogrammed, but become file-specific (rather all being together, as in the current elf_b_create.pl), and the resulting code being checked in.  so people who use those modules don't have to care how the module is being written/maintained (any more than CPAN authors do).

[21:16] <mncharity> s/authors/users/

[21:17] <mncharity> I'm slightly tempted by making the dsl's look like p6 code with macros.  but I don't think the cost/benefit is worth it yet.

[21:22] *** rindolf left
[21:27] <mncharity> so I spent some of today on #parrot, answering questions about elf and such.  There's a log at http://www.parrotcode.org/misc/parrotsketch-logs/irclog.parrot-200804/irclog.parrot.20080401 , but it's not easily readable.  not sure it really matters, but fyi.

[21:27] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/3bkv6o

[21:35] <mncharity> looks like svnbot might be down?

[21:37] <mncharity> svnbot is either down, or now has significantly greater latency than previously.

[21:38] <mncharity> Juerd, etal?: ^^^ fyi.

[21:39] <mncharity> irc is almost as bad as meetings.  T+2ish hrs, and barely a line of code which didn't exist at T.  :/

[21:47] <mncharity> anyway, the last three, well, three of the recent svn checkins were adding Moose and autobox version checking to elf_b and elf_c.  pmurias++
