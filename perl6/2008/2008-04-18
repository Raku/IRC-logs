[00:00] <meppl> good night

[00:07] *** meppl left
[00:32] <syle> so i had a big problem with memory earlier and found the problem

[00:32] <syle> freebsd's alloc constantly grows the hash, when i set it to use perl's malloc everything was good

[00:32] <syle> it was so bad that it never freed memory it seemed

[20:43] <pmurias> lichtkind: hi

[20:44] <lichtkind> pmurias: do you know an answer?

[20:44] <lichtkind> pmurias: great to see you

[20:44] <pmurias> lichtkind: i'll look at the spec

[20:44] <pmurias> but if think yes

[20:45] <lichtkind> so not ; ?

[20:45] <moritz_> but only if followed by a newline, right?

[20:45] <pmurias> yes

[20:46] <pmurias> s/if/i/

[20:46] <pmurias> the intention for the rule is not to have an exception so i would be suprised if there was one ;)

[20:47] <moritz_> in p5 you need a ; after 'my $a = sub { ... }', but not after 'sub name { ... }'

[20:48] <moritz_> and one after my $x = do { ... };, but non after a bare (or "do") block

[20:48] <moritz_> so the rule says you don't need them in either case in p6

[20:50] <lichtkind> moritz_: i heard that from larry but was a bit curious if it applies even here
