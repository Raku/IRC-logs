[21:34] <PerlJam> Any moose folk about?  Pass the word: moose.perl.org would be nice  :)

[21:35] * Coke guesses [email@hidden.address]
[21:36] <PerlJam> Ask is probably the right person.

[21:36] <PerlJam> but Coke's guess is as good as any.

[21:36] <Coke> ask is one of the people behind that guess.
