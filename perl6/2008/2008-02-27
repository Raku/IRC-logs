[00:50] <TimToady> wow, an ipv6 addr

[00:51] <alc> :)

[00:52] <TimToady> sorry I had to kick you the other day, but your bot was doing something funny...

[00:52] <alc> i'm sorry for that

[00:52] <alc> just loaded a crappy script

[00:53] <TimToady> I'll bet it was written in a crappy language :)

[00:53] <alc> perl5, FYI :)

[00:53] <TimToady> I was right...

[00:55] <TimToady> I'm afraid, though, that it will still be possible to write buggy programs in Perl 6...

[00:56] <TimToady> but they'll be *better* bugs :)

[00:58] *** alester_ left

[00:58] <TimToady> let's see, given the fact that you're using ipv6, and that you just came on, I'd say you're coming from somewhere in the neighborhood of china

[00:59] <alc> not neighborhood

[00:59] <TimToady> :)

[00:59] <alc> just china 

[00:59] <alc> morning~

[01:01] <TimToady> 你早

[01:02] <alc> 早 :)

[01:02] <TimToady> that's about the limit of my chinese, I'm afraid, though I know a lot of characters from looking at japanese

[01:03] <TimToady> I keep telling myself I'll learn Mandarin as soon as I get fluent in Japanese, but that'll probably never happen... :)

[01:04] <TimToady> anyway, 欢迎

[01:05] <alc> thanks larry. 

[01:05] <alc> how did you input those chinese characters?

[01:06] <TimToady> in this case, I pasted them from my dictionary, though I do have a japanese input method I can use

[01:06] <TimToady> but that tends to use traditional rather than simplified

[01:06] <TimToady> and is missing a lot of characters from your point of view anyway... :)

[01:07] <TimToady> I'm sure that someday I'll work around to putting up a Mandarin input method as well

[01:08] <alc> for that i recommend scim... =)

[01:08] <TimToady> that's what I'm using

[01:12] <TimToady> alc: which input method do you use under scim?

[01:13] <alc> currently, http://code.google.com/p/scim-python/

[01:13] <lambdabot> Title: scim-python - Google Code

[01:15] <alc> once used the 'official' scim-chinese/scim-pinyin

[01:16] <TimToady> I suppose I should stick with the more official one for occasional use

[01:19] <xinming> TimToady: We normally use scim-pinyin in mainland, Some people also uses WuBi, But in TW, people uses other input methods, For WuBi, You'd better live in China to learn WuBi easily. And also, If you want the real original Chinese language. I suggest you stick with Traditional Chinese. :-D

[01:20] <TimToady> I mostly learn the traditional characters in Japanese too, though sometimes they have variants that are neither Traditional nor Simplified

[01:21] <TimToady> 単 for instance

[01:23] <xinming> Those are very small evolution during spreading of Chinese. :-D

[07:33] <JDlugosz> hello masak.

[07:33] <masak> hi there JDlugosz 

[07:33] <masak> I'm reading your question now

[07:33] <JDlugosz> What's wrong with that line?  position 11 is the space after the quote.

[07:33] <masak> where do you get the `?` from?

[07:34] <JDlugosz> Is it normal to be so quiet here with so many logged on?  Or am I having a server problem or everyone in private chats?

[07:34] <masak> I don't remember having to put one of those there.

[07:34] <masak> JDlugosz: it is fairly normal

[07:34] <JDlugosz> The ? is to force boolean context so the match gives me true/false, and prevents a void context.

[07:34] <masak> this used to be a high-trafic channel, and many are still interested

[07:34] <JDlugosz> used to be?

[07:34] <masak> hm

[07:34] <masak> yes

[07:35] <masak> I know that `?` boolifies, but I wouldn't have thought to put it before the regex

[07:35] <JDlugosz> So why is there a huge list of people logged on?

[07:35] <masak> are you sure that's specced? just checking

[07:36] <masak> JDlugosz: because many people are interested in #perl6 and quite a few used to be active

[07:36] <JDlugosz> That is an example from the OReilly book.  It introduces it to prevent accidental void context, and then using ? or + to specify what kind of answer.

[07:36] <masak> nowadays, it's much of a ghost town of logged-in but quiet users

[07:36] <JDlugosz> So what is the user list?  I thought those were people logged on to the channel.

[07:36] <masak> JDlugosz: any book you might have is often wildly out-of-date

[07:37] <masak> not saying that's the case here, just a reminder of that

[07:37] <masak> JDlugosz: they are. they're just not paying attention

[07:37] *** Daveman joined
[07:37] <JDlugosz> Yes, I'll keep that in mind.  But I got errors from Pugs, not syntax errors etc.  So one problem at a time.

[07:37] <masak> many computer users have a stationary computer somewhere where they can be logged in to IRC all the time

[07:38] <masak> JDlugosz: sure

[07:38] <JDlugosz> Hmm, whithout the ? it still can't find a library.

[07:38] <masak> I think pugs should be able to handle regexes

[07:38] *** pbuetow joined
[07:38] <masak> you'd probably do best to try the tests and see what is covered

[07:38] <JDlugosz> But it returns a Match.new object after giving the error.

[07:39] <masak> are you familiar with running tests?

[07:39] <JDlugosz> Yes, I thought Pugs was good with 'rules'.

[07:39] <masak> not sure it is, actually

[07:39] <JDlugosz> No, I'm not.  I downloaded the 't' directory though.  I suppose you just run them like any other code file?

[07:39] <masak> I remember it doing p5 regexes without problem at some point

[07:39] <masak> JDlugosz: yes

[07:39] <JDlugosz> More telling is the content is good examples of what works.

[07:40] <masak> JDlugosz: you can do `make test` but that runs the whole test suite

[07:40] <masak> JDlugosz: the tests are good examples of what works

[07:40] <JDlugosz> I installed the Win32 binary, did not build myself.

[07:40] <masak> hm

[07:41] <masak> you can do `p6prove t/path/file.t` to run individual test files

[07:41] <JDlugosz> Hmm, why would it know that this is a p5 regex?  I thought it defaulted to rules, and I did not use an adjective.

[07:41] <masak> JDlugosz: yes, sure

[07:42] <masak> it's just that things are under construction and, in the case of pugs, left in a half-finished state

[07:42] <masak> so things don't always work according to spec

[07:42] *** Aankhen`` joined
[07:43] <JDlugosz> Well, the book does that, so maybe it autodetects simple cases.

[07:44] <JDlugosz> My immediate problem is getting Pugs to load the libraries correctly.

[07:44] <JDlugosz> The INC doesn't match...?

[07:44] <masak> JDlugosz: my guess is that the eventual answer you will get from people who know more than I do is, that something in Pugs is broken and might not get fixed until someone finds massive tuits to do it

[07:44] <masak> but on the other hand, it might just be a library problem

[07:45] <JDlugosz> Is there any newsgroup or forum for Pugs?

[07:46] *** xinming joined
[07:47] <JDlugosz> still there, masak?

[07:47] <masak> yes

[07:47] <masak> JDlugosz: apart from #perl6? perl6-users might be it

[07:47] <JDlugosz> Thanks.

[07:48] <masak> np

[07:48] <JDlugosz> I'm going to "ghost" myself a bit, and check back later to see if there was any traffic.

[07:48] <masak> good idea.

[07:48] <masak> good luck

[07:49] <JDlugosz> I guess there is no social protocol for that here?  I remember saying "AFK" (away from keyboard) or being able to put a mark on the name in the logged-on list.

[07:52] <masak> you can do either, or neither. it's up to you

[07:52] <masak> but generally on IRC, it's a good idea to assume that a user is not immediately available, unless she has said something in the last minute or so.

[17:20] <obra> wait. sorry. I thought you were talking about string extraction for, say, I18N.

[17:20] <obra> if you want something for perl that works like JSP, look at HTML::Mason
