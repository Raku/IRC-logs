[16:59] <Teratogen> is perl 6 different enough from perl 5 that we should call it something else?

[17:02] <wolverian> if that was the only criteria, yes, in my opinion.

[17:03] <wolverian> but it's an old bone. :)

[17:04] <Teratogen> maybe call ie paskell

[17:05] <moritz_> Teratogen: no. Haskell is an "extreme" language, i.e. it forbids much

[17:05] <allbery_b> perlng?  oyster?  :)

[17:05] <moritz_> like untyped variables, side effects etc.

[17:05] <moritz_> and perl 6 tries not to forbid anything that might be usefull

[17:08] <Auzon> moritz_: You sent me an email a few days ago about mentoring me for GSoC, and I just wanted to say hi and thanks :)

[17:08] <Juerd> Teratogen: In my opinion, yes. It would avoid lots and lots of confusion.

[17:09] <moritz_> Auzon: I got your reply. YW.

[17:09] <Juerd> Teratogen: But the name Perl belongs to TimToady of course, and he decided that Perl 6 be Perl 6.

[17:09] <moritz_> Auzon: btw the chances are good that it will be accepted

[17:09] <Auzon> Good to hear, thanks.

[17:09] <Juerd> Auzon: Do you need/want a feather account?

[17:10] <Auzon> I read about TPF only getting a few slots for GSoC, which was surprising. But I guess not every project can be accepted.

[17:10] <moritz_> Auzon: your project is currently leading the internal ranking of the TPF supported projects

[17:11] <Auzon> Juerd: I don't see any use for it right now, but I don't know what all feather could do for me

[17:16] <PerlJam> Auzon: what was your proposal?

[17:16] <Auzon> To add/update 1000 test cases to the Pugs test suite ("Flesh out the Perl 6 test suite")

[17:17] <Auzon> Focusing mainly on adding, and going through every finalized spec.

[17:18] <PerlJam> Auzon: feather could give you a place to work where you don't have to build thjings from scratch

[17:20] <Auzon> Hm. Yeah, that would be pretty useful.

[17:55] <mncharity> spinclad: thanks.  /me passively hopes a not-too-distant fedora update will make it go away. :)

[17:56] <mncharity> re ::Foo, yeah.  Just need to wire up the Type IR node, so typenames don't hit the IR as strings.

[17:57] <mncharity> ﻿pmurias: how goes separate compilation?

[17:57] <pmurias> haven't done much coding :(

[17:58] <pmurias> would using .pmc be a good idea?

[17:58] <mncharity> mind if I take a quick attempt at it?  i'm pursuaded.  seeing nomoose wiz by reminded me - we trade chucks of life for bits of code... best they be small chunks.

[18:00] <pmurias> mncharity: i can code it later tomorrow if you can wait ;)

[18:00] <mncharity> re pmc, my impression is not.  I like your --builddir=foo/  ...    foo/Mumble.pm  idea.  At least until our directories get more complex, at which point a --cachedir would be simpler.

[18:00] <mncharity> can wait. :)

[18:03] <pmurias> is there need for files being named ElfLetterMumble instead  of ElfMumble?

[18:05] <mncharity> or Mumble.  The motivation for ElfX_Mumble was that you could assemble your own elf out of parts from different versions.  Which you can't do with @INC if they are named the same.  Alternative is to have Mumble, and ElfX.pm say 'use ../elf_d_src/Mumble;'  instead of  'use ElfD_Mumble;'.

[18:06] <pmurias> is there any need for assembling a mixed version elf?

[18:08] <mncharity> no one is yet actually using elf.  ie, going off in a corner and using elf to make say a Common Lisp backend.  so not yet.

[18:08] <mncharity> you are finding it ugly/annoying?

[18:09] <pmurias> it's a mildly annoying

[18:09] <pmurias> and a hack as perl6 has support for doing it cleanly by requesting a particular version of a module

[18:09] <mncharity> lol

[18:10] <mncharity> Perl 6 != elf

[18:10] <mncharity> :)

[18:10] <Juerd> elf = 11

[18:11] <mncharity> ok, maybe try elf_f in Mumble mode.

[18:11] <mncharity> or try modifying elf_e, if it remains active for a while

[18:11] <mncharity> "11"?

[18:12] <mncharity> 3 binary?

[18:14] *** justatheory joined
[18:15] <moritz_> "elf" is the German word for eleven

[18:16] <mncharity> ahhhhh :)

[18:20] <Juerd> Also the Dutch word.

[18:20] <mncharity> so the files that would change are ElfD_CommandLine.pm ElfD_Compiler.pm ElfD_Parser.pm ElfD_PluggableCommandLine.pm .  They could become Mumble.  Then ElfD.pm ElfD_NoMoose.pm ElfD_Pluggable.pm could become Elf_Mumble.

[18:21] <pmurias> i thought of copying over everything which is needed and removing the {E,D}

[18:22] <mncharity> The other reason for the explicit names is to be sure of what you are getting.  No wasting debugging time because use() was malfunctioning, or -I was wrong, or... .

[18:27] <pmurias> it's only annoying when migrating stuff so it's not a big deal

[18:30] <mncharity>  /me renaming elf_d to see what it looks like...

[18:32] <pmurias> there is no mkdir in S29?

[18:32] <moritz_> pmurias: perhaps it's in IO?

[18:33] <moritz_> yes, it is
