[18:42] *** meppl left
[18:43] <pmurias> ruoso: hi

[18:43] <ruoso> hi pmurias 

[18:44] <pmurias> we can always overwrite the s1p stuff in the lexical prelude once better stuff is avalible

[18:46] <pmurias> one thing i'm not sure how to solve is that in order for ./m0ld to be able to execute .m0ld code it needs to be linked with smop and smop requires ./m0ld to compile

[18:48] <ruoso> that's bootstrap :)

[18:49] <ruoso> pmurias, we need to start delimiting the barrier on the minimal smop feature-set

[18:49] <ruoso> and the additional libraries

[18:50] <pmurias> it wouldn't help in this case

[18:50] <ruoso> pmurias, ok... maybe I'm not seeing the real problem... please ellaborate

[18:51] <pmurias> ./m0ld compiles m0ld to c

[18:52] <pmurias> and i want it (have it in my working copy) to also be able to execute .m0ld withought a c compiler

[18:52] <pmurias> * without

[18:53] <pmurias> but for this it needs to have a linked in smop (which needs preprocessing by ./m0ld)

[18:53] <ruoso> we need a 1st-stage m0ld compiler

[18:53] <ruoso> that doesn't depend on smop

[18:53] <pmurias> i could either split it in to executable or add a flag and compile ./m0ld 2 times

[18:54] <pmurias> s/to executable/2 executables

[18:54] <ruoso> yeah... exactly

[18:54] *** ab5tract joined
[18:54] <ruoso> you have a build option FIRST_STAGE that doesn't link to smop

[18:54] <ruoso> and after that you can rebuild without that option

[18:56] <pmurias> doing it

[18:58] *** Jedai left
[18:58] *** Jedai joined
[19:01] <ruoso> pmurias, btw... you said mildew was blocking on runtime support...

[19:07] <pmurias> having a convenient way to feed .m0ld into smop is required

[19:07] <ruoso> you mean like a bytecode

[19:07] <pmurias> well a ./m0ld --exec option will be enough for now

[19:08] <ruoso> pmurias, ah... I see... so that mildew can execute directly

[19:09] <pmurias> instead of feeding into the smop build system, yes

[19:09] <ruoso> right... so what you're doing right now solves it

[19:09] <pmurias> yes

[19:10] <pmurias> mildew will block on small stuff such as &say, infix:<~> if we want to run even a small part of the test suit

[19:11] <ruoso> pmurias, I was considering writing that in Perl 6 already

[20:05] <pmurias> can anyone suggest a build system that isn't a pile of strange syntax and doesn't get in the way when trying to do something moderatly complex?

[20:05] <ruoso> pmurias, how do I run './Setup configure --flags=SMOP'... I couldn't find "Setup" inside m0ld

[20:05] <masak> pmurias: ant seems pretty nice.

[20:05] <ruoso> noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

[20:05] <masak> don't know if you count XML as "strange"

[20:06] <ruoso> please... I've suffered enough on ant's hand...

[20:06] <pmurias> the syntax can be strange the semantics shouldn't be

[20:06] <masak> all the semantics I want from a build system is Directed Acyclic Graphs.

[20:07] <pmurias> i just want to define custom rules

[20:47] <ruoso> and it doesn't find it
