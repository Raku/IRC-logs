[03:23] <pugs_svn> r22586 | putter++ | [elfish/STD_blue] Improved guessing of rule names.  And --format=p5a quoting of same.  Kludge to cope with STD graph cycles.

[03:25] <mncharity> TimToady: My fuzzy impression is viv is identifying the originating rule of a Match by "my parent called me X, and since STD never uses :=, I'm then definitely category X, and the rest of my rule name can be found in 'sym'".  yes?

[03:27] <mncharity> TimToady: before I look too hard at it, any suggestions on unnecessary fields which might be dropped in order to render the STD Match graph acyclic?  If you don't know, np, I'll explore/deal.

[04:44] <TimToady> @tell mncharity while there are duplicate subtrees, I don't think there is much there that prevents it from being a DAG.  There aren't any pointers "uphill"that I know of.  your impression of how it works is pretty accurate
