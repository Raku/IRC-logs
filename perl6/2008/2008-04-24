[09:23] <weirdo> hi

[09:23] <weirdo> what is the rationale for the presence of sigils in perl6?

[09:24] <masak> weirdo: same as in perl5 I guess

[09:24] <masak> they form little namespaces in themselves

[09:24] <masak> marking "scalar", "array" and "hash" because these properties are deemed worthy of marking

[09:25] <weirdo> i found typing "push @{$foo->{bar}}" particularly tiring. don't such cases overweight the benefit of having syntactic sugar for symbol cells?

[09:28] <xinming> weirdo: In perl 6, an [] auto deferences depending on the context, so, IMO, $foo.bar.push() is enough in perl 6. ;-)

[09:29] <wolverian> $foo<bar>.push

[09:29] <xinming> weirdo: every thing in perl 6 is an object, and for array and hash, they are automatically deferences.

[09:30] <xinming> wolverian: ;-) there should be an accessor. :-D

[09:30] <wolverian> hashes are not illegal... even in perl 6 :)

[09:30] <weirdo> any progress on macro specification?

[09:30] <wolverian> (but hash is!)

[09:30] <xinming> weirdo: wolverian is right.

[09:30] *** Zaba left
[09:31] <wolverian> weirdo, the spec has some things on macros.

[09:31] <weirdo> can an equivalent of a PROG2 lisp macro be easily defined?

[09:31] <wolverian> http://perlcabal.org/syn/S06.html#Macros

[09:31] <lambdabot> Title: S06

[09:32] <xinming> weirdo: read the synopsis, and you will see the what language features after 20 years we still use. :-)

[09:33] <weirdo> do i see correctly, the spec defined macros as text to be parsed with regexes?

[09:34] <wolverian> macros may return strings as code or syntax trees.

[09:34] <weirdo> can macros accept syntax trees as argument?

[09:34] <weirdo> s/arguments

[09:36] <wolverian> the spec seems to indicate so.

[09:37] <wolverian> I'm  very unfamiliar with lisp macros, so I can't really say any better, sorry.

[09:37] <wolverian> I suppose I'm equally unfamiliar with perl 6 macros. :)

[09:38] <wolverian> but, yes, the arguments are ASTs, afaik.

[09:39] <weirdo> IMO perl could win really big with adequate macros

[09:39] <wolverian> well, if you don't think the macros in the spec are adequate enough, please suggest improvements (here or on perl6-language) 

[09:39] <wolverian> if, on the other hand, you think the spec is simply unclear, do the same. :)

[09:41] <weirdo> i haven't yet researched the matter, but i don't understand why macros aren't simple nested arrayrefs

[09:42] <wolverian> probably because perl 6's syntax isn't sexprs?

[09:43] <weirdo> the main question is whether non-trivial cases can be expressed as perl macros, but i yet have to get a recent pugs trunk to check them out :-)

[09:44] <weirdo> if a DESTRUCTURING-BIND common-lisp macro could be expressed in a not-so-hairy way, they would be really adequate :-)

[09:44] <wolverian> I don't know if pugs has macros at all.. 

[09:44] <weirdo> is there any implementation that does?

[09:44] <wolverian> I don't think so

[09:44] <wolverian> (if pugs doesn't have them)

[09:44] <wolverian> pugs: macro foo { 'bar' }

[09:45] <exp_evalbot> RESULT[\macro :(@_) "$_" := "Scalar" #<Scalar:0xb71c8b04>␤            "@_" := "Array" #<Array:0xb71c76fc>␤            "&?ROUTINE" := "Sub" #<Sub:0xb6604cec>␤            "&?BLOCK" := "Sub" #<Sub:0xb6604cec> {"&foo" := "Sub" #<Sub:0xb7a18830>, "$_" := "Scalar" #<Scalar:0xb7170ce8>␤                   

[09:45] <exp_evalbot> ..                                               ...

[09:45] <wolverian> hmm, I guess pugs does have them in some form

[09:45] <wolverian> rakudo: macro foo { 'bar' }

[09:45] <exp_evalbot> OUTPUT[Null PMC access in invoke()␤current instr.: '_block10' pc 28 (EVAL_11:14)␤called from Sub 'parrot;PCT::HLLCompiler;eval' pc 785 (src/PCT/HLLCompiler.pir:458)␤called from Sub 'parrot;PCT::HLLCompiler;evalfiles' pc 1067 (src/PCT/HLLCompiler.pir:587)␤called from Sub

[09:45] <exp_evalbot> ..'parrot;PCT::HLLCompiler;command_line' pc 1246 (src/PCT/HLLCompiler.pir:676)...

[09:45] <wolverian> rakudo doesn't :)

[09:47] <wolverian> I have no idea what destructuring-bind does, even after reading the lisp spec :)

[09:47] <weirdo> destructuring-bind binds variables to contents of an expression returning a list

[09:48] <weirdo> perl5 only allows shallow destructuring, i.e. my ($foo, $bar, @baz) = (1 .. 42)

[09:49] <weirdo> d-bind allows recursive destructuring, i.e. (destructuring-bind (foo (bar baz &key test on-error)) ...)

[09:50] <wolverian> I think you can do arbitrary destructuring (extraction / pattern matching in haskell parlance) in any signature context

[09:50] <wolverian> see e.g. http://perlcabal.org/syn/S06.html#Unpacking_array_parameters and the sections following it in subroutine argument context

[09:50] <lambdabot> Title: S06

[09:51] <weirdo> i'm not interested in destructuring in particular :) i've only arbitrarily appointed destructuring as a test of a macro facility's capabilities

[09:52] <wolverian> ah.

[09:52] <wolverian> well, I don't see why not, as long as your argument grammar specification is loose enough.. 

[09:53] <weirdo> well, that's the problem with algol-ish syntax :/

[09:53] <weirdo>  

[09:54] <wolverian> the grammar is available to the user, so perhaps it's not a problem.

[13:28] <pmurias> weirdo: the macros should be powerfull enough to compile passed code and load it through NCI

[13:30] <pmurias> allowing a lispish destructuring bind

[13:30] <pmurias> say "this is perl"; (destructuring-bind ((a &optional (b 'bee)) one two three)

[13:30] <pmurias>      `((alpha) ,@(iota 3))

[13:31] <pmurias> ;say "this is still perl"

[13:31] <pmurias> should be possible also

[13:41] <weirdo> don't mind the parens :)

[13:41] <weirdo> i mean, it doesn't actually have lisp syntax

[13:42] *** yves joined
[13:43] <weirdo> something along the lines of destructuring-bind ($a, $b, ($c, $d, @f)) { ... } perfectly demonstrates expressibility of a macro facility :)
