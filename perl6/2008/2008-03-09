[07:31] <cheney> is there a nation which rewards its citizens for investment income by allowing it to go untaxed?

[07:33] *** Jedai joined
[07:39] <cheney> NO WONDER the USA has a NEGATIVE SAVINGS RATE.

[07:39] <cheney> they say FECK it and they just spend it in the moment.

[07:40] <cheney> our economy is HURTING because our citizens are afraid to invest their hard-earned dollars.

[07:40] <cheney> because they are afraid of the tax ramifications.

[07:42] <cheney> the tax headaches of investing my money in this economy are too much for me.

[07:42] <cheney> i am not the only one.

[07:46] <FurnaceBoy> ...

[07:46] <FurnaceBoy> the 3 trillion cost of the war isn't helping, methinks

[07:47] <FurnaceBoy> write to your congressman about that... maybe time travel can help

[07:56] <Alias_> <cheney> is there a nation which rewards its citizens for investment income by allowing it to go untaxed?

[07:56] <Alias_> Yes, Australia does

[07:57] <Alias_> Within certain limits

[07:57] <cheney> what limits?

[07:57] <Alias_> http://use.perl.org/~Alias/journal/35651

[07:57] <lambdabot> Title: Journal of Alias (5735)

[07:58] <Alias_> In short, it has to be into a private pension account

[07:58] <Alias_> (That you can't access until you retire)

[07:58] <Alias_> And it has to be above and beyond the employer's compulsory amount

[07:58] <Alias_> And it's not removed entirely, just reduced

[07:59] <Alias_> Instead of top tax rate of 40%ish, it gets taxed at 15%

[07:59] <Alias_> But although it's a "pension account" it's still YOUR money

[07:59] <Alias_> Details in the journal post

[08:00] *** Schwern joined
[08:03] <Alias_> Oh, and for low income earners, they will do co-contributions

[08:03] <Alias_> If you don't make much money, but you put in $1000, the government will match it with another $1000 of their own

[09:17] <integral> UK has "ISAs" which (for cash) can be just like a normal saving's account but with a limit on contributions within a tax year (Â£3000)

[09:18] *** barney joined
[09:36] *** chris2_ joined
[09:38] <Alias_> A savings account you can't put much money into?

[09:38] <Alias_> Whatever are they for?

[09:42] <integral> hmm?  that's just one years limit.
