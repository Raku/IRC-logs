[00:26] <cspencer> should a Range reversed return another Range object?

[00:39] <pmichaud> reversing a range also reverses its :by value, iirc.

[00:42] <cspencer> right, that would make sense too :)

[00:42] <pmichaud> I'm waiting to see how Parrot decides to handle it.

[00:42] <cspencer> ok

[00:43] <pmichaud> at this point it's not likely to become a separate class, unless the spec says it has to be one.

[12:15] <masak> aye. all I know is I fell into the trap, and I consider myself a fairly seasoned Perl 6 user.

[12:15] <pmurias> it's also depends if people will want to use {} interpolation legitimately

[17:44] <pmichaud> dwhipp: there are a number of people (and some tests) that claim that .map should not work on scalars.  (I disagree.)

[17:44] <pmichaud> in this instance, the complaint is essentially that Str doesn't have a .map method.

[17:46] <dwhipp> actually, my complaint would be that <...> is a list constructor -- so shouldn't behave differently when quoting only one ele,

[17:46] <pmichaud> <...>  is *not* a list constructor.

[17:46] <pmichaud> <A>  is same as ('A')

[17:46] <pmichaud> which is a Str

[17:47] <cspencer> should S05-substitution/[match | subst].t spec tests be failing at the moment?

[17:47] <pmichaud> cspencer: I don't think they should no.

[17:47] <cspencer> hmmm, maybe i need a parrot rebuild then

[17:48] <dwhipp> OK ... but it still causes a nasty edge case when passed one elem -- reduces scalability of code

[17:48] <pmichaud> dwhipp: which is why I think .map should treat a scalar as a list of one element.

[17:48] <pmichaud> .join already does this.

[17:50] <dwhipp> yup, I vote that it's a list of one elem

[19:33] *** bacek joined
[19:34] <ruoso> TimToady, btw... I agree it's a little weird that we CATCH but don't throw

[19:35] <TimToady> so maybe just go with throw for now, esp if it's only a method

[19:36] <ruoso> right... but that doesn't solve the problem for control exceptions

[19:36] <ruoso> because I presume we need two different functions to that,

[19:36] <TimToady> throw can be generic

[19:36] <ruoso> and it checks if $_ ~~ Failure? 

[19:37] <ruoso> sounds a little bit boring to do that everytime

[19:37] <ruoso> when you have so clear difference between the scenarios

[19:38] <TimToady> point

[19:38] <ruoso> 'abnormal flow' in one word?

[19:40] <TimToady> well, .throwcontrol is dehuffmanized then

[19:41] <ruoso> well, it certainly is dehuffmanized, it's even de-pretty-ized

[19:41] <ruoso> not to say ugly-ized

[19:41] <ruoso> :)

[19:41] <TimToady> we want to encourage people to use goto instead  :)

[19:41] <ruoso> heh

[19:41] <ruoso> what about loose ??

[19:42] <ruoso> heh

[19:42] <TimToady> maybe even .throw_control_exception

[19:42] <TimToady> slightly less ugly

[19:42] <ruoso> indeed

[19:42] <ruoso> well

[19:43] <TimToady> I was thinking we try to avoid _ in builtins, but there's prefix_circumfix_meta_operator

[19:43] <ruoso> I was considering those as functions, not methods

[19:43] <ruoso> if we consider as methods, we can just use throw

[19:43] <TimToady> THROW_CONTROL_EXCEPTION is really hard to type without capslock

[19:44] <TimToady> so maybe just give the CONTROL exceptions long names :)

[19:44] <ruoso> I was assuming ControlException to be part of their name

[19:44] <ruoso> like ReturnControlException

[19:44] <TimToady> something to be said for ControlException in front instead

[19:44] <TimToady> then you can line them up nicer

[19:45] <ruoso> hm?

[19:45] <TimToady> ControlExceptionReturn

[19:45] <TimToady> ControlExceptionNext

[19:45] <TimToady> ControlExceptionLast

[19:45] <TimToady> ControlExceptionGoto

[19:45] <ruoso> ok, got it... makes sense...

[19:45] <ruoso> so there's no fail()-like function for control exceptions 

[19:46] <ruoso> and .throw is how you raise an exception by using its object

[19:46] <ruoso> (being Failure or Control Exception)

[19:46] <pmichaud> .throw was my first thought when this came up.

[19:46] <ruoso> I had my mind looking for functions, for some reason

[19:48] <ruoso> but making it as methods only makes much sense

[19:48] <ruoso> fail is a conveninence function, just like return
