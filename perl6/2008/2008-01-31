[17:36] <ruoso> I was thinking better about the autoboxing... 

[17:36] <ruoso> considering $continuation.has_next()

[17:36] <ruoso> this method should return true or false,

[17:36] <mofino> can it punch you if you use it incorrectly?

[17:37] <ruoso> that's the point... how should I deal with it?

[17:37] <mofino> I don't know of any autoboxing devices

[17:38] <ruoso> in theory it can return something that is not a proper Bool value

[17:38] <mofino> (I have no idea what you are talking about)

[17:38] <mofino> :)

[17:38] <ruoso> in the lowlevel implementation, when I call $continuation.has_next() it returns a SMOP__Object*

[17:38] <mofino> ok

[17:39] <ruoso> should I take additional checking steps?

[17:40] *** allbery_b left
[17:40] <[particle]> does SMOP__Object have a .true() method?

[17:40] <ruoso> SMOP__Object* doesn't have any method... it have only MESSAGE

[17:40] *** allbery_b joined
[17:40] * mofino backs away slowly

[17:41] <ruoso> the methods are implemented inside the message call

[17:41] <ruoso> the way the responder interface decides to

[17:41] <[particle]> where is SMOP__Object defined?

[17:42] <ruoso> include/smop_base.h

[17:42] *** ebassi joined
[17:43] <ruoso> the thing is how do I make the autoboxing?

[17:43] <mofino> autoboxing?

[17:43] <ruoso> my bool $a = $obj.Bool;

[17:44] <mofino> ...

[17:44] <ruoso> bool is a native type... native types are the only ones I know the C lowlevel struct for

[17:44] <mofino> forces $a to be a bool?

[17:44] <ruoso> all others I only know how to call its responder interface

[17:44] <mofino> or rather, predefines $a to be a bool?

[17:45] <mofino> ok

[17:45] <ruoso> mofino, I'm talking in much lower level

[17:45] <mofino> right

[17:46] <ruoso> what makes it really complicated is the stackless thing...

[17:46] <mofino> you mean this isn't complicated in itself?

[17:46] <mofino> could've fooled me

[17:47] <ruoso> because I need to be able to autobox from the high-level object to the native type without recursing

[17:48] <mofino> I see... I think.

[17:48] <ruoso> because the code that runs the interpreter needs to autobox the return of the $continuation.has_next() call to the native bool

[17:49] <ruoso> so it can decide if it will run the next operation

[17:50] *** jjore left
[17:51] <ruoso> one thing I can do is to force the signature of this low-level methods to return the native bool and fail otherwise

[17:51] <ruoso> hmmm

[17:51] <[particle]> that's i think what i was getting at with the .true() comment

[17:51] <ruoso> hmmm

[23:05] <rhr_> TimToady: can we have :nf<xx> and :enc<xx> regex modifiers to go along with :codes etc.? e.g. token :codes :nf<d> {...}

[23:06] <moritz_> why not :codes<nfd> and :bytes<utf-8>?

[23:06] <TimToady> :bytes would also need to know normalization

[23:06] <rhr_> bytes needs nf also

[23:06] <moritz_> right

[23:07] <TimToady> though I suppose one could make a case for :bytes<nfd utf-8>

[23:07] <TimToady> or vice versa

[23:08] <TimToady> but I don't see a strong argument either way for bundling/unbundling

[23:09] <rhr_> me either

[23:09] <TimToady> bundling associates it more clearly in people's minds

[23:10] <TimToady> and I don't know that :enc makes any sense without :bytes

[23:10] <moritz_> same with :nf<d> without :codes

[23:10] <TimToady> (or :bytes)

[23:11] <TimToady> on the other hand it could be viewed as setting a lexical default

[23:11] <rhr_> it seems unlikely you'd want a particular nf but not care about codes/bytes

[23:11] <TimToady> "whenever I say :codes below I mean :nf<d>"
