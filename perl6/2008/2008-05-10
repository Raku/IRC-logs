[00:16] <mncharity> i think this was discussed recently...  is 'map:{3}' valid, or must it be 'map :{3}' (with a space)?  anyone know?

[00:22] <eternaleye> mncharity: 

[00:22] <eternaleye> [Thu May 8 2008] [15:01:15] <moritz_>   we had the discussion what $obj.math:{block} means

[00:22] <eternaleye> [Thu May 8 2008] [15:01:35] <moritz_>   and it turned out to be parsed as $obj.meth :{block}

[00:23] <eternaleye> I'll pastebin the relevant porion of my logs

[00:24] *** [particle3 joined

[00:28] <mncharity> TimToady: (12) is the | in 'sub f(|$c) {}' parsed?  hint?

[00:34] <spinclad> mncharity: re (10), @%(...) should be parsed @(%(...)) ?   -- (but then @@ is a single sigil? hmm)

[00:34] <spinclad> (haven't looked at STD on this to see the issue...)

[00:41] <mncharity> oh.  hmm.  that would be odd wouldn't it.  re @%() being @(%()), yeah, that looks like what was intended.   t/data_types/hash.t

[00:41] *** tobeya left
[00:42] <mncharity> try{ @%(a => <b>)<a> };  ok( $!, "doesn't really make sense, but shouldn't segfault, either ($!)");

[00:43] <mncharity> but at least re STD, looks like a parsefail.

[00:44] <mncharity> circumfix:sigil

[00:48] <mncharity> TimToady: (4 addendum) also re fatarrow using <ident> for the key, t/spec/S29-str/split.t has a '1 =>'.

[00:50] <mncharity> and STD_red non-choking on t/ passes 60% of files.  yay!  pause.  back to slogging...

[00:55] <mncharity> TimToady: (13) ... let me know if you ever get tired of these ...   routine_def uses ident which is \w* so   'sub postfix:<!!!> ($x){3}' doesn't parse.

[00:57] <mncharity> anything:whatever too.

[00:58] <mncharity> not that I'm at all looking forward to trying to make such declarations actually affect parsing. :/

[00:59] <mncharity> nothing like trying to duplicate it to remind oneself what an accomplishment pugs was/is.

[02:41] <mncharity> hopefully I'll have some time this weekend.  plan is to knock off a few more causes of parsefails, so we at least seem to potentially have a good set of accessible tests, then fork the next elf, and then begin knocking off test failures, fleshing out the compiler and prelude.

[15:32] <rindolf> Hi pbuetow 

[15:33] <pbuetow> i hope i ll do more perl this summer, no time for perl atm :/

[15:33] <rindolf> pbuetow: I'm fine. More or less finished writing a new essay.

[15:33] <rindolf> pbuetow: called "Elements of Perfect Info-Tech Workplace".

[15:33] <rindolf> pbuetow: ah.

[15:33] <pbuetow> rindolf: cool

[15:33] <rindolf> pbuetow: what kind of Perl?

[15:33] <pbuetow> rindolf: can i see it?

[15:33] <rindolf> pbuetow: are you a student?

[15:33] <rindolf> pbuetow: sure.

[15:33] <rindolf> pbuetow: http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/software-management/perfect-workplace/

[15:34] <lambdabot> Title: Index of /philosophy/computers/software-management/perfect-workplace, http://tinyurl.com/6o4kxz

[15:34] <pbuetow> rindolf: yes, and that's the reason why i dont have a lot time left for perl, i am wriiting my diploma thesis in java.

[15:34] <rindolf> pbuetow: ah.

[15:34] <rindolf> pbuetow: I hope Java is not causing you too many problems.

[15:35] <pbuetow> rindolf: "Objectoriented and synchronous Simulation of Protocols of Distributed Systems with GUI" <- Well it's not the official title, the official title is in german :)

[15:35] <rindolf> pbuetow: ah.

[15:35] <pbuetow> rindolf: well i've no problems with Java, everything works well :)

[15:36] <pbuetow> wow 12 pages

[15:36] <rindolf> pbuetow: I recall a commercial network simulator back at the Com-Net lab in the Technion.

[15:36] <rindolf> pbuetow: the PDF?

[15:36] <pbuetow> yes.

[15:36] <rindolf> <pbuetow> rindolf: well i've no problems with Java, everything works well :) - ah, that's good.

[15:37] <pbuetow> it's just a programming language. and i think, for this purpose (my thesis) java is better than perl. 

[15:38] <pbuetow> rindolf: did you write it for fun or for $job?

[15:39] <rindolf> pbuetow: for fun.

[15:39] <pbuetow> nice :)

[15:39] <rindolf> pbuetow: and for profit.

[15:39] <rindolf> pbuetow: well, PageRank, publicity, AdSense, etc.

[15:39] <pbuetow> rindolf: my simulator will be open source too. but i've to think about a license. maybe GPL.

[15:39] <pbuetow> so it's good for publicity etc :)

[15:40] <rindolf> pbuetow: I also wrote http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/high-quality-software/ and publicised it.

[15:40] <lambdabot> Title: What Makes Software High-Quality?, http://tinyurl.com/5lxnq5

[15:40] <rindolf> pbuetow: got a lot of publicity from it thanks to OSNews.com and other places.

[15:40] <pbuetow> ah cewl

[15:40] <rindolf> pbuetow: ah, do you know what the implications of the GPL are?

[15:40] <pbuetow> i read OSNews.com too :)

[15:41] <pbuetow> rindolf: well, the main idea i know

[15:41] <rindolf> pbuetow: well, I had a good experience in them accepting some of my submissions.

[15:41] <rindolf> Not all, but enough.

[15:41] <rindolf> pbuetow: you realise you can only link to GPLed code if the code is GPL-compatible, right? 

[15:41] <pbuetow> after my thesis is done, i ll translate it into the english language (at least the simulator itself and short howto's)

[15:42] <pbuetow> rindolf: yes, but i am not using any library, instead of Java's stuff itself

[15:42] <rindolf> pbuetow: you mean, the Simulator is in German, now?

[15:42] <pbuetow> rindolf: yes

[15:42] <rindolf> pbuetow: yes, but other people may wish to use your code.

[15:42] <rindolf> pbuetow: well, for standalone apps GPL is OK.

[15:43] <rindolf> But for libraries it may be probelmatic.

[15:43] <pbuetow> yes.

[15:43] <rindolf> In any case, I'm using MIT X11 for almost all of my code.

[15:43] <rindolf> Well, my original code.

[15:43] <pbuetow> what is different from this lic?

[15:46] <lambdabot> Title: Journal of Shlomi Fish (918)

[15:46] <pbuetow> in summer, i plan to extend Xerl (which is my own little perl script for my websites) so it can be used as a blog!

[15:46] <rindolf> pbuetow: MIT X11 is practically Public-Domain.

[15:46] <rindolf> pbuetow: I see.

[15:47] <rindolf> pbuetow: ah.

[15:47] <rindolf> pbuetow: I'm looking for a Blog Engine now.

[15:47] <rindolf> pbuetow: but something more serious.

[15:47] <rindolf> pbuetow: I Also need comments.

[15:47] <pbuetow> rindolf: Movable Type?

[15:47] <rindolf> pbuetow: and categories.

[15:47] <moritz_> rindolf: livejournal? ;-)

[15:47] <rindolf> pbuetow: I tried MT and didn't like it.

[15:47] <pbuetow> hm!

[15:47] <rindolf> moritz_: I'm already on LJ.

[15:47] <pbuetow> rindolf: has it to be perl?

[15:47] <rindolf> moritz_: but I want something I can put on my hosting.

[15:48] <rindolf> pbuetow: no, PHP and Py and possibly also Ruby can be fine.

[15:48] <pbuetow> rindolf: my blog will be only usable via ssh and vi ;P

[15:48] <rindolf> pbuetow: it has a weirdo static HTML caching thing.

[15:48] <rindolf> pbuetow: MT I mean.

[15:48] <pbuetow> rindolf: i have Wordpress atm

[15:48] <rindolf> pbuetow: and it created many world-writable files.

[15:48] <rindolf> pbuetow: ah.

[15:48] <rindolf> pbuetow: WordPress has a lot of bugs.

[15:48] <pbuetow> every other week security update, sucks :/

[15:49] <rindolf> pbuetow: yes.

[15:49] <pbuetow> but i want to migrate to my Xerl Blog. if it's ready.

[15:49] <rindolf> pbuetow: it it upgraded as part of the OS?

[15:49] <rindolf> pbuetow: ah.

[15:49] <rindolf> pbuetow: I'll try out some other engines.

[15:50] <pbuetow> ah thx

[15:51] <pbuetow> may be one license which would fit too

[15:52] <rindolf> pbuetow: the MIT X11 is the exact opposite in its FOSS philosophy than the GPL.

[15:52] <pbuetow> i ll talk with my prof about the license. he just told me: public domain

[15:52] <rindolf> pbuetow: it allows sub-licensing, which means you can make it proprietary.

[15:52] <rindolf> pbuetow: do they have the PD where you're at?

[15:52] <rindolf> pbuetow: MIT X11 is a pseudo-PD licence.

[15:52] <pbuetow> PD?

[15:53] <pbuetow> what's PD?

[15:53] <rindolf> pbuetow: see the thread - http://use.perl.org/~Shlomi+Fish/journal/36050

[15:53] <lambdabot> Title: Journal of Shlomi Fish (918)

[15:53] <rindolf> pbuetow: PD == Public Domain.

[15:53] <pbuetow> ah, lol

[15:53] <pbuetow> ok

[15:53] <rindolf> pbuetow: where are you located?

[15:53] <pbuetow> <- stupid

[15:53] <rindolf> What do you mean by WDYM?

[15:54] <pbuetow> rindolf: Aachen, Germany (Most west City of Germany, Near Duesseldorf and Cologne). Right next to Belgium and Holland.

[15:54] <rindolf> pbuetow: ah.

[15:54] <rindolf> pbuetow: so I don't think .de has a Public-Domain equivalent.

[15:54] <rindolf> pbuetow: you should use MIT X11 probably.

[15:54] <rindolf> pbuetow: if you don't want to use the LGPL, GPL, SleepyCat Licence, etc.

[15:55] <pbuetow> yes, and no beer license (i will get drunk every day, because all students are supposed to use my software in the distributed systems class)

[15:57] <rindolf> pbuetow: ah yes, beerware.

[16:01] <moritz_> I actually published one (small) piece of software under the WTFPL

[16:01] <rindolf> pbuetow: ah.

[16:01] <rindolf> moritz_: nice.

[16:02] <moritz_> rindolf: no. It was about 30 lines of perl code

[16:02] <rindolf> moritz_: ah.

[16:03] <moritz_> something that painted a fractal in an unusual fashion

[16:03] <rindolf> moritz_: I once saw a really badly written Perl script on Freshmeat.

[16:03] <moritz_> rindolf: just one? ;-)

[16:04] <pbuetow> lol

[16:06] <rindolf> moritz_: it's unlikely to be yours.

[16:07] <moritz_> rindolf: I've freshmeated only one perl project of mine, and that has a Devel::Cover coverage of > 75% ;-)

[16:08] <rindolf> moritz_: ah, nice.

[16:08] <rindolf> moritz_: HTML-Widgets-NavMenu used to have a D::C coverage of 100%. :-)

[16:08] <rindolf> moritz_: it used to have 297 (300 - 3) individual assertions.

[16:09] <moritz_> rindolf: my assertions are just "... or confess(...)" which naturally decreases coverage

[16:09] <rindolf> moritz_: ah.

[16:09] <moritz_> Math::Expression::Evaluator (my first cpan module) has 100% coverage if you don'T count assertions

[16:10] *** eternaleye left

[17:08] <rindolf> pmurias: if they're responsible they'll still do a lot of work.

[17:09] *** justatheory joined

[17:18] *** sri_work joined
[17:18] <rindolf> pmurias: at my previous workplace, I sometimes cleared my mind by playing Sokoban and PySol.

[17:18] <rindolf> pmurias: they didn't like the fact that people went by and saw me playing.

[17:19] <rindolf> pmurias: because it didn't look like I was working.

[17:20] <pmurias> i'm not suprised by this

[17:21] *** eternaleye joined
[17:21] <rindolf> pmurias: I didn't play a lot.

[17:23] <pmurias> at least for me computer games just tire me more, and people tend to assume other people function similarly to them

[17:24] <pmurias> and solitare is the archetypical type waster

[17:26] <rindolf> pmurias: I sometimes felt at work that "I need to play a game" and then I played it for a while (< 30 minutes) and then I felt I could start working again.

[17:27] <rindolf> pmurias: for the record, I should say that they allowed browsing the Internet indefinitely.

[17:27] <rindolf> pmurias: and I could also talk on Freenode without a problem.

[17:27] <rindolf> In my current workplaces all ports are blocked except HTTP, HTTPS and SSH.

[17:28] <rindolf> So I use SSH port-forwarding to connect to Freenode.

[17:32] <pmurias> if you were allowed to whatever you please at work, you should be also allowed to do all your task fast and go home early

[17:37] <rindolf> pmurias: well, normally there are more tasks to be done.

[17:37] <rindolf> pmurias: I never had a case where I didn't have enough work to do.

[17:37] <rindolf> pmurias: not even when I was writing Perl.

[17:43] <pmurias> yes, but a person who can work with the same efficiency as you withought making brakes should be allowed to have a shorter workday

[18:37] <mncharity> TimToady: (14) stdstopper has a $ check, but if there is horizontal whitespace and/or a comment, that won't fire.

[18:41] <mncharity> re 14, hmm, or perhaps I'm supposed to be eating the ws elsewhere...  :/

[19:03] <mncharity> TimToady: (14) can be disregarded.  I'm still puzzling over the problem.  'sub f {} #x\n...' is failing in STD_red, unclear why.

[19:04] <mncharity> TimToady: (4 addendum 2) also re fatarrow using <ident> for the key, there's also a  ($var => 2) in t/blocks/sub_named_params.t .  valid?

[19:07] *** alanhaggai left
[19:14] <pmichaud> mncharity:  ($var => 2) is valid Perl 6, yes, but I think that it may get parsed by infix:=>, if there is such a beast.

[19:17] <pmichaud> don't see it in STD.pm, though.

[19:17] *** peepsalot joined
[19:17] <pmichaud> (that should be infix:sym<< => >>   of course, but I don't have the ability to type the french angles in my current system)

[19:17] <mncharity> ﻿pmichaud: right, thanks.  (4) may reduce to "there is no infix:[=>]" in STD.pm.  just a p5=> .

[19:18] <pmichaud> well, generalizing <key=ident> to be a full expression might be problematic, which is why I think it's likely to be a separate infix operator

[19:18] <pmichaud> and fatarrow handles the case of a bareword on the lhs

[19:18] <mncharity> re ﻿type the french angles, I cut and paste them. :)   hmm, I wonder what the "you have gnome+emacs, and wish to type X" real solution is supposed to be.

[19:19] <pmichaud> in vim I just do ctrl-k+<+< and it works great.

[19:19] <pmichaud> I used to have X11 set up so that right-alt+,+, would do the same

[19:20] <mncharity> that sounds like something for a "tips and tricks" page somewhere.

[19:21] <pmichaud> in vim, ":digraph" gives a list of the various special keyboard constructs (all introduced with ctrl-k)

[19:27] <mncharity> ctrl-x 8 <  is « .  nifty!  danke. :)

[19:27] <rindolf> mncharity: CTRL+K < <

[19:27] <rindolf> vim FTW!

[19:27] <rindolf> Or «

[19:28] <rindolf> Compose+<+< using the X11 compose key.

[19:28] <rindolf> I like Ctrl+K better than the compose.

[19:28] <rindolf> But I don't always type stuff in vim.

[19:31] <pmichaud> I used to have .xmodmap set up to assign my compose key to right-alt, but I can't find how I did that now :-(

[19:32] *** peepsalot left
[19:33] <mncharity> oh, I had to do something like that fairly recently... let's see...

[19:33] *** mj41 joined
[19:33] <pmichaud> I think    "keycode Alt_R = Multi_key"

[19:34] <pmichaud> nope, that doesn't work.  hrm.

[19:35] <pmichaud> aha

[19:35] <mncharity> xmodmap -e 'keycode  77 = Multi_key'

[19:35] <pmichaud> keysym Alt_R = Multi_key

[19:35] <pmichaud> works

[19:36] <mncharity> 77 is numlock, which is a very poor choice, but that's the idea

[19:36] <mncharity> ah, ok.  win.

[19:36] <pmichaud> now I can do Alt_R + < + <  to get «  and Alt_R + > + > to get »

[20:47] <pmurias> ruoso: why is the responder interface supplied to the Node seperatly instead of being taken from the invocant of the capture?

[23:36] <pmichaud> TimToady: S02 has:   $args = \3;   # same as "$args = \(3)"

[23:36] <pmichaud> I can't find where that's parsed in STD.pm

[23:38] <pmichaud> actually, S03 refers to prefix:<\>, but that appears to be missing.  So I'll assume that's what is intended.
