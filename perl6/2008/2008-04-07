[10:27] <rindolf> Hi all.

[10:28] <rindolf> Which language or technology inspired Perl 6's junctions ?

[10:28] <b_jonas> rindolf: a perl5 module

[10:28] <b_jonas> Quantum::Superpositions

[10:29] <rindolf> b_jonas: ah.

[10:29] <b_jonas> by Damian

[10:29] <rindolf> b_jonas: was it original to Q::S, or was Q::S inspired by something else?

[10:32] <rindolf> b_jonas: hmmm... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_6#Junctions

[10:32] <rindolf> Seems like an original concept to Perl 6.

[10:33] <b_jonas> I don't know

[10:33] <b_jonas> I think they're a bad idea the way they are

[14:36] <allbery_b> hm.  more that the evaluation model makes any "or" a junction (and any list a nondeterminacy monad a la Haskell)

[14:40] <diakopter> it's this perl ircbot framework

[14:40] <diakopter> it replaced svnbotl on #parrot

[14:42] <diakopter> because it polls/parses http://parrotvm.org/svn/parrot/rss instead of hitting the subversion repository (as well)

[16:20] <TimToady> allbery_b: it's more like icon relies on success/failure as indicated by unthrown exceptions to implement a kind of short-circuit or

[16:21] <TimToady> but the order of "or" is still strict, unlike junctions

[16:21] <TimToady> from my vague recollections...

[16:22] <TimToady> and it parses very differently from junctions

[16:23] <TimToady> my impression is that $a == 1 | 2 | 3 parses == tighter, but I could be misremembering that...

[16:24] <TimToady> it's been a *long* time since I looked at Icon...

[17:36] <cognominal_> TimToady: what is the convention to say the compiler, there is no inner eval, I won't use OUTER::, I will not keep reference around ....,   so the compiler can use non PMC registers when appropriate instead of shoving every lexical in a PMC

[18:17] <allbery_b> TimToady: it does, yes.  but the eval model isn't just about unthrown exceptions; *every* expression node is a restartable generator.  most of course trivially produce only one value then fail, but that every expression node i a generator makes unthrown exceptions and junction-like behavior possible

[20:13] <pmurias> @tell mncharity could use make a list of things you want to use Moose for (i'll try to figure out how to do them in pure p5)

[20:20] <stevan_> it doesnt make sense to use Moose if you are not taking advantage of the features

[20:23] <[particle]> moose!

[20:24] <PerlJam> It's too bad Joose wasn't named Goose as I had some good suessian stuff to use on it (from The Sleep Book)

[20:24] <pmurias> stevan_: emitting plain perl5 accesors is not a problem

[20:25] <jrockway> if someone writes a new object system for Groovy it could be called Goose

[20:26] <pmurias> sub foo {if (defined $_[1]) {$_[0]{'foo'} = $_[1] } else {$_[0]{'foo'} = $_[1]}}

[20:26] <PerlJam> that would be perfect in conjunction with Joose as I could talk about Mooses drinking moose joose and gooses drinking goose joose   :)

[20:31] <stevan_> pmurias: yes, and thats pretty much all you guys are using Moose for. its an awful lot of overhead for something as simple as that

[20:31] <stevan_> pmurias: oh, and also the constructors too

[20:31] <jrockway> there is that new XS accessor module now also
