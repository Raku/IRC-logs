[13:50] <masak> if I'm in package A::B, and I want to refer to A::B::C::D, but without having to mention A::B again, what do I write?

[13:52] *** cognominal left
[13:54] <moritz_> maybe something with $?PACKAGE ?

[13:57] *** cognominal joined
[13:58] <PerlJam> masak: an alias for A::B?

[13:59] *** agentzh joined
[13:59] <masak> PerlJam: a variable saying "the current package", preferably

[13:59] <masak> which you can concatenate subpackage names onto

[14:00] <moritz_> that's $?PACKAGE.

[14:00] <PerlJam> masak: then, I'm going with moritz_ on this one.

[14:00] <masak> but is $?PACKAGE::C::D really valid syntax?

[14:02] <moritz_> S02:1595

[14:02] <moritz_> it has $Foo::($bar)::baz as an example for interpolating into namespaces

[14:03] <moritz_> maybe ($?PACKAGE)::B::C or ::($?PACKAGE)::B::C are right then?

[14:04] <masak> moritz_: dz

[14:04] *** icwiener joined
[14:04] <moritz_> You may interpolate a string into a package or variable name using

[14:04] <moritz_> C<::($expr)> where you'd ordinarily put a package or variable name.

[14:04] <moritz_> S02:1673

[14:06] <masak> oh. I thought prefix :: was for type vars.

[14:06] *** BinGOs joined
[14:07] * moritz_ never really understood the relation between types and packages

[14:07] <moritz_> $::($?PACKAGE)::Subpackage::variable works

[14:07] <moritz_> S02:1687

[14:08] <masak> cool

[14:08] <masak> and if it happens to be a regex in a grammar? :)

[14:08] <moritz_> then the sigil is & instead of $

[14:09] <masak> right.

[14:29] <azawawi> how do i check P6 PODs (using something like podchecker)?

[14:30] <[particle]> there's no tool, currently

[14:30] <moritz_> unless Perl6::Pod provides one

[14:31] <moritz_> anyway, since the POD spec is pending indefinitely, it's not very wise to check against it

[14:31] <[particle]> there's a new draft in the works, i believe

[14:31] <azawawi> pending what?

[14:32] <[particle]> approval

[14:32] <moritz_> pending TheDamian having more time

[14:32] <azawawi> all i see in cpan is Perl6::Perldoc::Parser

[14:32] <[particle]> yeah, actually it's pending revisions for approval

[14:33] <moritz_> azawawi: that's what I meant, sorry

[14:33] <azawawi> moritz_: np

[14:36] <azawawi> so the problem is in the spec; not in the availabilility of tools checking for it like podchecker

[14:36] <moritz_> yes

[14:37] <[particle]> without spec, how do you write a tool?

[14:38] <moritz_> "educated guessing"

[14:38] <azawawi> make the tool define the spec ;-)

[14:38] <moritz_> that's exactly what we wanted to avoid for Perl 6 ;)

[14:38] <azawawi> i know ;-)

[14:39] <azawawi> but it makes things move forward a bit...

[14:40] <azawawi> but given the current S26 spec, a tool could be written to check for it.

[14:41] <moritz_> aye

[14:41] <[particle]> but that's ethereal, don't know if it still exists

[14:41] <azawawi> in p6 or p5?

[14:41] <moritz_> it worked, but was quite differently from what I'd expected

[14:41] <moritz_> azawawi: p6

[14:41] <[particle]> in p6

[14:42] <moritz_> but it didn't use rules to parse it :(

[14:42] <[particle]> but i can tell you, it *won't* be the official tool

[14:42] <[particle]> however, it works today, for some definition of "works".

[14:42] <moritz_> to some extend every Perl 6 compiler has to parse POD

[14:43] <moritz_> to provide the pod variables

[14:43] <azawawi> hmmm
