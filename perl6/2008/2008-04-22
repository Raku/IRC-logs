[02:00] <loggg> Think I got my question answered.  Parrot currently can't support library calls.  Oh well... painless calling of external libraries is _THE_ reason I'm interested in perl6.

[02:03] <loggg> I have one other.  What's the syntax for making such a call?  GL::glut::glutinit(argc, argv); ?  Maybe ::usr::lib::GL::glut::glutinit(argc, argv); ?

[11:57] <xinming> TimToady: In perl 6, will there be a unbless fuction built-in please?

[12:00] <xinming> TimToady: Since when we do bless $ref, $class, will make a object, will we be able to unbless the object and turn it into a nromal structure? In perl 5, there is an unbless implemention. But not built-in, Just hope if they can be built-in.

[14:35] <TimToady> xinming: the problem is that "everything is an object" in perl 6, so all you can do is turn it into a different object, like an Array. :)

[14:38] <syle> in perl6 for high concurrency servers we looking at threading implementation or events?

[14:39] <syle> http://www.usenix.org/events/hotos03/tech/full_papers/vonbehren/vonbehren_html/index.html

[14:39] <lambdabot> Title: HotOS IX &#151; Paper, http://tinyurl.com/gd5hv

[14:40] <TimToady> both, at different levels in your program

[14:40] <TimToady> sometimes it's easier to express what you want in threads, and sometimes in events

[14:41] <TimToady> see http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~lipeng/homepage/unify.html

[20:07] <rindolf> Hi all.

[20:07] <rindolf> TimToady: here?

[20:08] <rindolf> TimToady: have you looked at Arc yet? It's a very cool Lisp dialect, IMO.

[20:08] <rindolf> TimToady: but it has a lot to go until it's usable.

[20:13] <pmurias> rindolf: what cool features does arc have?

[20:13] <rindolf> pmurias: well, its primary selling point is that its very succinct.

[20:13] <rindolf> pmurias: also it has (+ for concat, addition, etc. like in Python.

[20:14] <rindolf> pmurias: which while not suitable for Perl, I feel it belongs in Lisp.

[20:14] <rindolf> pmurias: at the moment it's lacking a lot of stuff.

[20:15] <pmurias> + for concat sucks

[20:15] <rindolf> pmurias: and for example you can do (with (msg "Hello" id 1) (def myfunc () (+ msg id))) to define a global function which is a closure.

[20:16] <rindolf> pmurias: like { my $msg = "Hello" ; my $id = 0 ; sub { ... } } in Perl.

[20:16] <rindolf> pmurias: and it has macros.

[20:18] <pmurias> it's my $id = 1 in perl ;)

[20:19] *** ruoso joined
[20:20] <rindolf> pmurias: it's not tested.

[20:37] <pmurias> so it was python 2.3

[20:39] <ispy_> barf...

[20:39] <ispy_> sorry, excuse me...

[20:40] <pmurias> ispy_: shouldn't mention python here?

[20:41] <ispy_> haha...

[20:42] <ispy_> Nah... just messing.  I code in Python for work a bit.  Although, it's obvious what I prefer :)

[20:43] <wolverian> I don't get a barf reaction from python anymore, really

[20:43] <wolverian> either my standards have lowered or matlab just showed me what a truly terrifying language is like

[20:43] *** Grrrr left
[20:43] *** Grrrr joined
[20:44] <wolverian> only individual features make me barf nowadays :) (like the 'self.' spam in python)

[20:45] *** stevan_ left
[20:47] <ispy_> haha... That's true.  I've actually learned to like the language.  I just won't do anything serious with it unless I have too.

[20:47] <ispy_> For work I pretty much stick with Perl, C, Python... in that order.

[20:47] <ispy_> For pleasure, Perl 90% of the time unless the solution calls for C.

[20:49] <ispy_> My C skills could use a little sharpening too.

[20:50] *** chris2 joined
[20:50] <xinming> I ever wish to learn python after I think I "learnt" perl. Later, I was amazed by perl's ability of expression, and also with it's so flexible syntax, I never think about python again. ;-)

[20:50] <ispy_> One of the major reasons why I love Perl :)

[20:51] <ispy_> However, it's one of Perl's major downfalls too... but that's really subject to opinion and style.

[20:51] <ispy_> Obviously, *we* see it as a strength.  I know I do.

[20:54] <xinming> I think people who like perl is kind of person who like too many features from all programming language. ;-)

[20:56] <pmurias> it's better then missing the crucial one 

[20:57] <pmurias> c++ has a lot of features too, but I wouldn't say I like it

[20:58] <[particle]> i really liked c++ in 1994

[22:06] <wolverian> reading the lojban grammar makes me think of perl6.. 

[22:10] <Tene> I wrote most of a lojban grammar in Perl 6 rules.

[22:10] <Tene> not sure where it is anymore, though.

[22:10] <wolverian> how'd the longest token matching go?

[22:11] <Tene> I don't recall having problems with it.

[22:11] <Tene> Don't think I quite got finished translating it, though.

[22:11] <wolverian> mm

[22:11] <Tene> It was based off of the PEG

[22:14] <wolverian> oh, cool

[22:16] <wolverian> I want to see a graph of that :)

[22:27] *** Limbic_Region joined
[22:32] <Tene> Hmm... I wonder if I finished my script to generate pictures of rakudo's grammar.

[22:32] <Tene> I have a graph of rakudo's grammar and STD.pm, if you'd like.

[22:36] <wknight8111> i would actually like to see that

[22:36] <wknight8111> probably a pretty big graph

[22:36] <wolverian> sure

[22:36] <Tene> Bah, now I have to find them.  Jerk.

[22:38] <Tene> ... apparently my apartment is offline.

[22:39] <Tene> Nevermind, I guess.  I hope my roommate just tripped over the ethernet cable again or something equally easy to fix.
