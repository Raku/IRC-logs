[00:11] *** cmarcelo joined
[00:19] <mncharity> re kernel language... or maybe not?  some nodes like If could be calls to macros.  it might be nice to have a language form where "is parsed" macro applications have been converted to normal macro-with-arguments form, but otherwise nothing has changed.  so if can just be a macro prelude::if .

[00:20] <mncharity> so (almost?) everything would be a Call node, and the rest would be up to the compiler+runtime.

[00:30] <Juerd> "Close to correct". Is that where the next 80% begin?

[00:32] <mncharity> TimToady: woot.  have 42's match yaml.  curiously, if a lex/ directory doesn't exist, I instead get a segfault. :P

[00:32] <Tene> sub node { lazy { (:value(80), :next( node() ) ) } }

[00:33] <TimToady> mncharity: well, yes, and there's no provision for invalidating the lexer cache beyond rm lex/*  :)

[00:34] <TimToady> likewise yamlg5, but at least that one gets autocreated

[00:35] <mncharity> :)    rm redsix_cache/* too :)

[00:35] <TimToady> but I must shut my eyes for a bit.  that's why the checkin is only close to correct

[00:35] <TimToady> it seems to do longest token right on 0xdeadbeef and then fail the match

[00:35] <TimToady> probably because character classes are borken

[00:35] <mncharity> np.  just about end of hacking day for me.  hope to bang on things tomorrow.

[00:35] <TimToady> but nap &

[01:24] <mugwump> Rakudo was very briefly called perl6

[01:24] <wknight8111> the space is key

[17:02] <mncharity> Limbic_Region: [particle]: re 'anyone know how TimToad is coming along with the longest token matcher?', 'yes, it's mainly done'.  I believe that is incorrect.  Rather, it's a research project, very much a work in progress.  Eg, a recent landmark was the ability to parse "42".

[17:03] <mncharity> It has however recently become more active, switching from using pugs to using p5.

[17:06] <lambdabot> Title: Journal of chromatic (983)

[17:06] <[particle]> working != done, so i guess i screwed up

[17:08] <mncharity> Is anyone around who understands kp6 internals?  Specifically, a number of nodes in KindaPerl6/Ast.pm have fields with different types in their has() declaration, and their "method attribs" hash.  Eg, Lit::Object's @.fields vs %.fields, and Decl's $.var vs @.var.  Anyone have any idea what is going on?

[17:08] <mncharity> (roundtrip-tests++)

[17:10] <mncharity> Limbic_Region: [particle]: ah, ok.  perhaps 'longest-token autolexer' vs 'STD5 using longest-token autolexer'?  the first working, the second being worked on?

[17:10] <mncharity> @seen fglock

[17:10] <lambdabot> I haven't seen fglock.

[17:11] <TimToady> the autolexer is pretty much working well, but the parser still has a number of kinks to work out.  I may be running into a yaml bug or two as well.

[17:12] <TimToady> there are large parts of STD that nobody has ever run on any platform, so of course there are bugs and thinkos

[17:13] <TimToady> the leveraging thing here is that many of them can be fixed all at once by tweaking the p6-to-p5 translation when there is systemantic error

[17:13] <TimToady> such as feeding the wrong arguments to some primitive

[17:13] <TimToady> there are also still some spots where the parser feeds the wrong information to the autolexer

[17:14] <TimToady> these show up as matching OOPS instead of the null string because TRE coredumps when it tries to match the null string

[17:15] <TimToady> also, still haven't quite finished the transformation of a* b to incorporate b's longest tokens into the implicit alternation of (a|) implied by *

[17:16] <TimToady> what does seem quite solid is the mechanism for determining which parts of the DFA matched, and what fate that maps to

[17:17] <TimToady> and using that fate to call into recursive descent knowing which alternatives to take

[17:20] <TimToady>  but basically, yes, finishing the autolexer does not imply that STD5 works very well

[17:21] <TimToady> it does imply that we can make it blow up much more quicly and consistently though :)

[17:21] <[particle]> that's important.

[17:21] <mncharity> lol

[17:21] <TimToady> yes, when pugs was taking 10 minutes to compile one autolexer, it was very hard to get into a debuggin rhythm

[17:22] <mncharity> also means translating the autolexer into p6 is becoming plausible... :)

[17:22] <TimToady> well, I had a version in p6, which the p5 version is a translation of

[17:22] <TimToady> so translating back won't be terribly difficult

[17:24] <TimToady> the bigger problem for someone wanting to do autolexing in a parser is that they have to be able to call pass control back and forth between the parser and the autolexer in much the same way that STD5.pm and Cursor5.pm do

[17:24] <TimToady> so I don't now how much work it would be to retrofit, say, PGE with it

[17:24] <[particle]> pge uses coroutines now

[17:24] <TimToady> especially since PGE doesn't even use methods yet

[17:25] <TimToady> yes, philosophically it's quite different from the lazy gather/take approach I used

[17:26] <TimToady> especially since the cursor objects are considered immutable

[17:26] <TimToady> and mutable match objects are constructed only when needed for the user's point of view

[17:26] <[particle]> yes, it's quite different.

[17:26] <[particle]> i'm sure patrick will come up with something brilliant, as usual.

[17:27] <TimToady> in all likelihood

[17:33] *** justatheory joined
[17:34] <TimToady> looking at STD5's expansion of even very simple regexen, it's really amazing that it runs as fast as it does

[17:34] <TimToady> and, of course, debugging it is a complete brain pretzel

[17:35] <TimToady> I've even had to resort to "perl -d" at times, which is a rarity for me :)

[17:35] <[particle]> Cursor.pm is easier to read than .l, for sure

[17:35] <TimToady> (despite having written the debugger myself in the first place)

[17:35] <[particle]> heh.

[17:35] *** blindfish joined

[17:36] <TimToady> I should probably have been tweaking Cursor.pm as I discover thinkos in Cursor5.pm, but I haven't been--didn't occur to me

[17:36] <[particle]> looks like i need to fix my pugs dev env to include perl 5.01

[17:36] <TimToady> I'll have to review the checkin logs at some point on Cursor5.pm, I guess

[17:37] <TimToady> I use // freely

[17:37] <TimToady> so late 5.9 would probably work too :)

[17:37] <[particle]> easy enough, just change one config file and fire up another terminal

[17:38] <TimToady> now all I have to do is rewrite Perl 5 to use Cursor objects :)

[17:39] <TimToady> and then p5 can have regexen that automatically translate dfa-able prefixes to dfa matching :)

[17:39] <TimToady> that conveniently say OOPS where it won't work.  :)

[17:44] <TimToady> error message is wrong, should say yamlg5 instead of tmpyaml

[17:45] <TimToady> you'll also need to create a lex/ dir

[17:45] <TimToady> I don't think it does that like it does yamlg5

[17:46] <[particle]> i'll look into it

[17:49] <[particle]> when is the lex/ dir needed? the command seems to have succeeded

[17:50] <TimToady> lex is used when you run STD5

[17:50] <TimToady> well, I don't run STD5 directly, I run "try" that sez "use STD5;"

[17:51] <TimToady> but it starts using lex/ as soon as you call into any rule in the parser

[17:51] <[particle]> wow, this is some experiment in nested map!

[17:52] <TimToady> I will paste a copy of my "try"

[20:36] <buchetc> I've installed libghc6-cabal-devel, but no programm called cabal

[20:36] <gwern> see what ghc-pkg list|grep Cabal gives you

[20:37] <wolverian> (there isn't supposed to be a cabal binary, yet.)

[20:37] <buchetc> Cabal-1.1.3, Cabal-1.1.6.2, base-2.1.1, binary-0.3, filepath-1.0,

[20:38] <gwern> hm. 1.1.  I guess you're not using ghc 6.8.x?

[20:39] <gwern> well, try cd'ing to thirdparty/hssyck and doing the cabal installation by hand

[20:39] <gwern> it might be the scripts fault

[20:39] <buchetc> no, 6.6.1 but with this version I was able to build pugs 3 days ago

[20:39] <gwern> yes, well, that's probably my fault

[20:40] * gwern did a lot of messing around with hssyck and company recently

[20:42] <buchetc> manual installation means calling somthing like __~/dev/pugs/third-party/HsSyck$ ./Setup.hs build__

[21:08] <buchetc> Yeah, problem seems to be solved. I've download older version HsSyck-0.4 and are now able to run ./Setup.hs configure && build

[21:08] <buchetc> gwern: many thx

[21:11] <gwern> buchetc: you should've just been able to do the 'runhaskell Setup configure

[21:15] <gwern> could you paste line 14?

[21:15] <spinclad> License:             OtherLicense

[21:16] <gwern> or just hpaste the whole thing, I wonder if we're looking at the same thing sometimes

[21:16] <gwern> oh. hm/ you know, audry had that commented out.

[21:16] <spinclad> svn r19980

[21:16] <gwern> I wonder if maybe that constant was only added in 1.2?

[21:16] <gwern> try just commenting that out. cabal might complain, but it won';t be an error

[21:17] <spinclad> will do

[21:17] <buchetc> I'm now stuck with pugs-hsregex. Similar message ": pugs-hsregex.cabal:13: 'Executable' stanza starting with field 'build-type"

[21:17] <gwern> build-type isn't an important field either, you can cm it

[21:19] <buchetc> hmmm... Setup: pugs-hsregex.cabal:13: 'Executable' stanza starting with field 'cabal-version'

[21:23] <buchetc> * away because my childs are crying &

[21:23] <spinclad> if i leave any field uncommented after the Description: field, it complains about "'Executable' stanza starting with field <whatever>"

[21:24] <spinclad> if i comment them all out, it complains about various things those fields would have told it.

[21:25] <gwern> weird. I'd say personally just upgrade to cabal 1.2.3.0. I think it's backwards compatible with 6.6.2

[21:25] <spinclad> (6.6.1 here)

[21:26] <gwern> oh. maybe it too

[21:26] <spinclad> i'd consider upgrading to 6.8.2, but i'd like to make it work again with 6.6.1 if possible

[21:27] <gwern> pugs is kind of broken with 6.8.2. I followed the example diff, but never managed to make it work

[21:27] <spinclad> ok, GHC newbie:  how to upgrade?

[21:27] <spinclad> (cabal, that is)

[21:28] <gwern> offhand, I'd visit http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/Cabal-1.2.3.0

[21:28] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/2eey3b

[21:28] <spinclad> will do 

[21:33] <spinclad> meanwhile i see that the License: field used to be BSD3, i'll try that now.

[21:33] <gwern> it's not actually BSD3, of course, but MIT

[21:33] <spinclad> right, it was always a lie

[21:39] *** justatheory joined
[21:41] <spinclad> hm.  back to complaining about the 'license' field itself, of course.

[21:43] <spinclad> aha!  older cabal doesn't like blank lines; they seem to mark beginning of an 'executable' stanza.  commenting out...

[21:49] <spinclad> and... "Setup.hs: cannot satisfy dependency bytestring>=0.9.0.1" -- i seem to lack bytestring entirely (ghc-pkg list doesn't mention it)

[21:50] <spinclad> a 6.8.x thing?

[21:51] <buchetc> I've got the same result...

[21:51] <spinclad> looks to me i could either downgrade HsSyck or upgrade ghc

[21:52] <gwern> spinclad: or update bytestring. I had to add in that version constraint because the bytestring api changed

[21:53] <gwern> and I obviously had update the code to use the new api

[21:53] <gwern> so using an older bytestring would break

[21:54] *** blindfish left
[21:55] <spinclad> i don't seem to have it at all at 6.6.1; is it a new dependency?

[21:56] <buchetc> so I will going to install ghc 6.8.1 ( and not reinstall ubuntu :)

[21:56] <gwern> bytestring was bundled in as part of the default install, iirc. 6.8.x kicked it out as a separate library, along with a bunch of other stuff

[21:57] <spinclad> ok, i'll fetch it in then.

[22:26] <pmichaud> in Perl 6, is "1E6" a valid shortcut for 1_000_000 ?   Or does it have to be written "1.0E6"?  STD.pm seems to indicate the latter.
