[00:22] <mib_1864dswq> I am experimenting with getting .perl to work on the hashes now.  What I want to do is call .perl() on each value in the hash. 

[00:22] *** do joined
[00:23] <mib_1864dswq> When I try to do this with val.'perl'(), I am getting the error: Method 'perl' not found for invocant of class 'ResizablePMCArray'

[00:23] *** do is now known as do_aki

[00:24] <mib_1864dswq> How do I get access to the actual object in that value so that I can call the .perl method.  I am currently testing a hash of hashes when I see this, but I expect I would see it for any complicated structure

[09:20] <pmurias> creating smop data structures from C is hairy ;)

[09:24] *** wknight8111 joined
[09:36] <masak> pmurias: why are you doing that?

[09:40] <pmurias> playing around now, hoping to generate smop nodes from elf soon

[09:40] <pmurias> do you now of better way to feed smop code?

[09:40] <pmurias> * a better

[09:43] <masak> not really

[09:43] <masak> just curious about what you were doing

[09:44] <masak> what's smop again? a meta-model?

[09:44] <pmurias> masak: it's an object model + a runloop

[09:45] <pmurias> http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?smop

[09:45] <lambdabot> Title: SMOP / Perl 6

[09:45] <masak> thx

[09:46] <pmurias> the runloop sucks but it is designed to be replaceable but i like the object format

[09:46] *** meteorjay left
[09:47] <masak> looks interesting

[09:51] *** do_aki left
[09:52] <pmurias> it is interesting how fast could smop possibly run(with a jit and other things), compared to parrot

[09:52] <pmurias> as smop has a cleaner but less speed-oriented architecture

[09:57] <masak> what version has smop reached?

[09:58] <pmurias> 0.2.1 i guess

[10:01] *** [particle1 joined
[10:02] <masak> so, pre-roadmap versioning

[10:03] <pmurias> the completed parts of the roadmap are in the changelog

[12:18] <Juerd> feather1 was out of memory.

[12:19] <moritz_> was it a leaking bot again?

[12:19] <Juerd> I have no idea.

[12:21] <Juerd> http://feather.perl6.nl/~juerd/feather1.perl6.nl-memory-day.png

[12:22] <Juerd> moritz_: The problem is, there's not much you can do once the box hangs

[12:22] <Juerd> moritz_: Feather isn't actively monitored by me. (And never will.)

[12:23] <moritz_> so we'd need logging on a per-process basis, which is probably not worth the trouble

[12:23] <Juerd> Well, what we need most is people with tuits - of all kinds.

[12:24] <Juerd> It's easy to monitor a machine for growing processes, but I'm not going to do it because intervening would mean more work for me.

[12:24] <Juerd> Though in this case the number of processes also went up, by about a hundred.

[12:26] *** Lorn_ joined
[12:26] <moritz_> ah well, I guess that will happen from time to time

[12:28] <Juerd> I estimate once per few months.

[12:28] <Juerd> Maybe once a month on average

[12:29] <Juerd> It tends to happen a few times in a row :D

[18:49] <geezusfreeek> hey guys. i was reading http://notes-on-haskell.blogspot.com/2008/05/static-vs-dynamic-languages.html, which says "[Hindley-Milner type inference is] such a good idea, that it's slowly making its way into new programming languages like Perl 6 [...]"

[18:49] <lambdabot> Title: Notes on Haskell: Static vs. Dynamic Languages, http://tinyurl.com/4ckvy4

[18:49] <geezusfreeek> could anybody provide some insight into this for me? i can't seem to find anything relating hindley-milner inference to perl 6 anywhere

[18:49] <geezusfreeek> woah, lambdabot is here!

[18:51] <moritz_> Perl 6 has optionally typing

[18:51] <moritz_> optionally *static* typing, that is

[18:51] <moritz_> I haven't heard of type inference in Perl 6 so far

[18:52] <moritz_> if something doesn't have a type declaration you won't get a compile time type error

[18:52] <moritz_> at least that's not guaranteed

[18:52] <geezusfreeek> hmm, okay

[18:52] <Eevee> anyone running debian or ubuntu or other derivative, your keys are broken: http://isc.sans.org/diary.html

[18:53] <moritz_> Eevee: you're late ;)

[18:54] <moritz_> Eevee: it made the news yesterday

[18:54] <Eevee> moritz_: well thanks for telling *me*  :P  my desktop has sshd with public key auth, this is the sort of thing I would like to know about

[18:54] <moritz_> actually anybody who maintains an openssh server and used DSA should consider making new keys

[18:55] <moritz_> Eevee: I told Juerd yesterday (and that I updated feather), and posted the link in #p5p and #perlde (both on irc.perl.org)

[18:55] <Eevee> "luckily" my webserver is just password.  but I should probably regen the certs I use for email

[18:55] <moritz_> so I didn't want to spam *all* channels that I'm in ;)

[18:56] <Eevee> see I'm not in either of those!

[18:57] <Eevee> oh wow

[18:57] <Eevee> ubuntu's security update PROMPTS me to regen my keys for me

[18:57] <Eevee> ubuntu++

[18:59] <moritz_> so does debians ;)

[18:59] <moritz_> and installs a blacklist of insecure keys

[18:59] <Eevee> yeah, patching server now and I see openssh-blacklist being installed

[19:00] <Eevee> scary.  possibly also a testament to OSS how fast this has been patched in a way that will fix everything for me

[19:00] <geezusfreeek> @karma ubuntu

[19:00] <lambdabot> ubuntu has a karma of 1

[19:00] <Eevee> haha, it's a start

[19:01] <moritz_> @karma debian

[19:01] <lambdabot> debian has a karma of -1

[19:01] <geezusfreeek> lol

[19:01] <Eevee> ha

[19:01] <moritz_> uuh

[19:01] <moritz_> debian++ # fixing its stuff and eating its own dog food
