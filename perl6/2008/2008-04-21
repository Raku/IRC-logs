[02:40] <syle> perl6 have threads?

[02:46] *** wtgee left
[02:46] <allbery_b> intended to, yes.  implementations may not do so as yet, but the language spec includes things which are specifically targeting not just threads in general but automatic threading

[02:50] <allbery_b> (clarifying:  threads are not required, but there are language features which implementations are encouraged to treat as requests for automatic threading)

[20:55] <loggg> I want to call C library functions (specifically, OpenGL) from perl 6.  Is this functionality working yet?  How are these calls made?

[20:56] <Tene> loggg: OpenGL support was just recently added to Parrot.

[20:57] <rindolf> Tene: heh, nice.

[21:08] *** meppl joined
[21:09] <SamB> why the heck does it need opengl support???

[21:10] *** justatheory left
[21:15] <SubStack> why not?

[21:16] <SamB> well, I mean, couldn't opengl bindings exist independantly of either parrot or opengl?

[21:47] *** rindolf left
[21:47] <SamB> Tene: eh???

[21:47] <SamB> that sounds rather nasty

[21:47] <Patterner> like h2ph?
