[14:48] <masak> xshelf: could you paste the build output on http://sial.org/pbot/perl6?

[14:48] <masak> xshelf: also, we're talking about Rakudo here, right?

[14:49] <pasteling> "xshelf" at 59.92.171.84 pasted "build failure" (7 lines, 390B) at http://sial.org/pbot/31979

[14:49] <xshelf> done: http://sial.org/pbot/31979

[14:50] *** zamolxes left
[14:51] <masak> xshelf: I'd recommend sending a bug report to [email@hidden.address] -- include the build failure and that you're running Windows XP.

[14:51] <masak> also, you could ask over on #parrot at irc.perl.org -- but it's fairly quiet there right now

[14:51] <masak> busier on weekdays.

[14:51] <xshelf> masak: Should I register to send a bug report?

[14:52] <masak> xshelf: nah, just send it

[14:52] <xshelf> good, will do it

[14:52] <masak> xshelf++

[14:52] <xshelf> How far is perl6 for being usable (with true class support)

[14:53] <masak> xshelf: I use classes in rakudo. it's not all there yet, but fairly usable already.

[14:53] <masak> see jonathan's recent blog posts for an idea of what's implemented and what isn't

[14:54] <masak> http://use.perl.org/~JonathanWorthington/journal/

[14:54] <xshelf> thanks for the link, I am new here

[14:54] <xshelf> I went through this confusion of switching to python or stick to perl

[14:55] <masak> xshelf: you don't have to choose. it's not monogamy, it's programming languages.

[14:55] <xshelf> The only feature that I missed from python was ability to create classes, when I realized perl6 will have it. I decided to stick to perl

[14:55] <masak> "the ability to create classes"?

[14:56] <xshelf> I mean not through the bless and related stuff

[14:56] <masak> ...but...?

[14:56] <xshelf> I need to be able to create objects (with data and functions)

[14:56] <masak> I'm sorry, but Python does that for you.

[14:57] <masak> not saying you should prefer it to Perl, just clearing out the FUD

[14:57] <xshelf> yes, I like perl as I have worked with it and do not have to learn a new syntax

[14:57] <masak> well, you do :)

[14:58] <masak> Perl 6 is not all the same syntax

[14:58] <masak> many new things

[14:58] <xshelf> psychologically, it still feels like a big upgrade rather than a new language

[14:59] <masak> yes.

[15:01] <xshelf> At work, it has been decided all scripts officially developed and that goes to customers (with official stamp) has to be in PERL. We were getting in to a real concoction of scripts

[15:02] <masak> http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/docs/Perl6/Perl5/Differences.pod

[15:03] <masak> xshelf: I hope you don't write it "PERL" with all capitals :)

[15:03] * moritz_ doesn't recommend Perl 6 for production yet

[15:03] <masak> http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=510594

[15:03] <moritz_> at least not with the currently available compilers

[15:04] <masak> xshelf: moritz_ is right. if it's for your $work you're building Perl 6, try out the new Perl 5.10.0 instead. it's pretty cool, and much more stable.

[15:05] <xshelf> Perl is what I see (not all caps) but at times I get confused as it is also an acronym

[15:05] <xshelf> I am using Perl 5.10

[15:05] <masak> xshelf: it is also an acronym, but not primarily.

[15:06] <xshelf> ok, thanks for the clarification

[15:06] <moritz_> the various acronymical meanings were added later

[15:06] <masak> a "backronym"

[15:06] <moritz_> like "Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister"

[15:07] <moritz_> "Polymorphic existential recursive lambda"

[15:07] <moritz_> you name it ;)

[15:07] <xshelf> talking about acronyms, I like GNU the best

[15:07] <xshelf> for the 'bacronyms', Emacs has it own share

[15:07] <moritz_> I know

[15:08] <moritz_> there's a whole file with them in the emacs debian package ;)

[15:08] <masak> we haven't backronymed 'november' yet :)

[15:08] <xshelf> true

[15:09] <xshelf> masak: I posted a bug report

[15:09] <moritz_> Not Only Very Early, But Equally Radical (new wiki)

[15:09] <masak> :)

[15:09] <xshelf> 'm' missing

[15:09] <masak> you missed an "M", yes

[15:10] <moritz_> m... maintainable?

[15:10] <masak> and "early" is in the eye of the beholder -- the challenge was put out in 2006 :)

[15:10] <masak> moritz_: we can only hope :)

[15:10] <moritz_> an early Perl 6 application

[15:11] <xshelf> i will just hope and pray that perl6 comes out on time

[15:12] * moritz_ not only hopes, but also works towards that goal

[15:12] <xshelf> not sure how I can contribute with my skill set

[15:13] <moritz_> the easiest entry is by writing tests

[15:13] <masak> xshelf: have you looked at the test suite?

[15:14] *** edpratomo joined
[15:14] <xshelf> ok, I will first sort out the build. I wanted to play with svk, found perl6 is hosted on svk and started getting into pulling it and building it for fun. It is now becoming a serious interest now

[15:14] <xshelf> i am just ~1week old to perl6

[15:15] <moritz_> ;)

[15:15] <xshelf> I brought the book 'Perl6 and Parrot', started reading it

[15:15] <moritz_> http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-5-to-6/ if you haven't already seen it

[15:15] <xshelf> my 1 month goal is to read that book

[15:15] <moritz_> the book is good, but rather outdated wrt perl 6

[15:16] <xshelf> the only one available... I am used to reading books in print :-(

[15:17] <moritz_> that's definitely something sombody[tm] should do: write an up-to-date book about Perl 6

[15:18] <moritz_> but it seems that most people are either not enough interested, or don't understand the language well enough, or don't have enough time, or care more about the implementation

[15:19] <xshelf> would using strawberry perl help so that might use GCC to build perl6/parrot

[15:20] <moritz_> dunno, it's been years that I used windows voluntarily

[15:21] <xshelf> anyone working on windows port of parrot/perl6 here?

[15:22] <xshelf> i spend most time on windows (as I spend most of my time at work)

[15:22] <xshelf> no option!

[15:23] <moritz_> xshelf: you'll have much more success in #parrot (on irc.perl.org), I know jonathan builds parrot on windows

[15:23] <moritz_> and particle

[15:23] <xshelf> moritz_: great, I will hang out on that channel too

[15:25] <xshelf> is it #parrot?

[15:25] <xshelf> no one was there...

[15:25] <masak> xshelf: yes, but not on this server.

[15:26] <xshelf> oh!

[15:26] <masak> irc.perl.org

[15:26] <xshelf> thanks, I would have waited till infinity!

[15:26] <edpratomo> moritz_: thank you for the perl5-to-6 series

[15:27] <moritz_> edpratomo: you're welcome

[15:27] <edpratomo> what is the status of continuation and coroutine spec in perl6?

[15:28] <moritz_> coroutines are done with gather/take

[15:28] <moritz_> there's no explicit yield()

[15:28] <edpratomo> ah.. which synopses is it in?

[15:29] <edpratomo> i was looking in s17.. looks like the wrong place

[15:29] <moritz_> S04 iirc

[15:30] <moritz_> http://perlcabal.org/syn/S04.html#The_gather_statement

[18:16] <ujwalic> is it same for pugs code too

[18:27] <moritz_> don't think so

[18:28] <moritz_> you can use util/smartlinks.pl to convert some of the POD to html

[20:16] <chris2> hi. i thought i read a kwiki-like format is considered as alternative to pod for perl 6 docs, but i can't find it anymore. who knows the proposal?

[20:17] <moritz_> I think it has been deprecated by S26

[20:17] <moritz_> but the Perl6::Perl5::Differences document still describes the old kwiki style

[20:17] <chris2> oh, okay

[20:18] <chris2> kwid!

[20:18] <moritz_> right

[20:18] <chris2> that's the key phrase i was looking for, thanks

[20:18] <moritz_> ;)

[20:21] <chris2> what was the rationale for reverting that?

[20:22] <moritz_> I don't think kwid can reference code

[20:22] <moritz_> there's also no really good reason to change, IMHO

[20:23] <chris2> matter of taste ;)
