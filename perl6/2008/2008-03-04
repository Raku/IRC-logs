[06:03] <katie_d> Are there any good sites that map out the inner workings of Parrot, analogous to Gisle Aas' "Perlguts Illustrated" ? I'd like to start reading the Parrot sources, but my knowledge of C isn't that great, and it would be helpful to have a "map" to help me find my way around...

[06:05] <PerlJam> katie_d: if you download parrot there's lots of info in the docs directory.

[06:06] <katie_d> Perljam: OK, sorry about that. I'm currently building subversion, so I haven't had a chance to browse through it yet. I'll look into that when it's done. Thanks :)

[06:07] <PerlJam> katie_d: there's also some dead-tree info in the book "Parrot and Perl 6 Essentials"

[06:07] <PerlJam> but dead-trees are quickly outdated.

[06:07] <PerlJam> oops, it's called "PErl 6 and Parrot Essentials"

[06:07] <PerlJam> (just looked over on my book shelf)

[06:08] <katie_d> Yes, there is an online edition now I believe. At least part of it. I'm not sure if it's the whole book though.

[06:10] <PerlJam> katie_d: If you'd like to learn PIR and such, I've got a few articles in The Perl Review, chromatic has a few articles in The Linux Journal (I think)

[06:11] <PerlJam> oh, it's just "Linux Magazine"

[06:12] <katie_d> OK, thanks. I'll look into those. Here is the link to the free online copy of P6/Parrot essentials btw. It is a work in progress, but they are indeed putting it up for free: http://dev.pugscode.org/browser/docs/tutorial

[06:12] <lambdabot> Title: /docs/tutorial - Pugs - Trac

[06:14] <PerlJam> well, that's more perl6y than parroty

[06:17] <katie_d> Yes. It looks like the later parts of the book, regarding parrot's architecture, haven't been added in yet (if they are ever going to be)

[06:19] <PerlJam> http://www.parrotcode.org/docs/ is what you're looking for I think

[06:19] <lambdabot> Title: Parrot Documentation - parrotcode

[06:20] <PerlJam> But there is some disconnect between the docs in the parrot source tree and the docs on the website so if you want the most up to date info, look at the parrot source tree

[06:20] *** wknight8111 left
[06:22] <katie_d> Thanks for the link. I just finished building SVN a few minutes ago and have been looking through /docs -- very interesting stuff. Hopefully in a few months, I'll be able to start helping out :)

[06:23] <PerlJam> why a few months?  Jump in now :)

[06:26] <katie_d> PerlJam: I don't know C very well, and I've never worked on any big projects. Up to this point, I've only written 1000-3000 line scripts in Perl. I've working through K&R and "Practical C", but don't have any real world experience. So it will be a while before I'm ready to do anything as difficult as Parrot.

[06:27] <katie_d> This is going to be my first attempt at helping out with a big open source project, so I'll probably need a few months of learning :)

[06:28] <PerlJam> Experience is the best teacher.  Find something to do and just do it so that even your learning can contribute meaningfully  :)

[06:28] <PerlJam> there are lots of niches in Parrot for people of various skill levels.

[15:45] <gbacon> see my commit message

[15:46] <gbacon> I'm running ghc-6.8.2

[15:46] <gbacon> and Cabal-1.3.3

[15:46] <mncharity> nothingmuch: re 'static typing for parent/child rels', is the problem that they don't have union types?

[15:46] <mncharity> re, ghc, ah, ok.  let's see...

[15:48] <gbacon> it ought to work with older versions of Cabal, but you know how that goes

[15:49] <gbacon> and probably older versions of ghc too

[15:49] <gbacon> I wonder whether 6.8.2 got stricter about wobbly types

[15:51] *** pmurias joined

[15:57] <gbacon> mncharity: did you try the build?

[15:58] <gbacon> I doubt that 1.3.3 is strictly required

[16:36] <mncharity> weeee.  ok.  so the question is why has this become wobbly.  left over wobbliness seems to be "the type system shrugged here".  so did something else break, or become weaker, creating the ambiguity?  did this?  or did the type inferencer get weaker?

[16:37] <mncharity> http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/src/Pugs/AST/Internals/Instances.hs

[16:38] <[particle]> #ghc may have answers we don't

[16:38] <gbacon> no, it's a wobbly type because the typechecker is conservative

[16:39] <gbacon> there are ambiguous cases that can arrive, so it needs type annotations

[16:39] <mncharity> (aside, I saw an experimental language once which was 2D, inside of emacs - you would write out denotational semantics, complete with lines of "---------", just as if it were a paper.  I wonder if we could do something similar in p6 for typing rules:)

[16:40] <mncharity> oh, and it would run of course. (the language)

[16:41] <mncharity> I don't suppose the needed type annotations are... pause... obvious?

[16:41] <mncharity> silly question.  ok.

[16:41] <gbacon> well, it already has an annotation

[20:59] <PerlJam> mugwump: did the last bit go quicker than the first bit?  It seems like just the other day you were happy to be at 5.005 or whatever.

[20:59] <mugwump> Well I had to write an importer for the perforce era of changes

[21:00] <mugwump> Once I got all the conversion issues through to about Change 1647 (perl 5.005) sorted, there were very few bugs after that

[21:00] <PerlJam> oh, I forgot about that.

[21:00] <mncharity> Moose, "16 months ago"?  what exactly is the projects/ directory?

[21:01] <mugwump> oh, sorry, there is a lot of old stale cruft there

[21:01] <mugwump> that was a little proof of concept conversion

[21:01] <mncharity> np, just curious.

[21:01] <mugwump> I took 814kB of CPAN tarballs, a 4MB SVN repository for Moose and crammed them into a 450kB packfile

[21:02] <mncharity> re "perforce era of changes", ah, so it was a "hairy data conversion" exercise, not just a "painful broken tools system assembly" exercise.

[21:02] <mncharity> eep

[21:03] <mncharity> um, how?

[21:04] <mncharity> oh, the svn wasn't compressed.  even with some file commonality, the 2x compression improvement is more than i'd have guessed.

[21:04] <mugwump> the svn is included in that

[21:04] <mugwump> the STEVAN-trunk head has the svn history

[21:06] <stevan_> wait,.. what did I do?

[21:06] <mncharity> lol

[21:07] <[particle]> stevan_: check your trunk

[21:07] <mncharity> we had p6 all finished, by there was a bug in one of your commits, so it's all gone.  mugwump is trying to recover it, but, not much hope.

[21:08] <mncharity> *but

[21:08] <PerlJam> it's going to be sad christmas this year then  

[21:08] <PerlJam> think of all the children!

[21:08] <stevan_> mncharity: yes, its all part of my plan to keep p6 as just vaporware so people will use Moose

[21:08] <mncharity> lol :)

[21:08] <stevan_> [particle]: what trunk ?

[21:09] <mncharity> re sad christmas, that does restore focus, doesn't it.  ok.  almost end of day Mar 4.  what's the right development path...

[21:09] <mncharity>  /me wonders if there is vocabulary for "right way to push through a pathless jungle".

[21:10] <stevan_> slash and burn?

[21:10] * PerlJam prefers a machete, but that's only for personal use

[21:10] <PerlJam> If we're pushing more people, we need more machetes  :)

[21:11] <mncharity> re r20058, building...

[21:11] *** gbacon left
[21:12] <mncharity> re "slash and burn?", interesting - I came across the concept of "charing"(sp?) a day or two ago.  Instead of slashing down and burning the pile, you instead char the trees away.  so most of the carbon hangs around, improving the soil, rather than blowing away.

[21:12] *** gbacon joined
[21:14] <mncharity> but anyway...

[21:15] <mncharity> ()  repackage pmurias's kp6 p5 backend as p5 class with an api, so it can be driven by other ast's... eh, the api is likely most of the weight.. :/

[21:16] <mncharity> hi stevan_ :)  how goes Moose land?

[21:16] <mncharity> I notice the ANTLR folks  have the convention of taking picturees of themselves holding their hands up like antlers.  an artistic opportunity for Moosen?

[21:17] <stevan_> :)

[21:18] <stevan_> mncharity: Mooseland is sell, we need to do a big documentation push though, too many new features without docs :)

[21:21] *** peeps[work] joined
[21:31] <mncharity> ooh, "many new features"?  a literature pointer or summary?

[21:32] <mncharity> gbacon: ended with src/Main.hs:17:7: Could not find module `Pugs':, which sounds like you described.

[21:32] <jrockway> everyone took antler pictures at YAPC::NA 2006 for some reason

[21:33] <gbacon> mncharity: right, and if you try to help it out with -isrc, it tries to rebuild the whole stinkin' thing

[21:33] <mncharity> but lots of happy compilation! :)  progress!

[21:55] <mncharity> TimToady: disregarding debugability, do you have any feel for whether/how well STD.pm would work if run on a completely backtracking engine?  ie, everything is interpreted as a rule or regex, and even the operator precedence parser will back out of things.  ie, is the non-backtracking a requirement for correct parse, or simply efficiency?

[21:58] *** thoughtpolice left
[21:58] <gbacon> cool, linking!

[21:58] <gbacon> not cool: internal urp

[21:59] <mncharity> eg, C parser have the parser->lexer feedback hack to distinguish identifiers from typenames, but if your willing to backtrack, you don't need it.  I'm wondering if STD might simplify, if parts of it could be ignored, if one was willing to backtrack extensively.

[21:59] * mncharity wonders what an "urp" is, goes to see...

[22:02] *** qmole left
[22:04] <mncharity> Fortunately there's no Bool in ext/Math-Basic/lib/Math/Basic.pm, so it's "not my fault".  There are some Bool's in Prelude, but the file hasn't been changed in half a year.

[22:07] <gbacon> yeah, and it's worrisome that Bool is occurs very early in the prelude

[22:07] <gbacon> s/is occurs/occurs/

[22:08] *** katie_d_ is now known as katie_d

[22:10] <mncharity> oh, that's weird.

[22:10] *** cosimo_ left
[22:11] <mncharity> I svn up'ed to 20060, and rather than make clean, first just tried make.  That got me to Bool.  then did a make clean; perl Makefile.PL; make, which instead failed with

[22:11] <mncharity> ghc-6.8.2: unknown package: Pugs

[22:11] *** rindolf left
[22:13] <mncharity> but if I run make a second time, I again get Invalid grammatical category: "Bool"

[22:13] <mncharity> which sounds like a parse failure?

[22:14] <mncharity> or not.  maybe

[22:14] <gbacon> mncharity: in util/build_pugs.pl, you should see Pugs mentioned

[22:14] *** Auzon joined
[22:15] <gbacon> mncharity: no, it's confusion deep in the internals

[22:15] <mncharity> re 'util/build_pugs.pl, you should see Pugs mentioned', do.  ?

[22:16] <mncharity> re deep confusion, ah, ok.

[22:17] <gbacon> do you see Pugs added to the package list in util/build_pugs.pl?

[22:19] <mncharity> TimToady: at the other extreme, any feel for how the grammar would fare if poured into a LR(1)?  Or LL(1)?  Or k?  I'm just trying to get a feel for the space of options.

[22:19] <mncharity> If not, np.

[22:19] <mncharity> looking...

[22:20] <gbacon> mncharity: should be around line 611

[22:21] <mncharity> yes

[22:21] <gbacon> mncharity: sorry, 466

[22:21] <gbacon> the build shouldn't complain about unknown Pugs module

[22:21] <mncharity> well, err, right

[22:21] <mncharity> (re 466)

[22:24] <mncharity> I don't suppose it could be something silly like "Setup: /a/home/jobsearch/a_bit_of_perl6/pugsbuild/third-party/installed/share/doc/Pugs-6.2.13/LICENSE: copyFile: does not exist (No such file or directory)" preventing Pugs, just compiled, from becoming available for the next command.

[22:26] <mncharity> I note the error does not occur the second time make is run.

[22:28] <mncharity> Instead there is Installing, and Registering Pugs-6.2.13, and reading/saving/writing package info/config.

[22:30] <gbacon> mncharity: there should also be a mkdir in util/pugs_build.pl

[22:30] <gbacon> at line 619

[22:31] <gbacon> yes, if it can't copy the license file, the install does not finish

[22:31] <mncharity> by  rm -rf third-party/installed/share/doc/Pugs-6.2.13/   I can repeat the cycle.  first make fails to find Pugs, second works, fails with Bool.

[22:34] <gbacon> maybe the whole hierarchy needs to be created :-/

[22:34] <gbacon> phbbbbt

[22:34] <mncharity> however, rm -rf third-party/installed/share/doc/Pugs-6.2.13/* is _not_ sufficient to cause make to fail on Pugs.

[22:34] <mncharity> so it's exactly the (non)existence of third-party/installed/share/doc/Pugs-6.2.13/ which is the problem

[22:34] <gbacon> good catch
