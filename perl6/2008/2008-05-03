[04:06] <mncharity> yay for STD.pm refactoring :)

[04:21] <mncharity> TimToady: "(1)" expect_infix has a context var $op, which doesn't seem to be used anywhere else.  there's a lexical $op in reduce.  "typo" or unfinished refactoring?

[04:25] <mncharity> (2) $<O> looks like it gets copied up to dottyop, but then not up to the dotty:sym's.

[16:17] <mncharity> (3) unlike the other $<O>'s, it looks like lex1 is using it as some kind of context var?  is this intentional, and if so, is there anywhere else where this is done?

[23:56] * spinclad thinks refusing would be good.  it's listed as 'numeric subtraction', and does rely on multi-dispatch; i don't see that this answers your question, though.
