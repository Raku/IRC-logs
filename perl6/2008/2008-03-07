[15:35] <pmurias> what do the "fates" in STD5.pm refere to?

[15:37] <moritz_> re

[15:37] <mncharity> cognominal_: I ran rakudo --target=parse (non-yaml) against pugs's t/spec/.  Using misc/winter_jig/ast_rakudo/parse_t_spec.t.  There more failures than I expected.  Which leaves me wondering,

[15:39] <avar> yes the parser fails on all sorts of strange stuff

[15:40] <[particle]> what does it leave you wondering? rakudo is far from complete

[15:40] <mncharity> pmurias: re fates, my understanding is fuzzy, since STD_red skipped that part, but I believe it is how TimToady's "longest matching DFA engine" (for some reason the name keeps not sticking with me), after a successful matching path is found, tells all the regex parts which way to go (no search required - already done), as they are rerun for sideeffects.  or something like that.

[15:40] <[particle]> and the pugs tests are not designed for partial implementations of perl 6

[15:41] <moritz_> avar: you're free to wonder why it fails once STD.pm runs

[15:41] *** ikeda joined
[15:41] <mncharity> re wondering, sorry, "interleave quick reply" wasn't, let's see...

[15:42] *** ikeda left
[15:43] <mncharity> there are several (well, lots) of rakudo tasks which might be interesting: () getting a feel for why the parses are failing, () fixing them, () getting yaml ast dumping working, () getting yaml dumping of pge match results working.

[15:44] <mncharity> without having a feel for why the parses are failing (I haven't looked yet), I'm unclear on whether getting an ast dump of them working will be of immediate use or not. 

[15:44] <mncharity> I basically have no idea how much/little rakudo is parsing, compared with say kp6.

[15:44] <[particle]> i'm not sure of that, either

[15:45] <[particle]> i guess you could try running kp6 on t/spec

[15:45] <pmurias> mncharity: kp6 dosn't parse expressions correctly

[15:48] <mncharity> err, rephrase, I'm unsure whether the dialect rakudo parses is currently large enough, or includes the "right things", to permit throwing kp6-style "restricted dialect but still usable code" at it.

[15:50] <[particle]> in many of the spec tests, there are directives to skip lines that rakudo can't parse

[15:50] <[particle]> #?rakudo skip "parsefail"

[15:50] <mncharity> eg, yes, I expect its operator precedence parser gives it much more real expressions than kp6 has.  but if, for silly example instance, it can't parse "class" of a class definition, then you couldn't use it to parse "class A {...}", and it wouldn't yet be of help as a frontend.

[15:51] <[particle]> timtoady++ created t/spec/fudge* to handle this preprocessing

[15:51] <[particle]> so far, kp6 hasn't taken advantage of fudge

[15:51] <[particle]> rakudo works very well with classes

[15:52] <mncharity> I've no idea whether the parse failures are of the (very common) form of "wierd little thing one really doesn't need in practice, but is used in the test file, blows out the test".  Or whether, to be silly again, scalars don't parse.

[15:53] <[particle]> iirc named parameter support isn't all there yet

[15:53] <[particle]> otherwise, most common things are parsed

[15:53] <mncharity> If the latter, yaml ast dumping isn't of immediate use.  If the former, one simply "just don't *do* that"'s.

[15:54] <mncharity> re "most common things are parsed", yay :)

[15:55] <mncharity> An interesting test could be to run rakudo against the p6 files kp6 can parse.  Eg, it's test cases.  And see if any parsefail for reasons which are worrying.

[15:59] <[particle]> everything fails to parse

[15:59] <mncharity> looking...

[15:59] <[particle]> however, most failures are likely related to a few root causes

[15:59] <mncharity> cognominal_: progress :)

[16:00] <mncharity> re few root causes, indeed.

[16:01] <cognominal_> I woud really like to use a grammr derived from rakudo to template a small web site.

[16:02] <mncharity> :)

[16:03] <moritz_> cognominal_: actually I thought about a PGE based template system as well ;-)

[16:04] <moritz_> I'm currently updating http://dev.perl.org/perl6/ - any thoughts what's most urgent?

[16:04] <avar> [particle]: I did that a few months ago and some of it parsed

[16:04] *** masak left
[16:04] <avar> [particle]: A lot of those are due to anonymous =begin/=end blocks. I submitted a patch to fix that but it was rejected

[16:05] <[particle]> 1) i've been working on a pod6 grammar, kp6 could steal that

[16:06] <[particle]> 2) i've been changing t/spec tests to pod6

[16:06] *** ikeda joined
[16:06] <[particle]> so, i think kp6 should migrate from pod5 to pod6, and it's definitely possible now

[16:06] <mncharity> cognominal_: so I'm wondering if () get rakudo to parse the kp6 tests (or to only not parse for reasons which can be workaround when using it as a frontend), () add yaml match dumping to pge, to give the world access to pge, might be "more useful in themselves" short term goals than the ast yaml dump?  thoughts?

[16:06] *** ikeda left
[16:07] <mncharity> the first seem at least something vaguely like a prerequisite for then actually using ast yaml dumps as a frontend.

[16:07] <[particle]> pod6 grammar: http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/languages/perl6/src/utils/perl6doc/grammar.pg

[16:07] <cognominal_> mncharity, I just mailed the author of the yaml dumper to make availaible his libsyck library tuned for parrot

[16:07] <[particle]> what yaml dumper?

[16:08] <[particle]> why modify libsyck?

[16:08] <[particle]> i wrote a yaml dumper written in pir

[16:08] <[particle]> it's just not finished yet

[16:08] * mncharity goes to finish cleanup up from svn mess.

[16:10] <cognominal_> I am speaking of library/YAML/Dumper.pir which used a modified libsyck library

[16:11] <[particle]> ok. i wrote that.

[16:11] <[particle]> i copied it from parrot's Dumper.pir

[16:11] <[particle]> never modified the author info

[16:12] <cognominal_> so what's the story about the modified libsyck?

[16:13] <[particle]> i don't know what you're talking about

[16:15] <mncharity> sigh.  and no time for actual work now.  ah well.

[16:15] <cognominal_> there may be two yaml parrot libraries

[16:15] <[particle]> i wrote yaml_dumper.pir, YAML/Dumper.pir, YAML/Dumper/Default.pir and YAML/Dumper/Base.pir

[16:16] <[particle]> all of which are compiled down to yaml_dumper.pbc

[16:16] <cognominal_> the library I used call libsyck

[16:16] <cognominal_> or so it says

[16:17] <cognominal_> ho, that the parser...

[16:17] <cognominal_> I am confused

[16:18] <mncharity> To recap, svn co from r20077 until r20079, would leave a broken local svn filesystem.  Folks running, or knowing of, svn mirrors for pugs, please try to "svn up", to see if they got wedged.  Sorry for the hassle.  Thank you.

[16:18] <cognominal_> it gets confusing when navigating too much sources

[16:19] <mncharity> It's sufficient to "svn up"(or whatever) in misc/pX/Common, if you don't want to affect the rest of your world.

[18:29] <ruoso> mncharity, I'm using a KP6 grammar in sm0p, but it's failing to match a file and I can't see why... if you have some time, could you please take a look at the files referred above and see if you can see what I am missing?

[18:49] <mncharity> ruoso: certainly, will do.  but i'm afraid it will be this now+8ish hours, or tomorrow.

[18:57] <cognominal_> in a rakudo grammar, 2<3>  matches   I would like in the postcircumfix action to test if  the expression in the left is not a scalar litteral to rule out that case

[18:58] <cognominal_> hum

[18:59] *** ikeda joined
[18:59] <cognominal_> well I could do it in the action that corresponds to the parent rule

[20:05] <cognominal_> you mean it's ok to whine at execution versus compilation?

[20:05] <TimToady> you can always whine at compilation if you can prove something will whine at run time

[20:06] <cognominal_> here, I can't?

[20:06] <TimToady> or if you pragmatically ask for it to assume that certain things won't change

[20:06] <TimToady> such as adding the Hash role to integers :)

[20:06] <cognominal_> ho boy

[20:07] <cognominal_> ok, obviously, I am still in a compiled language mindset

[20:08] <cognominal_> with better errors messages I can live with that.
