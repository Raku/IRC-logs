[13:19] <masak> I have a comment about S05:

[13:20] <masak> the list item under "Extensible metasyntax (<...>)" starting "In any case of regex interpolation," seems a bit out of place

[13:20] <masak> all the other list items talk about what can be part of the <...> syntax

[13:20] <masak> but that one (seemingly) doesn't

[13:24] <masak> hm, S05:1193 I think

[13:26] *** pdy joined
[13:28] <masak> also, at "A leading %" under the same section, I'm a bit lost on two accounts. What does it mean to match "like a bare hash", and what does a closure do when it does "whatever it likes"? Some short examples or smartlinks would probably clear it up a bit.

[13:28] *** iblechbot left
[13:29] <masak> that's S05:1158

[13:32] <masak> what's the difference between 'eager' and 'greedy' backtracking?

[13:33] <Gothmog_> wasn't that about returning every possible match, eg a, aa, aaa if you match "aaa" ~~ /a+/?

[13:34] <masak> Gothmog_: yes, I think you're right

[13:34] <pmurias> masak: if you use <$var> var is interpolated as a regex

[13:37] <masak> pmurias: yes, it is.

[13:38] <masak> does that have some connection to base hashes that I'm missing?

[13:39] <pmurias> so if the previous items mentions the ways of interpolating a regex, the next one explains it's semantics

[13:41] *** turrepurre left
[13:41] <pmurias> S05:924 explains how bare hashes interpolate

[13:43] <masak> ah, ok

[13:45] <pmurias> i think an eager backtracking matches the smallest amount of the atom possible at the first try

[13:45] <pmurias> perl -e '"1111" =~ /11*?(1+)/;print "{$1}\n"'

[13:45] <pmurias> print {11}

[13:46] <pmurias> err, perl -e '"1111" =~ /11+?(1+)/;print "{$1}\n"'

[13:46] <pmurias> * prints

[13:46] <masak> so eager backtracking is the opposite of greedy backtracking?

[13:46] <pmurias> yes

[13:47] <masak> ah, ok

[13:47] <masak> I can see how they are, but they don't sound opposite :)

[13:48] <masak> instead of 'eager backtracking' I think I would have talked about 'minimal repetitions'

[13:57] *** IRSeekBot left
[14:01] *** IRSeekBot joined
[14:03] <pmurias> masak: the polish translation of programming perl uses the terms "minimalistic" and "maximalistic" quantifiers 

[14:04] <masak> ok :)

[14:05] <masak> I believe that even in English sometimes they occur as synonyms of 'greedy' and 'reluctant', respectively

[14:13] <pmurias> reluctant would be a good replacement for eager

[14:14] <pmurias> gnu autotools are annoying

[14:17] <pmurias> i want to play with smop a bit but autotools require .deps/repl.Po whatever that is

[18:34] <diakopter> I'm bothered by the varying ways to declare dependencies for modules

[18:36] <diakopter> I'm bothered that buildtime (mostly testing) dependencies are not declared separately from runtime and installtime dependencies.

[18:40] <diakopter> I'm bothered that, once a module is installed, perl does not know about the buildtime and installtime dependencies, so the dependent module has to detect (test for) the dependencies itself, all over again, in order to fail verbosely.

[18:45] <pugs_svnbot> r19936 | putter++ | [misc/red_STD] took a break from transliteration to slightly increase the set of things correctly parsed.  synced commented-out heredoc with STD.pm.

[18:45] <lambdabot> Title: Changeset 19936 - Pugs - Trac

[18:46] <diakopter> I'm bothered that "optional" dependencies (dependencies that might not be loaded/used) are allowed to exist in a non-plugin fashion.  That is, it bothers me that if a certain optional behavior of a module can be dependent on whether another module (or any other system package from the system distribution) is installed, those intricacies have to be handled by the module itself (when the module designer does not plugin-ize the optional be

[18:47] <mncharity> diakopter: long comment warning: I see it end with "does not plugin-ize the optional be"

[18:48] <diakopter> mncharity: you missed only the end of the last word - behavior).

[18:50] <diakopter> these thoughts are definitely not fully formed.

[18:50] <diakopter> reading about Best Practical's Shipwright triggered these thoughts.

[18:51] <diakopter> let me restate them from a non-negative tack

[18:53] <diakopter> I wish a module's dependencies would always be written declaratively, organized/demarcated by phase.  Let's say a module is "installed" in your current working directory.  

[18:55] <diakopter> scratch that last sentence.  Thinking on it more.

[18:57] <ruoso> diakopter, taking that simple... you're just saying that CPAN needed a full-featured package management system, like the debian packaging...

[18:57] <ruoso> and besides source-distribution... a binary-distribution would be an important feature... 

[18:59] <ruoso> later &

[18:59] <diakopter> ruoso: I'm not sure.  I need to study/read more to be able to talk about this intelligently
