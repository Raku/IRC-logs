[16:20] <Muixirt> I'm confused

[16:21] <Muixirt> perl6 -e 'say 7.2*12345679'

[16:21] <Muixirt> 8.8889e+07

[16:21] <Muixirt> perl6 -e 'say 12345679*7.2'

[16:21] <Muixirt> 9.96345e+08

[16:22] <Muixirt> perl -e 'print 12345679*7.2,"\n"'

[16:22] <Muixirt> 88888888.8

[16:22] <Muixirt> what do I make wrong?

[16:23] <Muixirt> perl6 -e 'say 12345679.0*7.2'

[16:23] <Muixirt> 8.8889e+07

[16:24] *** wtgee left
[16:27] *** wtgee joined
[16:27] <Muixirt> anyone with insights in that?

[16:31] <Muixirt> perl6 -e 'say 1*7.2'

[16:31] <Muixirt> 9.96345e+08

[16:31] <Muixirt> the '1' in 1*7.2 is interpreted as what (i have no clue)

[16:40] *** chris2 left
[16:40] <Zaba> does pugs aim to be (as fast as|faster than) perl5?

[16:43] <Muixirt> pugs aim was to be a reference implementation of perl6

[16:44] <Zaba> speed is always a good thing.. ;>

[16:44] <Muixirt> i think speed is not a top priority for the pugs project

[16:45] <Muixirt> but anyway, pugs development seemed to be stalled

[16:45] <Zaba> oh :(

[16:45] <Muixirt> there is more activity on the rakudo project, another implementation of perl6

[16:45] <Zaba> what is it written in?

[16:46] <Muixirt> perl6 and pir

[16:46] <Zaba> pir?

[16:46] <Muixirt> the native language of parrot

[16:46] <Zaba> well, also, how complete are perl6 specs?

[16:47] <Muixirt> (parrot is the virtual machine for executing perl6 bytecode)

[16:47] <Zaba> I've heard of parrot

[16:47] <Zaba> never tried it for perl6, though

[16:53] <Zaba> hmm

[16:53] <Zaba> perhaps I should

[16:54] <Muixirt> k

[16:56] <Zaba> is there any (D)VCS repository for rakudo code?

[16:59] <Muixirt> it is in the parrot repo.

[16:59] <Zaba> hmm

[16:59] <Zaba> then I suppose having svn parrot would make much more sense as well

[17:00] <Muixirt> yes
