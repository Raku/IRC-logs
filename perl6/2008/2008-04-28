[17:49] <nwc10> does pugs implement state?

[17:49] <nwc10> I've build rakudo and it does not :-(

[17:50] *** japhb left
[17:50] <PerlJam> so implement it for rakudo or bug the people working on rakudo for it.

[17:50] <nwc10> that wasn't actually an answer to my question.

[17:50] <PerlJam> The best way to find out if pugs groks state is to either read the source or compile pugs and run a test program.

[17:51] <nwc10> I'm not in an easy position to compile pugs - I don't that that I have access to any machine with ghc on

[17:51] <nwc10> the pugs evalbot died a long time ago?

[17:52] <PerlJam> pugs seems to parse state just fine.

[17:52] <nwc10> cool. thanks. I'll bug someone to install ghc

[17:52] <nwc10> so that I can (at some point) write regression tests for 5.11

[17:54] <PerlJam> doesn't look like pugs groks initializer semantics though.

[17:54] <PerlJam> oh, wait.  Yes is does

[17:54] <PerlJam> s/is/it/

[17:54] <PerlJam> silly me for writing a bogus test.

[17:56] <Tene> nwc10: You should try asking about state in #parrot on irc.perl.org

[17:59] <nwc10> thanks

[17:59] <PerlJam> yikes.  someone needs to update the parrot installed on feather.

[17:59] <PerlJam> $ /usr/bin/parrot --version

[17:59] <PerlJam> This is parrot version 0.4.5-devel (r13933) built for i386-linux.

[17:59] <Juerd> PerlJam: How about I give you access to do it yourself? :)

[18:00] <PerlJam> Juerd: I was hoping you weren't listening  ;)  Sure, go ahead.

[18:00] <Juerd> I have a highlight on "feather". Now you can avoid it in the future ;)

[18:00] <PerlJam> heh

[18:00] <Juerd> What is your login?

[18:00] <PerlJam> duff

[18:01] <Juerd> Your job description is now "keeping parrot up to date"

[18:01] <Juerd> Let me know when/if you no longer want that

[18:01] <Juerd> You may use sudo now

[18:02] <PerlJam> wait a second ... I forgot about feather's split personality.  Where is it describe what the various feathers are for?

[18:02] <PerlJam> (hoping I'm just on the wrong one  ;)

[18:02] <Juerd> Er, nowhere actually.

[18:02] <Juerd> feather0 - domain 0 to manage the other feathers

[18:02] <Juerd> feather1 - semi-public access shell box

[18:03] <Juerd> feather2 - for important stuff like repositories and websites, but nobody is using this yet

[18:03] <Juerd> feather3 - for dangerous stuff like evalbots

[18:03] <Juerd> In general, bare "feather" refers to feather1.

[18:03] <PerlJam> right, so does that mean I have sudo on them all or just feather1?

[18:03] <Juerd> 1

[18:03] <PerlJam> gotcha

[18:04] <Juerd> If you need access to the other feathers, let me know. feather0 is Juerd only :)

[18:04] <PerlJam> well, why isn't anyone using feather2?

[18:04] <Juerd> Because nobody has tuits to move things around.

[18:04] <Juerd> It was invented for the Pugs repository, the Pugs website, Commitbit, etc.

[18:04] *** _cj left
[18:05] <Juerd> It takes either someone who knows how those things work, or someone with sufficient tuits to find out.

[18:05] <Juerd> And of course additional tuits to actually do it.

[18:05] <PerlJam> My tuits are small and constantly interrupted by my wife or kids, so I may be able to pile enough of them together to do something useful with feather2 at some point.

[18:05] <Juerd> Neat!

[18:06] <PerlJam> anyway, that's for another day.  right now, I need to stop procrastinating and get back to work.

[18:06] <pugs_svnbot> r20315 | clkao++ | support default values.

[18:06] <PerlJam> talk to you all later

[18:06] * PerlJam &

[18:06] <Juerd> See ya, and thanks in advance for updating parrot

[18:08] <ruoso> if someone is subscribed to perl6-all only... is there some restriction on posting to the other lists? or it's just the lists that have a huuge delay?

[18:08] <Juerd> The lists are moderated. The delay is dependent on the tuits of the moderators

[18:09] <Juerd> It may take up to a few days in severe circumstances.

[18:09] <ruoso> oh... ok...

[18:09] <ruoso> all the traffic? or non-subscribers only?

[18:09] <Juerd> Fortunately they do whitelist :)

[18:09] <Juerd> IIRC all not previously whitelisted posters, but perhaps subscribers are whitelisted automagically.

[18:10] * ruoso wonders if subscribing to -all puts you in the whitelist already...

[18:10] <Juerd> Very probably not.

[18:10] <Juerd> I think they're individual lists

[18:11] <ruoso> :/

[18:11] * ruoso not in the mood for unsubscribing all and subscribing each one right now... :|

[18:12] *** pmurias joined
[18:14] <pmurias> Juerd: they are moderated against spam?

[18:15] <Juerd> I don't know against what exactly

[18:15] <Juerd> Probably spam, abuse, trolls, etc :0

[18:15] * ruoso wonders if any moderators could be reached to whitelist me without having to switch the subscritions...

[18:16] <Juerd> They'll see your message when they do their queue

[18:16] <Juerd> If you need speedier communication NOW, you could bounce your message to other members manually.

[18:17] <ruoso> nah... it's not that important... (if it makes there in any reasonable amount of time)

[18:18] * ruoso bbl &

[18:18] <[particle]> Juerd: i have little excuse not to ask for similar access

[18:20] <Juerd> [particle]: What role description can I jot down for you? :)

[18:20] <Juerd> (Recorded in /etc/sudoers)

[18:21] <[particle]> parrot underlord.

[18:21] <Juerd> Translate it to sysadmin speak please :)

[18:22] <Juerd> Does this mean keeping it updated?

[18:22] <Juerd> Testing? Bashing? :)

[18:22] <[particle]> i wanna make sure parrot and rakudo are up to date and functional

[18:25] <Juerd> Ok!

[18:26] <Juerd> pasteling: You can now sudo

[18:26] <Juerd> And thanks :)

[18:26] <[particle]> pasteling probably won't do much sudoing :)

[18:26] <[particle]> and thank you!

[18:27] <Juerd> Er... The other pa[tab]
