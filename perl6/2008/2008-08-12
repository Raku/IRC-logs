[11:21] <Juerd> To see if I can legally park there

[11:21] <Juerd> Someone said yes, but yesterday some other cph inhabitant said no.

[11:22] <pmurias> Juerd: what are you doing after that?

[11:22] <Juerd> After that I will try to find an ATM

[11:22] <Juerd> I'm out of kroner

[11:24] <pmurias> can one pay in euro here?

[11:29] <Juerd> My tomtom has ATMs for Sweden, not for Denmark

[11:29] <Juerd> So if I ask it to navigate to one, it'll send me to Malmö... :)

[13:45] <ron> have done similar tests under perl5 and believe perl5 resolves at compile time.

[13:45] <ron> have read that perl6 does not use bar words but class tests seem to use them.

[13:45] <ron> should I start to document some of this stuff somewhere?

[13:46] <ron> bar -> bare

[13:47] <ron> perl6: class Foo { method fooey {say 'fooey'} }; class goo { method gooey {say 'gooey'} };  my $goo = goo.new; $goo.gooey;

[13:48] <ruoso> I think pugs is right in both cases...

[13:50] <ruoso> bare "goo" geos through standard symbol lookup

[13:50] <ruoso> and it finds the closest definition

[13:50] <ruoso> which is sub goo

[13:51] <ron> From what I could tell with --target=past|post|pir in last case rakudo still looking for sub and not sure whether lookup is done. 

[13:52] <ruoso> in that case, rakudo is presuming class must have a uppercase first letter... which is wrong iirc

[14:10] <ruoso> I think a warning would be ok when not using 'my sub'

[14:12] *** iblechbot joined
[14:12] <ruoso> or even when declaring a 'my sub' that overrides a package sub...

[14:13] <ruoso> or a pre-declared class...

[14:15] <ruoso> and also when declaring a sub that overrides a class declaration...

[14:16] <ruoso> since subs and classes can both be used without sigil (since that classes doesn't have a sigil)

[14:16] <ron> pugs: sub foo { print "foo1\n"; }; {  sub foo { print "foo2\n"; }; foo(); }; foo();

[14:16] <p6eval> pugs: OUTPUT[foo2␤foo1␤]

[14:17] <ron> in perl5 with warnings there is a sub redefined warning

[14:17] <ron> does the evalbot print warnings?

[14:17] <[particle]> most of the perl 6 implementations don't do warnings yet

[14:18] <ruoso> that might be right, as bare 'sub' is not the same as 'my sub'

[14:18] <pmurias> ruoso: why does every SMOP__Object need to have a data?

[14:18] *** Exodist joined
[14:19] <ruoso> pmurias, it was to allow responder interfaces to be treated as regular objects....

[14:19] <ruoso> but I'm not sure anymore that this is actually required

[14:20] <ruoso> considering that ->data is only accessed by the object itself

[14:20] <ruoso> we could move the data pointer to a SMOP_LOWLEVEL_OBJECT_BASE struct

[14:20] <ruoso> since smop_lowlevel uses that pointer to hold lock and refcnt informatoin

[14:21] <ruoso> but that is a quite extensive refactoring...

[14:21] <pmurias> loads of search and replace ;)

[14:21] <ron> rakudo: say $*ERR: "HOWDY";

[14:23] <ruoso> pmurias, I'm neglecting that question because we're talking about just one pointer, and mostly because most objects so far are using it...

[14:23] <ruoso> (all objects that use smop_lowlevel do)

[14:24] *** ggoebel joined
[14:24] <ruoso> but we might get into this issue before "1.0" ;)

[14:25] <ruoso> pmurias, btw... about code object... I forgot one attribute when we were talking about it...

[14:26] <ruoso> class Code { has $.outer; has $.mold; has $.signature; method postcircumfix:<()> {... } }

[14:26] <ruoso> and I'm thinking about having signature like:

[14:27] <ruoso> class Signature { method ACCEPTS (Capture $c) {...}; method BIND (Capture $c, LexicalScope $l) {...} };

[14:27] *** meppl left
[14:27] <ruoso> this way we can have a lowlevel implementation of the default block signature...

[14:28] <ruoso> we can even compile lowlevel implementations for the Signatures we use in s1p...

[14:29] <pmurias> ruoso: i think we should try to have as little stuff in C as possible

[14:30] *** iblechbot left
[14:30] <ruoso> we can have a signature compiler

[14:30] <ruoso> and not write it in C

[14:30] <ruoso> instead of instantiating a Signature object, we create a new type specifically for that block :)

[14:31] <ruoso> or re-use for identical signatures...

[14:31] <ruoso> (specially the default block signature

[14:31] <pmurias> the JIT can wait a bit 

[14:32] <ruoso> no... it's not just in time... it's compilation to  static C code...

[14:32] <ruoso> s1p doesn't have a real interpreter yet... 

[14:32] <ruoso> and won't have...

[14:32] <ruoso> it will be compiled to static C code...

[14:33] *** ggoebel left
[14:34] <pmurias> ruoso: what do you mean by a real interpreter one which compiles and runs lines one by one

[14:34] <pmurias> ?

[14:34] <ruoso> I mean... ( $_ is rw = OUTER::<$_> ) would be compiled to a smop responder interface that implements ACCEPTS and BIND for that specific signature...

[14:35] <pmurias> re real interpreter i reread and got it

[14:35] <pmurias> i'm actually thinking of taking the .pbc spec and adapting it to smop

[14:36] <pmurias> but it's just an optimalisation so it can wait

[14:36] <ruoso> I think so

[14:37] <ron> so I'm guessing that there may need to be some kind of compile time symbol table lookup for some of these bareword cases ...  If anyone actually knows I'm curious ...

[14:37] <ruoso> ron, after bootstrapping, yes... but s1p is a 1st stage compiler that won't have this kind of lookup...

[14:39] *** cognominal__ joined
[14:43] <pmurias> ruoso: do you know how to compile a C file using smop withought putting it into the Makefile?

[14:44] <ruoso> pmurias, what's the problem of putting it into Makefile

[14:46] <pmurias> i'm testing switching p6 code from slime to mold
