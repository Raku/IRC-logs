[03:57] <zonkers> whoa

[03:57] <TimToady> my head is spinning. :)

[03:57] <zonkers> is there  a ball park date of the release?

[03:57] <zonkers> end of 2008 mid 2009?

[03:57] *** d4l3k_ is now known as dalek

[03:57] <TimToady> we don't do dates, because you can't predict how volunteer error will manifest itself

[03:58] <TimToady> but we're a lot closer than we were a year ago...

[03:58] <zonkers> i would certainly hope so.

[03:58] <TimToady> s/error/effort/ grr

[03:59] <TimToady> anyway, feel free to volunteer :)

[03:59] <zonkers> my boss can't believe how productive  i can be in perl

[03:59] <zonkers> my co workers are so stuck in their little java worlds

[03:59] <TimToady> we hope to improve on p5 productivity greatly

[04:00] <TimToady> and nobody is more impatient to get it done than we are.  :)

[04:01] <TimToady> that is, after all, why we're working on it as hard as we are...

[04:01] <zonkers> it has to be tough because of all the perl code that exists out there now

[04:01] <TimToady> nah, we can always just feed that to p5 :)

[04:02] <TimToady> or to a p5 interpreter embedded in a p6 one

[04:02] <TimToady> or we can translate it

[04:02] <TimToady> but mostly it'll be new code in p6

[04:02] <TimToady> it's not like p5 is going to suddenly stop working

[04:03] <TimToady> I expect there will still be all kinds of p5 code out there ten years from now

[04:03] <TimToady> you can still see p4 code out there in the wide world...

[04:04] <TimToady> 'course, part of the reason for that is that p5 will run p4 code

[04:04] *** Jamtech joined

[04:19] <SamB> if they mistook him for one of those horse things...

[04:21] <katie_d> I'm starting to try to grok the Parrot sources, and I was thinking about writing a set of guides for beginners who want to learn how things work, as I go along. As far as using snippets from trunk/docs/ -- what are the licensing requirements? As long as the information on my site is released under the same terms, with a link to the Artistic license that Perl uses, I am allowed to use them wherever I want, correct?
