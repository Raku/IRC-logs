[14:45] <pmurias> ruoso: do you think Capture.new_without_invocant makes sense?

[14:45] <ruoso> pmurias, I think a lowlevel thingy that returns the capture itself would be clearer

[14:45] <ruoso> because as a lowlevel thingy it doesn't need to use the invocant of the incoming capture

[14:46] <ruoso> so you could even have

[14:46] *** jhorwitz left
[14:46] <ruoso> ¢SMOP__S1P__Capturize.new($foo: 1,2,3, :a(1))

[14:46] <ruoso> I mean... that is a lowlevel operation... 

[14:47] <pmurias> creating a new opcode for capture creation?

[14:47] <ruoso> pmurias, yeah... maybe

[14:48] <ruoso> as you have an op that receives all parameters

[14:48] <ruoso> s/op/call op/

[14:48] <ruoso> you could have a capture op  that receives all the parameters and return the capture

[14:56] <pmurias> ruoso: do you want be to implement anything multi releated?

[14:57] <ruoso> pmurias, If you want, you could take .() on s1p_multi

[14:57] <pugs_svn> r22627 | ruoso++ | [smop] basis for multi implementation;

[14:58] <ruoso> I'm quite overwhelmed at the moment... I'll only get back to it tonight or tomorrow

[14:58] <pmurias> ok

[15:01] <pmurias> ruoso: how do you plan to sort AdhocSingnatures?

[15:02] <ruoso> pmurias, I'm not sure yet... I was thinking in failing on ambiguous dispatch until we figure that out

[15:02] *** fridim_ left
[15:04] <pmurias> do we know how to implement binding yet?

[15:06] <TimToady> in general it must be done in order of formal parameters so that default expressions can refer to earlier ones

[15:06] *** ejs left
[15:06] *** rindolf joined
[15:07] <TimToady> (or should at least give that appearance :)

[15:08] <ruoso> pmurias, yes... by using 'bvalue context'

[15:08] * ruoso beer^Wlunch &

[15:11] <pmurias> what i meant is how are we going to do bvalue context with the "lazy context propagation"?

[15:12] <rindolf> TimToady: hi.

[15:17] *** pedrob joined
[15:19] *** adc_Penner joined
[15:23] <ruoso> pmurias, the same way we do with everything else

[15:24] <ruoso> the difference is that 'bvalue' is a "shadow" contex

[15:24] <ruoso> *context

[15:24] <ruoso> meaning that if you call a FETCH on a bvalue it will delegate directly as if it weren't a bvalue

[15:24] <ruoso> the same with STORE

[15:25] <ruoso> it can then BIND to another value
