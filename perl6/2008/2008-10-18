[06:46] <wayland_> Question; is there anything like Data::Dumper for Rakudo?

[06:46] <wayland_> Or rather, is there any way I can get documentation on the tree that is built after running a grammar?

[07:04] <wayland_> Ok, I've discovered that a Regex is a Sub object; anyone know how to get a list of attributes for a Sub object?

[07:07] <wayland_> Although if anyone knows how to do it for a whole grammar, that would be even better

[11:28] <masak> if "file" ~~ :e returns whether a file exists, what should "file" ~~ :foo return?

[11:35] *** wayland_ left
[11:36] *** azawawi left
[11:39] <masak> what's the easiest way to ask "is this range a part of that range" in Perl 6?

[11:42] *** pmurias joined
[11:43] <pmurias> masak: re first question see S03:2999

[11:44] <pmurias> re second $elem ~~ $range

[11:44] <masak> pmurias: I see the line, but I'm not sure how that answers the question

[11:44] <masak> pmurias: I'm talking about two ranges, not an elem and a range

[11:45] <masak> does S03:2999 mean that it tries to call a method, regardless?

[11:45] <pmurias> i think so

[11:45] <masak> I can do that :)

[11:46] <pmurias> $a.min >= $b.min && $a.max <= $b.max

[11:46] <masak> so, in effect "file" ~~ :e translates to "file".:e(1), right?

[11:47] <masak> pmurias: ok, that's reasonable

[11:47] <masak> you could even do that with just <= comparisons

[11:48] <masak> $b.min <= $a.min <= $a.max <= $b.max

[11:49] <pmurias> nicer, i'm not used to <= doing chaining yet

[11:49] <masak> I'm still trying to decide if it's nicer or not :)

[11:51] <masak> rakudo: "file".:e(1)

[11:51] <masak> oy

[11:51] <pmurias> it's closer to the way ranges would be represented on a line

[11:51] <masak> that's true

[11:51] <masak> in "file".:e(1), is the method name ':e' ?

[11:52] <masak> rakudo: "file".':e'(1)
