[14:38] <Muixirt> hi

[14:39] <Muixirt> is there a way to build pugs with ghc version 6.6.1 ?

[14:40] *** syle joined
[14:40] <syle> is it possible to do async connect() with IO::Socket in perl5?

[14:45] *** cj left
[14:46] <allbery_b> syle: this channel is for perl 6 development.  try #perl for perl 5 questions

[14:47] <Muixirt> hi allbery_b 

[14:48] <allbery_b> I haven't managed to get pugs to build in a long time... have heard someone was supposed to be working on fixing it, but that's all I know about it :(

[14:49] <Muixirt> ok allbery_b 

[14:49] * Muixirt wonders about the status of pugs

[14:57] <allbery_b> essentially defunct; it served its purpose but development has moved on.  parrot/rakudo is developing quickly, the pugs repo hosts the gtest suite, the Perl-6.0.0-STD specification, and "elf" which is a stage in an iterative self-bootstrapping system which is ultimately supposed to compile Perl-6.0.0-STD

[14:58] <allbery_b> I gather audreyt is sort of back part time, and is splitting pugs up into useful bits that can be reused elsewhere

[14:58] <allbery_b> (I think Pugs reched the point where it would have to be rewritten from scratch to catch up with the spec)

[15:01] <Muixirt> i wonder if someone has listed somewhere the insights that came out of developing pugs

[15:03] <allbery_b> I don't think so, not as such.  most of them were figuring out what works and what doesn't from a language standpoint (i.e. what constructs are usable and what to change to make others usable)

[15:03] <allbery_b> as such they're mostly reflected in the synopses and the 6.0.0-STD spec

[15:07] <Muixirt> i especially mean the insights into the shortcomings of pugs

[15:11] <allbery_b> I think the main issue there is Pugs was audreyt's baby, and when health forced her to drop out it stopped where it was, while the perl6 spec moved on

[15:12] <allbery_b> not many people besides audreyt understand the implementation.  (even if they understand Haskell.  I was able to do some stuff with it but other things defeated me, for example there's something odd about the way the parser is implemented)

[15:15] <allbery_b> there were some things I tried to do that looked like they should work but have complex interrelationships such that making certain changes broke not-obviously-related aspects fo the parser

[15:21] <Muixirt> ok thanks

[15:23] <allbery_b> (some of it led to language reformulations, e.g. the Perl5-style filetests turned out to have too many interactions with parsing other things and were dropped in favor of adverbs (e.g. -r became :r)

[15:24] <allbery_b> the reuslt is arguably more perl6-ish, albeit foreign to perl5 folks.  (syle:  this is one reason #perl6 is not the place to ask perl5 questions)

[19:51] <rindolf> Hi all.

[19:51] <Limbic_Region> oh, has anyone read John M. Dlugosz's paper on p6's polymorphism?

[19:51] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: are you subscribed to [email@hidden.address]
[19:51] <Limbic_Region> salutations rindolf

[19:52] <Limbic_Region> rindolf - I do not believe so - no

[19:52] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: is the weather nice outside?

[19:52] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: ah, OK.

[19:52] <Limbic_Region> not today, it was beautiful yesterday though

[19:52] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: we had a bit of a flamewar.

[19:52] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: ah, OK.

[19:52] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: it was very nice day, but I had work to do. :-(

[19:52] <rindolf> The spring is turning into Summer here.

[19:53] <Limbic_Region> who is "we"

[19:54] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: well, technically I Started it.

[19:54] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: but it was very civilised until Elaine Ashton joined.

[20:03] * Limbic_Region just finished reading the thread

[20:03] * Limbic_Region laughs

[20:03] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: heh.

[20:03] <rindolf> That's HFB for you.

[20:03] <Limbic_Region> rindolf - kids, plural.  They are both doing fine

[20:03] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: OK.

[20:03] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: how old are they?

[20:04] <Limbic_Region> rindolf - http://www.gatcomb.org/age.cgi

[20:04] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: Arabic and Hebrew has a special form for "Two".

[20:04] <lambdabot> Title: The Gatcomb Girl Ages

[20:04] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: though in Hebrew this form is normally considered archaic.

[20:04] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: I see.

[20:05] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: can Jasmine talk yet?

[20:05] <Limbic_Region> Jasmine has been speaking in complete sentences for some time now

[20:05] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: oh, nice.

[20:05] <Limbic_Region> heck, read http://www.gatcomb.org/joshua/2008/04/when-your-2-year-old-knows-mor.html

[20:07] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: heh, nice.

[20:07] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: how did she learn Spanish?

[20:07] <Limbic_Region> Dora The Explorer

[20:07] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: it's a good idea to talk to young children in as many languges as possible.

[20:07] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: a show on T.V.?

[20:07] <Limbic_Region> yes

[20:08] <Limbic_Region> rindolf - yes, I know - she will be multi-lingual

[20:08] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: OK.

[20:08] <Limbic_Region> the other day she made up a story for me:  "Once upon a time, there was a princess - the end".  "That's a good story Daddy"

[20:08] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: my oldest second nephew is very intelligent for his age.

[20:08] <Limbic_Region> in any event, the channel should probably be kept on topic

[20:08] <rindolf> He could eject the CD tray and give me the DVD last year.

[20:09] <rindolf> And this year he is able to operate a digital camera.

[20:09] <Limbic_Region> kids are amazing

[20:10] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: you should also talk to her in Perl 5 and Perl 6.

[20:10] <rindolf> ;-)

[20:10] * Limbic_Region wanders off

[20:11] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: bye.

[20:11] <Limbic_Region> TTFN rindolf - nice chatting with you

[20:11] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: likewise.

[20:11] <rindolf> Ta ta for now?

[20:11] <Limbic_Region> yes, from winnie the pooh

[20:11] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: ah.

[20:11] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: haven't read it yet.

[20:11] <rindolf> Maybe I'll order it from Amazon.

[20:11] <rindolf> Or something.

[20:12] <Limbic_Region> it's a kid's story - and there isn't just 1 book

[20:12] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: I know, I know.

[20:12] <rindolf> Limbic_Region: still, I have a thing for children's literature.

[20:12] <rindolf> Even as an adult.

[20:12] <Limbic_Region> oh, today is the end of passover - /me extends whatever the proper greeting is for that and wanders off to spend the rest of his weekend with his girls

[20:13] <Limbic_Region> TTFN

[20:13] * Limbic_Region AFK &

[20:13] <rindolf> At the moment I'm reading "The Virtue of Selfishness" and "I am Charlotte Simmons" by Tom Wolfe, but find it hard to keep up with both.
