[15:08] <masak> and both :ii and :sigspace are modifiers to s///, not to m//, right?

[15:09] <pmurias> masak: why shouldn't they apply to m//?

[15:09] <masak> hm, becuase preserving case does not make sense when only matching

[15:10] <masak> but I think I'm wrong about :sigspace

[15:10] <pmurias> S05:254

[15:11] <pmurias> but you are right on :ii

[15:11] <masak> ah, good

[15:12] <pmurias> the harder problem is what is :ii long form ;)

[15:12] <masak> :)

[15:12] <masak> ':iiggnnoorreeccaassee'?

[15:15] <masak> actually, I think of it as ':preservespace', but that doesn't fit well into the ':ii' form

[15:15] <masak> um, I meant ':preservecase'

[15:16] <rhr_> the function behind it is called samecase (:bb is samebase)

[17:20] <rhr_> diakopter: thanks!

[17:27] <diakopter> rhr_: it's the same SVN::Web instance as, say, http://parrotvm.org/svn/parrot/revision/?rev=25767

[17:29] <diakopter> personally, I kinda hope the pugs trac instance doesn't resurrect; the contents of its wiki have all been ported over to the new wiki at tPF's site

[17:30] <nothingmuch> ah

[17:30] <diakopter> that and it was a major pain to get working on Feather 1.0

[17:31] <diakopter> re-working, I mean

[17:31] <diakopter> under apache 2.0

[17:48] <SamB> are they ... CPU numbers?

[17:49] <diakopter> Juerd: oh, I was using them to mean release editions.

[17:50] <diakopter> where 0.0 was the original configuration (original to me), with all the separate apache instances, and then Feather 1.0 was the one with all the sites integrated into one apache 2.0

[21:12] <pmurias> ok ;)

[21:15] <pmurias> what is the right gcc invocantion to compile foo.c using smop?

[21:19] <pmurias> ruoso: figured it out

[21:22] <wolverian> can you define your own sigils? 

[21:22] <pmurias> wolverian: not easily

[21:23] <wolverian> mmhm

[21:23] <pmurias> you can extend the grammar

[21:23] *** ofer left
[21:23] <wolverian> is the definition of a sigil's interface interleaved in the grammar?

[21:25] <wolverian> that was probably badly worded :)

[21:25] <wolverian> if I wanted to define my own sigil, would I add it to the grammar and then define its behaviour through a MOP? 

[21:26] <pmurias> "MOP" = Meta Object Protol ?

[21:27] <wolverian> yes

[21:27] <wolverian> might be the wrong name here

[21:27] <wolverian> I just mean an API 

[21:28] <pmurias> wolverian: i think it's unspeced
