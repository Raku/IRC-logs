[13:07] <masak> jauaor: sounds good.

[13:08] <masak> I must admit that my infatuation with Perl 5 is still pretty solid. but Perl 6 (in its idealized goal state) is indeed great.

[13:09] <jauaor> masak: I am mainly a Haskell programmer ... and I can see Perl 6 is taking quite a lot from it

[13:09] <masak> aye.

[13:10] <masak> though the two are still fairly different.

[14:26] <masak> indeed

[14:26] <masak> aye, seems I don't yet understand what little-endian means

[19:38] <pmurias> ruoso: do we plan on putting a git repository for integrating smop and p5 somewhere?

[19:42] <jauaor> pmurias: Because it lacks the dynamism offered by one .... and one or two line scripts are usually better in such a dynamic languages

[19:49] <jauaor> Though one language usually inclines more towards one paradigm than other ... it's always nice to have both options at hand

[19:57] <pmurias> i'm a young and noobish haskell coder but IMHO haskell feels much more like a dynamic language than say C

[19:57] <jauaor> And though it's fun and all, it isn't a scripting language ... so, using it like that won't give you as many benefits as one

[20:00] <lambdabot> Title: Paste #32990 from "rindolf" at 62.219.139.216

[20:01] <jauaor> And once you get used to its type system and laziness ... it's hard not to hate other languages :-P

[20:02] <jauaor> pmurias: aah right, from that point of view.. Haskell is by far more advanced than C .... not sure if it is a fair comparison considering the languages nature , but I understand what you say

[20:02] <jauaor> Haskell just spoils you in so many ways

[20:02] <jauaor> type system, laziness, type inference, infinite structures ....

[20:03] <jauaor> So it'd be really nice to have a scripting language inheriting some of this stuff

[20:05] <allbery_b> yopu can run uncompiled code with runhaskell. or one-liners with ghc -e

[20:05] *** simcop2387 joined
[20:05] <jauaor> yes you can

[20:05] <allbery_b> unfortunately, the nature of scripting is more or less opposed to strong typing

[20:06] <jauaor> And certainly ghci has improved greatly lately

[20:06] <jauaor> But at the end Haskell is more of a static language .. and it will be oriented toward it better

[20:07] <rindolf> Hmmm... works if I put it inside a script.

[20:07] <jauaor> For example allbery_b , you can't create data constructors straight from ghci

[20:08] <allbery_b> right

[20:08] <jauaor> So, that gives some kind of example of certain limitations ... 

[20:08] <allbery_b> arguably if you get to the point where you need custom data types, you're in runhaskell territory anyway

[20:08] <jauaor> For scripting or dynamic code

[20:08] <pmurias> scripting here being the sort of things you use can use shell scripts for

[20:08] <pmurias> s/use//

[20:09] <pmurias> or writing small plugins for complex applications?

[20:09] <rindolf> pugs: my $x = [5,63001,7]; @$x[1]

[20:09] <p6eval> pugs: RESULT[\63001]

[20:10] <nacho_> i think i will have to know pir before I get involved with rakudo test suite

[20:10] <jauaor> pmurias: Haskell can be used for shell code .... there have been many efforts to get a proper Haskell shell going on ... but none enough popular it seems

[20:11] <jauaor> pmurias: but you can certainly use it like that

[20:11] <jauaor> ther eis even libraries for shell routines as modules

[20:11] <jauaor> there are*

[20:12] <jauaor> pmurias: I usually care more about scripting languages for extending applications though

[20:14] <pmurias> static typing is create if the thing you're writing takes a while to test

[20:17] <pmurias> s/create/great/

[20:18] <pmurias> is svn.pugscode.org alive?

[20:19] <pmurias> sorry the https url wasn't working

[20:22] <jauaor> the http is working ... well, worked for me a few hours ago

[20:23] *** mberends joined
[20:23] <pmurias> the http works the https doesn't

[20:24] <rindolf> Hi all.

[20:24] <pmurias> rindolf: hi

[20:24] <rindolf> How do I add a test to the Rakudo test suite to test for @$array_ref[1]?

[20:24] <rindolf> I have the test written, but don't know where to put it.

[20:25] <pmurias> rindolf: why not add the test to the official Perl 6 test suite in pugs/t

[20:25] <pmurias> pugs/t/spec

[20:25] <rindolf> pmurias: ah.

[20:25] <rindolf> pmurias: can Rakudo fail initially?

[20:26] <pmurias> rindolf: i'm Rakudo ignorant

[20:26] <rindolf> pmurias: ah.

[20:27] <pmurias> jauor: the haskell->smop bindings in a way i can't understand and i'll have to rewrite them in a ugly OO perl5 way :(

[20:27] <pmurias> s/them/code that depends on them/

[20:34] *** crksht left
[20:34] <jauaor> pmurias: why?

[20:35] <pmurias> argh, i don't type all the words i mean too

[20:36] <pmurias> s/in a way/broke in a way/ ;)

[20:36] <jauaor> aaah ... hah

[20:36] <nacho_> rindolf, can you share what are you doing? :D

[20:36] <jauaor> pmurias: where are those bindings?

[20:36] <rindolf> nacho_: trying to get @$array_ref[1] to work.

[20:36] * jauaor is just getting into perl6 atm

[20:37] <rindolf> nacho_: it's for a script I wrote that works on Pugs.

[20:37] <pmurias> v6/smop/m0ld/M0ld/Eval.hs

[20:37] <pmurias> i encoutered some recent bitrot so i'll have to fix some things before smop compiles again

[20:37] *** kisu left
[20:40] <jauaor> aaah .. mm ... 

[20:42] *** kisu joined
[20:43] <nacho_> so, you are writing tests just for rakudo on pugs or pugs and parrot as well?

[20:43] <rindolf> nacho_: rakudo on pugs?

[20:43] <rindolf> nacho_: I'm trying to fix Rakudo.

[20:43] <rindolf> nacho_: but I like to do in Test-driven-development.

[20:44] <pmurias> jauaor: i used the gimme5 script which STD.pm uses to compile itself as a parser for the assembly language for a depraceated smop backend

[20:44] <pmurias> * deprecated

[20:44] <nacho_> ok, now I understand

[20:44] <nacho_> haha

[20:44] <pmurias> and mixing deprecated things with bleading edge stuff tends to break ;)

[20:48] <jauaor> pmurias: hah

[21:29] <ruoso> pmurias, re git branch: I was wondering if I should ask for a remote branch on the official p5 git repo

[21:34] * ruoso is dead tired... spent the whole day painting his new house...

[21:39] *** scrottie joined
[21:39] *** scrottie left
[21:46] <pmurias> ruoso: we could ask i'm not sure if commit bits are branch specific and how official is the stuff in the p5 git repo

[21:47] <spx2> is there something serious using perl6 running right now ?

[21:47] <spx2> like some project

[21:47] <spx2> or something

[21:47] <spx2> preferably non-web related

[21:47] <spx2> I mean non-web site cgi that kind of stuff

[21:48] <ruoso> pmurias, I see... maybe we could host a p5 git repo that could be sync'ed with the main repo

[21:48] <ruoso> and we keep our branch there

[21:49] <pmurias> i'm not familiar with git

[21:51] <ruoso> git is like svk, but better

[21:51] <ruoso> it doesn't depend on a master server at al

[21:51] <pmurias> used it for a tiny amount of time

[21:53] <pugs_svn> r22849 | pmurias++ | [smop] removed one use of SLIME

[21:53] <pmurias> ruoso: i'm removing slime/sm0p as it bitrotted and i don't won't to waste time fixing it again 

[21:54] <ruoso> pmurias, you just need to support the "free" operator before you can get rid of slime

[22:12] <ruoso> pmurias, note the above commit (just to avoid you doing the same thing)

[22:12] *** nacho_ left
[22:14] <pmurias> ruoso: more RIness is nice ;)

[22:15] <pmurias> ruoso: btw have you seen SMOP_HUNT_NULLS?

[22:15] <ruoso> no... I haven't... what is it?

[22:15] *** nacho_ joined
[22:17] <pmurias> it's an cpp flags which adds a test to SMOP_DISPATCH to check if a NULL is being returned

[22:19] <ruoso> cool
