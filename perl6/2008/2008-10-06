[02:15] <literal> there's lwall and larry?

[02:15] <TimToady> it ain't fair, is it...

[02:17] <Auzon> perlbot, karma TimToady

[02:17] <perlbot> Karma for TimToady: 194

[02:33] <TimToady> looks like I have some catching up to do with that lwall fellow...

[02:34] <Auzon> Yeah. It seems like he gets karma three times as often as you do :P

[02:34] <TimToady> maybe it's just because he has a famous name

[04:00] <Ontolog> moritz_: you mentioned a bug a couple weeks ago that would prevent me from returning a list of Match objects (or interspersed String and Match objects) from split(), is that still valid? If so, which bug is it?

[04:01] <Ontolog> moritz_: I've been AFK for a week but now I'm back and would like to get back to hacking some perl 6 stuff

[04:38] <wayland76> I also have a question.  If I have an array with 5 objects in it, and I have another variable which also points to the object, how do I find which array element contains the object that the other variable points at?

[04:48] *** sevz joined
[04:48] <TimToady> how often do you want to do it?

[04:49] <TimToady> if often, a reverse hash is the right way to do it

[04:50] <TimToady> if seldom, find the first element for which { $_ === $other } is true

[04:52] *** xuser joined
[05:00] <TimToady> (but no one implements hashes with object keys yet that I know of)

[05:00] <wayland76> Hmm.  Often, but with different arrays :).  I guess I use ===

[05:01] <wayland76> Well, I'm writing code that will target this hopefully-done-by-Christmas perl6 :)

[05:01] <wayland76> Do we do POD yet?  

[05:02] <wayland76> (at least, do we ignore it while compiling?

[05:02] <TimToady> generally, I think so

[05:03] <wayland76> Hmm.  Is there any doco on the POD then?  Because rakudo doesn't seem to be ignoring it

[05:03] <TimToady> well, STD ignores it

[05:03] <wayland76> Ok :)

[05:03] <TimToady> rakudo might be still expecting =cut instead of =end

[05:03] <wayland76> I'll put in an appropriate complaint then

[05:03] <wayland76> hmm. 

[05:04] <wayland76> well, I'm using =cut :)

[05:04] <literal> documentation: http://perlcabal.org/syn/S26.html

[05:04] <lambdabot> Title: S26

[05:04] <TimToady> try =begin/=end

[05:04] <wayland76> Oh, great :)

[05:05] <wayland76> Wow!  I was working off the old synopses on dev.perl.org :)

[05:05] <wayland76> So now I can help myself much better!  

[05:05] <wayland76> Thanks :)

[05:07] <TimToady> well, I gotta get up in 4.5 hours and catch a plane, so I'd better zzz off

[08:58] <wayland76> Does perl6 have a DBI module yet? :)

[09:01] <moritz_> no

[09:01] <moritz_> though in rakudo you can use the mysql NCI stuff

[09:01] <moritz_> but it's really ugly to work with it

[09:17] <moritz_> Tim Bunce said he'd write a DBI for Perl 6 (when it's "more done"), and get some inspiration from the odbc interfaces

[15:27] *** alanhaggai left
[15:28] <PerlJam> What?!?  They're moving November?  But I like it to be right after October and just before December.

[15:29] <[particle]> it's a wiki. if they move it, you can move it back ;)

[15:32] <masak> haha

[15:33] <masak> moritz_: slowly. 100% studies is a pain for hobby development. :)

[15:33] <masak> but the things that do happen are cool

[15:33] <moritz_> masak: I know that feeling ;(

[15:33] <masak> I spent the weekend teaching zarah the Bioclipse bot new tricks

[15:34] <masak> so almost all the free hacking time went to that

[15:34] <masak> moritz_: ping me at #november-wiki and I'll show you the new tricks :)

[15:35] <moritz_> masak: so teaching buts stuff is what you call "study"?

[15:35] <moritz_> ;-)

[15:35] <masak> er.

[16:10] <masak> by me and ihrd, respectively

[16:10] <moritz_> for me a "tag" is something like <body> or <code>

[16:10] <moritz_> I like the term "label" better

[16:17] <masak> thing is, I don't have nearly enough Parrot-fu to do anything about it myself

[16:18] <masak> as far as I know, it's pmichaud++'s department

[16:18] <masak> so the only thing I can do is to nag pmichaud

[16:18] <moritz_> as far as I know, pmichaud would be very happy to delegate the issue to somebody else ;)

[16:18] <masak> it's not that... I don't know where to begin

[16:18] *** Tene_ is now known as Tene

[16:18] <masak> it seems like an architectural issue

[16:19] <moritz_> yes, that's what I'm talking about

[16:19] <masak> the flaw is in Parrot's lexicals handling, or pads handling, or whatever

[16:20] <moritz_> right

[16:22] <pmichaud> I've been complaining about lexicals handling for a year or so :-|

[16:22] *** mberends joined
[16:22] <pmichaud> the only reason it's my department is because nobody else seems to prioritize it to fix it

[16:23] <masak> oh.

[16:23] <masak> pmichaud: I'd do it, but I don't have the required skillz.

[16:23] <pmichaud> so I've basically said "well, looks like it's up to me then".

[16:23] <masak> pmichaud: any reading-up I can do, stuff like PDDs or source code?

[16:23] <pmichaud> masak:  I was in the same boat -- I ended up spending a good bit of my summer studying the problem and figuring out how to solve it

[16:24] <masak> pmichaud: this problem? or some other problem?

[16:24] <pmichaud> lexicals.

[16:24] <masak> seems like we need one more summer, then :)

[16:24] <pmichaud> heh

[16:24] <pmichaud> well, fortunately my time availability isn't that seasonal

[16:25] <pmichaud> I think I have a solution, but I was kinda waiting for the mmd branch to merge before making too big an investment in code

[16:25] <pmichaud> since that's happened (yesterday), I may be able to focus on it now.  the 74 spectest_regression failures bug me a bit, though.

[16:25] <moritz_> are they all related to complex math?

[16:25] <masak> 74, oy

[16:25] <pmichaud> not all, but most.

[16:26] <pmichaud> Parrot doesn't seem to be able to handle subclasses of its built-in Complex PMC

[16:26] <masak> pmichaud: nice to hear that a fix is not impossibly far away, in any case. as an application programmer, I kinda like recursion.

[16:26] <masak> it's convenient.

[16:26] <pmichaud> masak: yes, I totally understand how recursion is important (especially for parsing issues :-)

[16:27] <masak> aye

[16:27] <pmichaud> I did wake up this morning thinking "I feel like working on lexicals today."

[16:39] <azawawi> moritz_: i need to put some NCI shared lib code for $*PID and others; where is the ideal place to put these stuff in our perl6 src directory?

[16:40] <moritz_> azawawi: dunno. I've never messed with NCI so far.

[16:40] <moritz_> azawawi: in case of doubt, discuss with pmichaud

[16:41] <moritz_> that said, do you really think that's necessary?

[16:41] <azawawi> hmmm parrot does not seem to have an op code to get the process id

[16:41] <pmichaud> azawawi: I'd prefer to ask the question "what's the standard Parrot mechanism to get the process id" than to immediately jump to NCI code

[16:42] <azawawi> cool

[16:42] <azawawi> but we should have a place to put util nci code for the future

[16:42] <azawawi> things that parrot does not implement

[16:43] <pmichaud> I agree there.

[16:43] <pmichaud> My guess is that pid code would go into Parrot's OS PMC

[20:16] <ruoso> if a multi sub is defined in more than one package as "is export", do the different versions merge as different options or is that an error?

[20:17] <ruoso> this has an important side-effect...

[20:17] <ruoso> putting it another way...

[20:18] <ruoso> are all the multi options stored inside an object that is then held in the variable space for that name?

[20:19] <ruoso> or does the multi dispatch means finding for another variables in the lexical scope that might provide the proper multi option

[20:20] <ruoso> or putting it in yet another way...

[20:20] <ruoso> is it possible to add a lexically-scoped-variant to a multi sub?

[20:28] <ruoso> pugs seems to implement the multi dispatch by continuing the traversing of the lexical scope if not variant is found...

[20:29] <PerlJam> ruoso: I'd guess that a lexically scoped multi should be possible.

[20:29] <ruoso> yeah... it seems so...

[20:30] <ruoso> so the sub dispatch actually is something like dispatch($name, $lexpad)\

[20:30] <ruoso> which means that finding the sub is not a normal variable lookup...

[20:30] <ruoso> but this is not really a problem...
