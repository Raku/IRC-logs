[02:04] <TimToady> @tell cosimo when you add a new file you want to run util/add-svn-props.sh on it; also, don't be afraid to use "svn mv" rather than "svn cp" or we'll end up with a lot of dupes...

[02:04] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[03:03] <mncharity> hi pmurias.  re how is the backend progressing?, no so much.  literally nothing yet.   weekend went a different way.  hoping for an hour or so later today, but that will be it.  maybe mid/late next week.  i will commit early/often. :/

[03:27] <pugs_svn> r19460 | putter++ | [kp6] ruby backend project, first checkin.

[03:27] <pugs_svn> r19460 | putter++ | Emit/Ruby.pm is simply a copy of Emit/Perl5.pm.

[03:27] <pugs_svn> r19460 | putter++ | docs/ruby_backend.txt has a bare-bones todo list.

[03:29] <mncharity> so at least if anyone else wants to work on it, there's something there.  next step is to tell script/kp6 there's a new backend, which anyone could do.

[14:03] <pmurias> module don't have a prototype object, do they? (changing kp6)

[14:04] <pmurias> * modules

[14:06] <ruoso> pmurias, If they're accessible as objects, they must...

[14:07] <pmurias> ruoso: example please?

[14:08] <pmurias> an prototype for a module would be an undefined module instance, and i suppose only classes can have instances

[14:13] <ruoso> pmurias, can you create a module dinamically?

[14:13] <ruoso> I think so

[14:14] <ruoso> where do you call new, if not in the prototype?
