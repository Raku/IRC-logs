[04:30] <pugs_svn> r21604 | lwall++ | .** isn't a valid regex

[04:30] <pugs_svn> r21605 | lwall++ | [STD] fix angle parsing problems

[04:31] * Auzon doesn't know where he got .** from instead of .+

[04:31] <TimToady> I changed it to .**2, but feel free to change it

[04:32] <Auzon> The actual regex wasn't important, I don't think.

[04:32] <TimToady> well, you don't want it to match as a string is the main thing

[04:32] <Auzon> Yeah, so pretty much anything with a metacharacter is good

[04:33] <Auzon> hm, except /.+/ would match '.+'

[04:33] <TimToady> nodnod

[04:33] <Auzon> Thanks for catching it, TimToady++

[04:33] <TimToady> anyway, it parses now :)

[04:34] * TimToady blames STD

[04:34] <Auzon> Speaking of parsing, I'll give tryfile a try now

[04:34] <TimToady> well, the test also found some STD bugs, to be sure

[04:34] <TimToady> didn't have the foggiest idea how to parse <::(...)>

[04:35] <TimToady> as it is, ::() is rather ambiguous in the standard grammar

[04:35] <TimToady> is it a symbolic reference, or a cast to :: sigil type?

[04:36] <TimToady> which might be a good reason for not consiring :: a sigil...

[04:36] <Auzon> My use quoted S05 claiming that it was a symbolic reference

[04:36] <TimToady> *considering

[04:36] <TimToady> I think that's how people would usually think of it in that context

[04:37] <TimToady> though <."$ref"()> would probably be clearer

[04:37] <TimToady> maybe that's an argument for ::"$name" instead of ::($name) though

[04:41] <Auzon> I wonder how long it'd take to run tryfile on all of t.

[04:41] <Auzon> well, t/spec first.

[04:41] <TimToady> it's faster than it used to be, and not fast enough :)

[04:42] <Auzon> Is that what you're doing (running it against all files)?

[04:42] <TimToady> make test compiles STD.pm and t/spec

[04:42] <TimToady> takes on the order of 20 minutes on my machine

[04:43] <Auzon> ah, cool.

[04:43] <TimToady> but I haven't timeed it exactly.

[04:43] <TimToady> my goal is for STD to compile itself roughly at the same speed that gimme5 does, but that's gonna be a while yet...

[04:43] <TimToady> need about a 120x speedup for that

[04:44] <Auzon> What does STD do when it encounters a new operator definition?

[04:44] <TimToady> nothing currently

[04:44] <TimToady> it calls .add_macro which does nothing yet

[04:44] *** pen1 joined
[04:45] <TimToady> I cheated on postfix:<!>

[04:45] <Auzon> No fair ;)

[04:45] *** penk left
[04:45] <TimToady> pmurias was thinking about working on the macros though

[04:45] <TimToady> and then it would use the definition in the test

[04:45] <TimToady> one of the remaining failures is due to lack of infix:<>

[04:46] <Auzon> Isn't that just nothing?

[04:46] <TimToady> STD compiles itself in 3 minutes with a full cache rebuild, and in 2 minutes with a loaded cache

[04:47] <ingy> speed killz

[04:47] <TimToady> would like to get in the ballpark of a second, but it's already good enough for correctness testing

[04:47] <TimToady> but that'll take a real dfa engine dedicated to doing p6 regex fast

[04:48] <TimToady> Cursor spends far too much time babysitting TRE at the moment

[04:48] <ingy> :)

[04:48] <ingy> someone should fix tre
