[00:07] <Hinrik> are Perl 6 punctuation vars ($/, $!, $¢) always lexicals?

[00:08] <Hinrik> and $_ ...

[00:16] <[particle]> hinrik: yes, see S02:1611

[00:27] <jnthn> If any November developers can try out the latest rakudoreg and let me know how it goes, that'd be wonderful.

[00:28] *** dukeleto joined
[00:54] <[particle]> http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?a_guide_to_the_pugs_repository_for_rakudo_hackers

[00:55] <[particle]> i'll do a lightning talk on this page tonight

[00:55] <jnthn> [particle]: Cool, where at?

[00:55] <[particle]> seattle.pm

[00:55] <[particle]> it's always third tuesday, so i get to make announcements about new releases :)

[00:55] <pmichaud> note that on unix boxes rakudo hackers can just "make t/spec" to check out a copy of the tests

[00:56] <[particle]> pmichaud: can do that on win32 as well, but only to check out, not to update

[00:56] <pmichaud> huh?

[00:56] <pmichaud> there's a difference?

[00:56] <[particle]> yes, if t\spec exists, it won't run svn up

[00:56] <pmichaud> oh.

[00:56] <pmichaud> sure, after that can do   svn up t/spec

[00:57] <jnthn> Thankfully, if you make spectest it does update.

[00:57] <jnthn> For me, anyway.

[00:57] <pmichaud> but there's no need for a _separate_ copy of the t/spec repository if people want to update tests

[00:57] <jnthn> I just let make spectest check it out

[00:57] <pmichaud> (yes, need a separate copy to move tests from t/ to t/spec)

[00:57] <jnthn> And then commit directly from taht copy.

[00:57] <pmichaud> right, same here.

[00:58] <pmichaud> maybe we should provide a make target to grab a copy of the synopses, too.

[00:58] <jnthn> Oooh, I'd like that.

[00:58] <jnthn> Especially as I'm going to be hacking on 'em soon...

[00:58] <[particle]> good idea

[00:59] <[particle]> it'd be nice to have STD.pm as well

[00:59] <pmichaud> yes, we could grab that too.

[00:59] <[particle]> which are the three reasons i keep a pugs repo around :)

[00:59] *** yjh joined
[01:00] <pmichaud> [particle]: what's youre feeling/expectation about 'make install' for parrot?

[01:00] <pmichaud> *your

[01:00] <[particle]> docs/spec/S*.pod and src/grammar/STD.pm?

[01:00] <pmichaud> I'd probably grab docs/spec and (maybe) src/grammar/

[01:00] <pmichaud> I don't know that svn works well at checking out single files

[01:00] <[particle]> svn 1.5 does

[01:01] <[particle]> and i'm suggesting those dirs for rakudo, in pugs they're differently named

[01:01] <jnthn> I'd rather not have STD.pm under source - it's a tad confusing.

[01:01] <[particle]> i'm afraid make install will slip, for lack of hands

[01:01] <[particle]> but i'll know better after talking to rurban

[01:02] <[particle]> jnthn: it will be source after pge/pct/rakudo fixes

[01:02] <jnthn> Especially since we'll have a STD.pm of our own that is converging on the one inf the Pugs repo at some point.

[01:02] <pmichaud> STD.pm from pugs would be in a different directory, yes.

[01:02] <pmichaud> I'll work it out.

[01:02] <[particle]> sure.

[01:02] <pmichaud> [particle]: I think "make isntall" is one of those things that mustn't slip.

[01:02] <pmichaud> it's far more important than the things that slipped dec release.

[01:02] <[particle]> i agree

[01:03] <[particle]> that's why it's marked 'critical'

[01:03] <[particle]> we hold the release if it doesn't get done

[01:03] <pmichaud> we hold the jan release?

[01:03] <[particle]> that's my feeling now, yes.

[01:03] <pmichaud> okay, I can agree with that.

[01:03] <pmichaud> I'm wondering if this is something that I should go ahead and devote some tuits to.

[01:04] <pmichaud> in conjunction with planning for moving rakudo to its own repo.

[01:04] <jnthn> I can probably give it some time on Win32.

[01:05] <jnthn> But I'm not at all knowledgable on how it should look anywhere else (heck, I'm not that hot on how it should look on Win32...)

[01:05] <pmichaud> it might mean that I'd slip a bit on PGE stuff, but being in a "install limbo" is not going to be good for rakudo this month.

[01:05] <pmichaud> I _really_ think we're going to have a lot of people looking at rakudo in the next few weeks, especially with holidays

[01:05] <pmichaud> and recent events

[01:05] <pmichaud> and recent new features

[01:05] <[particle]> we *absolutely* *must* have 1 release after make install and before 1.0

[01:06] <pmichaud> correct

[01:06] <[particle]> i may not take my laptop home for the holidays

[01:06] <[particle]> which would be bad for parrot, but good for me

[01:06] <jnthn> Getting a good break matters.

[01:07] <pmichaud> correct.

[01:07] <jnthn> (FWIW, I will certinly be mostly offline Fri-Mon, visiting friends and relatives in the UK.)

[01:08] *** Ferran is now known as FerranZzZz

[01:08] <pmichaud> how do your schedules look after the 25th?  (the week of the 29th?)

[01:10] <jnthn> I expect I'd be about a bit in the days immediately before and immediately after Christmas, hard to be sure.

[01:10] <jnthn> Week starting 29th...

[01:10] <jnthn> I'm back in Slovakia, but have some family visiting.

[01:10] <pmichaud> okay.

[01:11] <jnthn> They'll want some attention, but from the last time they visited me they will like to spend some time wandering around themselves a bit too.

[01:11] <jnthn> Plus they're not late night people so much.

[01:11] <jnthn> So I expect I'll be about a bit.

[01:11] <pmichaud> okay.

[01:11] <[particle]> i'll be back on the 28th, but should have an 8h power outage the 29th

[01:11] <pmichaud> I expect to be around most of the time, unless we decide to take a trip somewhere.

[01:12] *** alanhaggai__ joined
[01:12] <pmichaud> but Paula has gotten very canny about asking about trips these days.  "Can we take a trip to <cool place XYZ>?  They have high-speed internet available."

[01:12] <jnthn> lol!

[01:12] <jnthn> Oslo! Oslo! ;-)

[01:12] <[particle]> i have to head to seattle.pm now &

[01:12] <pmichaud> have fun, particle

[01:12] <jnthn> have fun

[01:13] <pmichaud> be sure to highlight all of the really cool things that got added to rakudo this week

[01:13] <[particle]> ta! i'll write that lightning talk over beer :)

[01:13] <pmichaud> hyperops!  reduce ops!  better sorts!  given/when!

[01:13] <pmichaud> .assuming!

[01:13] <pmichaud> also point out the twitter feed:  http://twitter.com/rakudoperl

[01:14] <[particle]> wilco, bye &

[01:15] <jnthn> pmichaud: I may have got the branch working enough for November.

[01:15] <jnthn> Need testing.

[01:15] <jnthn> If so, I'm inclined to merge tomorrow.

[01:15] <pmichaud> jnthn: I saw the backscroll comments.  So, it was about like I had said it would be, eh?  ;-)

[01:16] <jnthn> I uncommented two lines and it worked. ;-)

[01:16] <pmichaud> which was kinda what I was expecting.  I didn't understand why it "wasn't working".

[01:16] *** alanhaggai__ is now known as alanhaggai

[01:16] <jnthn> To be fair, at the time I did that, I'm not sure the use sub had the check on %*INC to make sure we didn't load multiple times a module.

[01:17] <pmichaud> it did.

[01:17] <jnthn> Oh?

[01:17] <jnthn> OK.

[01:17] <jnthn> It probably woulda worked then. ;-)

[01:17] <pmichaud> the check has been there since summer.

[01:17] <jnthn> Fine. I suck. :-)

[01:18] <pmichaud> not really -- it's just I actually got ahead of you for one brief moment, I think.  :-)

[01:19] <jnthn> There's one thing that I don't like about what I've done.

[01:19] <jnthn> Which is that if we put a load of stubs in, and then just leave 'em in the namespace and rely on Parrot to do the Right Thing and replace them, it doesn't work out.

[01:20] <pmichaud> you mean stubs for subs?  or something else?

[01:20] <jnthn> So I keep a list of the things I stick in, and then iterate it and they know how to clean themselves up.

[01:20] <jnthn> stubs for types

[01:20] <jnthn> stubs for subs I haven't tried yet.

[01:20] <pmichaud> why is that a problem?

[01:20] <jnthn> I didn't get to the bottom of why.

[01:20] <jnthn> It was...odd.

[01:20] <pmichaud> why is it a problem to leave them in the namespace?

[01:20] <pmichaud> I'm confused.

[01:20] <jnthn> If you leave them in the NS

[01:21] <jnthn> Then when the loadinit stuff runs, you'd expect it just to replace the stuff in the namespace already.

[01:21] <jnthn> That didn't happen.

[01:21] <pmichaud> do you mean the stubs for the protoobjects?

[01:21] <jnthn> It did...bizzare stuff.

[01:21] <jnthn> Yes.

[01:21] <jnthn> Well, I have one stub object that represents any type-ish thing for now.

[01:21] <pmichaud> right.

[01:22] <jnthn> I was going to crate a bunch of different ones, and then realized they'd all be the same.

[01:22] <pmichaud> but it shouldn't matter, because P6object rebinds the symbol to the proto when it creates it.

[01:22] <jnthn> At least, for now.

[01:22] <jnthn> Right, that's what I thought.

[01:22] <jnthn> Well, it's very easy to reproduce what does happen and debug it.

[01:22] <jnthn> Well, it's easy to reproduce it.

[01:22] <jnthn> Debugging it was harder.

[01:23] <pmichaud> okay.

[01:23] <jnthn> (Basically, comment out the 3 lines that loops and cleans.)

[01:23] <pmichaud> I can look at that tomorrow morning.

[01:23] <jnthn> Anyway, I broke re-entrancy by putting that in (which I knew it would).

[01:23] <jnthn> I put in a hack for now.

[01:23] <jnthn> But really I want to toss this.

[01:23] <jnthn> As in, the whole cleaning up thing.

[01:23] <jnthn> Because I don't think we should have to do it really.

[01:24] <pmichaud> I don't think we should either.  The fact that we seem to need to do so means we're misunderstanding something somewhere.

[01:24] <jnthn> Or Parrot is br0ken.

[01:24] <pmichaud> that's possible too.

[01:24] <jnthn> .oO( NO IT COUDN'T BE. )

[01:25] <jnthn> Well, we've already discovered one curiosity this week about Parrot namespaces. :-)

[01:25] <pmichaud> maybe p6object should have a 'new_stub' method. :-)

[01:25] <jnthn> I doubt it's that I'm putting the things in the wrong place.

[01:26] <jnthn> Since then I'd expect the tyename stuff to break in the case of a use. And it doesn't.

[01:26] <pmichaud> right.

[01:26] <jnthn> (Plus that woudln't make sense anyway...)

[01:26] <jnthn> What I do fear is that

[01:26] <pmichaud> when are you feeling ready to merge back to trunk -- any blockers?

[01:26] <jnthn> Well, I want to hear from November if I broke it.

[01:26] <pmichaud> okay.

[01:27] <jnthn> If you're OK with us dealing with working out why we need the cleanup and removing it later, after the merge, I'm OK to do it after that.

[01:27] <jnthn> As in, after I know November is OK.

[01:27] <pmichaud> I think I'm okay with that -- I'm with you, I'd like verification that November is still okay.

[01:27] <pmichaud> so we're in agreement.

[01:27] <jnthn> OK.

[01:28] <pmichaud> we can merge whenever you're comfortable.

[01:28] <jnthn> So long as you know that I want that code to go away too, so you don't see it and think "OMG HE DID WHAT?" :-)

[01:28] <pmichaud> no problem. :-)

[01:28] *** alanhaggai_ left
[01:28] *** armagad joined
[01:28] <jnthn> Oh, we have to lose about 20 passing tests when we merge too.

[01:28] <pmichaud> ouch.

[01:29] <jnthn> A bunch in assign.t test want.

[01:29] <jnthn> Which we ain't implemented.

[01:29] <pmichaud> oh, but they're "fake passes", yes.

[01:29] <jnthn> Thing is, we were running a load that didn't explode (and even looked to give a correct result).

[01:29] <pmichaud> i.e., they aren't really passing, they just happen to give results that look like a pass.

[01:29] <jnthn> Right.

[01:29] <pmichaud> I don't have a problem with losing those.

[01:30] <jnthn> I investigated how they'd possibly worked before, which was vaguely hilarious...

[01:30] <pmichaud> I know there is some non-zero percentage of those in the suite.  Regressing on a "fake pass" isn't really a regression imo.

[01:30] <jnthn> I've got a patch already that cleans them up, so I'll put it into t/spec before merging.

[01:30] <jnthn> So so you know we'll drop some.

[01:30] <pmichaud> that's fine.

[01:30] <jnthn> But we'll then be able to pass tests with lowercase class/subset/enum names. ;-)

[01:30] <pmichaud> I'm interested in accurate numbers more than "constantly increasing"

[01:31] <pmichaud> and if it helps us get rid of the   ~~ Grammar::regex   stuff, I'm _all_ for it :-)

[01:31] <jnthn> Oh, that *will* break now.

[01:31] <pmichaud> good.

[01:31] <pmichaud> KILL IT DEAD AND FLING IT INTO SPACE SO FAR WE CAN'T FIND IT WITH A RADIO TELESCOPE.

[01:32] <pmichaud> ahem.

[01:32] <jnthn> I won't be surprised if we still get at RT ticket complaining it broke. ;-)

[01:32] <pmichaud> "I'll be happy when it breaks."

[01:33] <pmichaud> I'll forward the ticket to p6l and say ... "uh, how is this supposed to work, exactly?"  ;-)

[01:33] <jnthn> Didn't you already ask p6l about that one? ;-)

[01:33] <pmichaud> yes.

[01:33] <pmichaud> I think I did.  I know I asked in a p6 design meeting and got a "I'm still working that out" response.

[01:33] <pmichaud> which is actually okay with me for the moment.  It's not an easy call.

[01:34] <pmichaud> and we do have the /<Grammar::foo>/ workaround for now.

[01:34] <jnthn> Yes

[01:34] <jnthn> If there's wasn't that way to do it, I'm be much more bothered.

[01:34] <jnthn> But that's still pretty compact.

[01:34] <pmichaud> unfortunatley, I think STD.pm may actually be calling it /<Grammar.foo>/  now.

[01:34] <jnthn> Oh, hmm.

[01:35] <pmichaud> <Grammar::foo> syntax is apparently gone from S05, and the only thing remaining is an obscure reference to <Grammar.foo> (and the fact that STD.pm apparently parses the :: funny in angles)

[01:35] <pmichaud> I'll still wait for something "official-ish"

[01:35] <jnthn> I need to look at what STD.pm's latest decree is on parametric role stuff.

[01:36] <jnthn> I'm also pondering traits and what we pass.

[01:36] <jnthn> There doesn't seem to be a list anywhere.

[01:36] <jnthn> But that's a whole other bunch of fun.

[01:37] <jnthn> Got approval to work on S14, anyway.

[01:38] <pmichaud> I was pretty sure you would.

[01:38] <pmichaud> I'm glad you're doing it :-)

[01:38] <jnthn> There's some quite hard/tricky questions that come up when you dig into the parametric roles stuff.

[01:39] <pmichaud> I

[01:39] <pmichaud> I've noticed you have a knack for being able to bring the tricky questions into understandable terms, though.

[01:39] <jnthn> I'm sure the types guys on p6l will find plenty of things to say to my proposed answers...

[01:39] <jnthn> I do expect that I'll end up getting some stuff into S14 on types that wants later to be moved elsewhere too.

[01:40] <pmichaud> refactoring is okay.

[01:40] <jnthn> You know how we do the hack on the Num proto at the moment for ACCEPTS, for example?

[01:40] <pmichaud> yes.

[01:40] <jnthn> I want to formalize how you do that.

[01:40] <jnthn> So you can do something like will typecheck { ... } on the class

[01:40] <pmichaud> okay.  If it can be cleanly formalized, that is.  We want to be careful not to constrain implementations unnecessarily.

[01:40] <jnthn> Well, we need a way to express it in Perl 6.

[01:41] <jnthn> Consider we wrote

[01:41] <jnthn> sub foo(Int @x) { ... }

[01:41] <jnthn> Which of these calls should work out?

[01:41] <jnthn> my Int @a = 1,2,3; foo(@a);

[01:41] <jnthn> my @a = 1,2,3; foo(@a);

[01:41] <jnthn> I think _both_.

[01:42] <pmichaud> I think both also.

[01:42] <jnthn> In the first, we can go to the array and say "OK, you're parameterized, but what on?"

[01:42] <jnthn> And it answers "Int" and we know it's good.

[01:43] <jnthn> In the second case, it says "well, Any".

[01:43] <pmichaud> (Object, I think)

[01:43] *** Limbic_Region joined
[01:43] <jnthn> Yes.

[01:43] <jnthn> Object.

[01:43] <jnthn> I had exactly that thought experiemnt earlier and realized it had to be Object. :-)

[01:43] <jnthn> Anyway, the point is, not Int or something that Int accepts.

[01:43] <pmichaud> right.

[01:44] <jnthn> And it seems to me that the way that a parametric type checks if the incoming set of data conforms is custom per type.

[01:44] <jnthn> For arrays, we look at the values. For hashes, we look at the values, and maybe the keys. For your own weird and wonderful parametric type, well, who knows what matters.

[01:44] <pmichaud> I would say that since the array itself didn't conform, we check the elements.... right

[01:45] <jnthn> But I don't think we can know what to look at.

[01:45] <jnthn> That is, in the general case.

[01:45] <pmichaud> isn't the general case just array, scalar, or hash?

[01:46] <jnthn> No, because you can make your own parametric type.

[01:46] <pmichaud> you mean   @a is ...   ?

[01:46] <jnthn> sub foo(MyThingy[Int] $x) { ... }

[01:46] <pmichaud> isn't that just doing a   MyThingy[Int].ACCEPTS($x)   ?

[01:47] <jnthn> Yes, exactly, but how do we define that ACCEPTS?

[01:47] <pmichaud> on the parametric type, yes?

[01:47] <jnthn> Yes. That's what I'm getting at here. We want a way to be able to define the ACCEPTS.

[01:48] <jnthn> And if we work it out as a general mechanism, we can use the same thing to have a way in the prelude of saying, in Perl 6, that Num accepts Int even though it's not just a subtype.

[01:48] <pmichaud> got it.

[01:48] <pmichaud> yes, that might work out well.

[01:48] <pmichaud> but if nothing else, we just define Num.ACCEPTS and call it a day :-)

[01:49] <jnthn> Well, we do that now, yes.

[01:50] <pmichaud> "we want a way to be able to define the ACCEPTS" sounds a lot like "class Num is also { method ACCEPTS ... }"   :-)

[01:50] <pmichaud> but yes, I understand where you're coming from. 

[01:50] <jnthn> No

[01:50] <jnthn> Becuase that puts it on class itself

[01:50] <jnthn> _not_ the proto.

[01:50] <jnthn> That's the point here. We want ACCEPTS on the proto overridden.

[01:50] <pmichaud> yes.

[01:50] <pmichaud> okay, got it.

[01:50] <jnthn> Or on the "role proto".

[01:50] <jnthn> However that is going to look.

[01:51] <pmichaud> yeah, I'm thinking role.

[01:51] <pmichaud> anyway, I see where you're going -- it looks like a good direction to me.

[01:51] <jnthn> Essentially though, I realized that if we take the body of a role package

[01:51] <jnthn> And then we wrap it up in an outer sub, which is a multi-method taking the parameters

[01:52] <jnthn> And this sub then returns the inner block, having cloned it (thus making a closure)

[01:52] <jnthn> Then we pretty much get the type parameterization falling straight out of plain old closures and multiple dispatch.

[01:52] <pmichaud> yes.

[01:53] <jnthn> The only slighlty tricky bit might be making sure we end up putting into the class the methods referring to the correct outer.

[01:53] <jnthn> That's remaining on my "to solve" list.

[01:54] <pmichaud> I need a short break, then to come back and blog about this past week.

[01:54] <jnthn> *nod*

[01:54] <pmichaud> it's been quite a week.

[01:54] <jnthn> I need sleep real soon too.

[01:54] <jnthn> Yes!

[01:55] <pmichaud> anyway, I'll bbl.  see you tomorrow if not before then.

[01:55] <jnthn> Suggested blog post title: "And now we have some more presents under the Christmas tree" ;-)

[01:55] <pmichaud> heh

[01:55] <jnthn> I am totally not responsible for suggesting it. ;-)

[01:55] <pmichaud> I got a small amount of flamage here for my other title.

[01:55] <jnthn> I noticed. :-)

[01:55] <pmichaud> fortunately, I have a flame-resistant ego.

[01:56] <jnthn> Hey, we have to celebrate our achievements somehow...

[01:56] <jnthn> Anyway, see you tomorrow, most likely.

[01:56] <jnthn> Will be rakudo-daying.

[01:56] <pmichaud> later

[08:42] <moritz_> try #perl or #perlhelp

[08:44] <moritz_> you're not the first one complaining about #perl, but trying random channels with perl in the name isn't best pratice either

[08:44] <moritz_> there's also irc.perl.org with lots of perl channels

[08:44] <TACPILOT> I'll look else where

[08:45] <TACPILOT> in genral you see what I need, any suggestions other than go read a book before I go ?

[17:28] <moritz_> run the pbc

[17:28] <jnthn> Oh. :-|

[17:29] <moritz_> and when I close the REPL, I get such a backtrace again

[17:30] <jnthn> Ah. Hmm.

[17:30] <jnthn> I suspect it's an underlying Parrot issue. But if we get it from the PBC too, it's not the usual problem with the fake executable.

[17:30] <moritz_> and yes, it's the same backtrace as t/spec/S12-class/declaration-order.t

[17:31] *** alexn_org left
[17:31] <jnthn> Ah, OK

[17:31] <jnthn> we have a ticket to track the declaration-order.t problem.

[17:32] <jnthn> So I don't think we need to re-open the one on eval 'class C is D { }'

[17:32] <jnthn> As it's the same underlying Parrot issue in both.

[17:33] <moritz_> I've just replied... maybe they should be merged

[20:20] <jnthn> moritz_: If you life, I just realized I didn't do any tests with an array on the LHS/RHS instead of a list. Could be worth adding.

[20:26] <jnthn> moritz_: That's correct.

[20:26] <[particle]> what bug?

[20:26] <[particle]> :)

[20:26] <moritz_> human stupidity, not bugs ;-)

[20:27] <moritz_> [particle]: I primarily pursue tests, and only secondarily bugs

[20:29] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[20:29] <eric256> hehe

[20:30] <eric256> masak: feel free. i'm not even sure if its a but or not ;)

[20:31] <eric256> when do you submit a rakudobug versus just building a test?

[20:32] <moritz_> eric256: gut feeling ;-)

[20:32] <pugs_svn> r24452 | moritz++ | [t/spec] tests for Array ~~ Array

[20:32] <moritz_> eric256: when I think something should be implemented by now, I open a ticket (*and* write a test)

[20:32] <jnthn> eric256: You do both. And you say in the ticket, where you added the tests.

[20:32] <moritz_> eric256: when I know it's just not yet implemented, I just write the test, usually

[20:32] <jnthn> This makes the implementers Very Happy because they then know where to go un-fudging. :-)

[20:33] <jnthn> (Of course auto-unfudge catches stuff too, but I don't like comitting a fix without knowing there's a test.)

[20:33] <eric256> is that the same bug list as where you send patches?

[20:33] <moritz_> eric256: aye

[20:35] <eric256> docs don't seem to care where * is used.. very odd new operator ;) fits the perl mentality though i think 1..* is the same as 1,2,3,...till whenever i stop asking for mroe ;)

[20:36] <[particle]> and 1..^* is only slightly different :)

[20:36] <masak> eric256: technically, it's a term, not an operator. (I think.)

[20:36] <masak> [particle]: :P

[20:37] <jnthn> * is like, whatever.

[20:39] <masak> thought we had them by now.

[20:40] <masak> we have so many features nowadays, I can't quite keep them apart. :)

[20:40] <jnthn> masak: The lack of a complete/approved iterators spec is rather a holdup for us.

[20:40] <masak> ah.

[20:40] <moritz_> there was a branch, back in the auld days...

[20:40] <jnthn> I started a branch.

[20:40] <jnthn> But the spec is too fluid to make it worth spending a lot of time on yet, IMO.

[20:40] <masak> mm.

[20:41] <moritz_> and right now there are many other important things to work on

[20:41] <jnthn> Once there's a spec, I'm sure Rakudo won't be too far behind with starting to implement it.

[20:41] <masak> I've been in a state of incredulous bliss ever since the closing of #58392.

[20:41] <masak> nothing really compares to that bug.

[20:41] <moritz_> was that the (in)famous lex thing?

[20:41] <masak> aye.

[20:42] <masak> moritz_: I even got you crying that bug number out the window.

[20:42] <moritz_> and then we got list assignment and some meta ops just a few days or weeks after

[20:42] <masak> yes, crazy.

[20:42] <moritz_> ready for $today+1week

[20:43] <moritz_> F*CK, IT'S JUST ONE WEEK?

[20:43] <jnthn> What?

[20:43] <jnthn> Ouch!

[20:43] <masak> ihrd++ has merged the new-html-template branch into master now, thanks to the lexbug being fixed.

[20:43] <masak> moritz_: it is. that's crazy too.

[20:46] <eric256> so how long till we have a perl6 prelude like pugs has?

[20:46] <masak> eric256: there have been preparations for it.

[20:47] <masak> I don't remember what things remain to make it possible. but 'class A is also' was one of the things needed.

[20:47] <masak> (and Rakudo has that now, IIRC.)

[20:51] <eric256> just curious cuase there are tickets from a year ago relating to it ;) wondered what 12 months had gotten on that front

[20:52] <PerlJam> eric256: deja vu.  I asked about that yesterday I think.

[20:52] <[particle]> inline pir was also required and has been implemented, as well as 'is export'

[20:52] <moritz_> [particle]: do we have a prelude scope?

[20:52] <masak> jnthn and pmichaud are probably the ones sitting on the most current information.

[20:52] <[particle]> not yet

[20:52] <[particle]> masak is correct

[20:52] <PerlJam> eric256: grep the logs from #parrot or #perl6 from yesterday for "prelude" and I bet you'll find pmichaud's reply

[20:52] <moritz_> well, for methods that's not needed anyway

[20:53] <eric256> i guess a more important question would be..is rakudos goal to eventualy be a perl6 implementation written in perl?

[20:53] *** adc_penner joined
[20:53] <[particle]> no.

[20:53] <masak> no?

[20:53] <[particle]> rakudo's goal is to be a perl 6 implementation written for parrot

[20:53] <eric256> lol we need a mission statment

[20:53] <[particle]> how do you write infix:<+> in perl?

[20:53] <moritz_> http://irclog.perlgeek.de/parrot/2008-12-16#i_766322

[20:54] <eric256> ahh so in that case does it make more sense for everything to be written in pir ?

[20:54] <PerlJam> moritz_++

[20:54] <eric256> $a.succ for 1..$b :)

[20:54] <jnthn> eric256: Not everything.

[20:54] <moritz_> eric256: as always, it's neither black nor white

[20:54] <jnthn> I'd like _more_ of what we have to be written in Perl 6.

[20:54] <moritz_> eric256: there are things that work fantastically when written in perl6, but some primitives are better left in PIR

[21:07] <moritz_> is Grammar::Bar::foo valid if foo is defined in a superclass of Grammar::Bar?

[21:08] <jnthn> moritz_: I think so.

[21:08] <masak> moritz_: 'superclass' meaning 'grammar which Grammar::Bar derives from'?

[21:08] <masak> moritz_: I think so too.

[21:08] <moritz_> masak: aye

[21:09] <Tene> moritz_: I remember yes

[21:09] <masak> I have difficulty putting another meaning to the word.

[21:09] <moritz_> it just doesn't look like method call, that's why I doubted

[21:10] <masak> maybe if one or more of {token, regex, rule} work more like submethods than like methods. but I haven't read/heard of such a thing.

[21:10] <masak> moritz_: I think much of the point of deriving grammars is to have the non-overridden rules available.

[21:11] <pugs_svn> r24455 | putter++ | [STD.pm] Minor P5Regex bugfixes.  () and (?!) now parse.  (?!a) still doesn't.  Nor (?i:a), \y, etc.  1/4 of perl5's re_tests are unexpected parse failures.

[21:12] <moritz_> masak: sure, I just didn't know if they were available with that syntax

[21:12] <masak> moritz_: me neither. but it seems a reasonable extension of the way other code works.

[21:13] <masak> another way of saying the same thing is: "if the unqualified version of Grammar::Bar::foo works, why shouldn't the qualified version work too?"

[22:30] <masak> jnthn: I hope you do learn it. I expect it's more fun to go to .jp knowing how to read kana.

[22:30] <masak> I hope I learn it too, eventually.

[22:31] <jnthn> Oh, I want to before I go there.

[22:31] <jnthn> I know just how helpful such things can be. Trying to backpack accross Russia without knowing the Russian alphabet woulda been rather hard.

[22:31] <masak> aye.

[22:39] <pmichaud>    (enum B <> bug)    the correct compiler response is   "Don't do that, masak!"   :-P

[22:40] <pmichaud> I think I'm definitely going to hide a bug in Rakudo for masak++ to find that gives that sort of error message.  :-P

[22:44] <masak> yes, for all three impls, I'd say.

[22:45] <masak> I can't rule out the possibility that elf is Eastern enough.

[22:45] <masak> it's basically saying "you can't pick 2 here". that's deep, man.

[22:53] <masak> too bad that run.pugscode.org doesn't work anymore.

[22:54] <masak> I think a page like that can be really good for showing Perl 6 to people.

[22:54] <masak> maybe I should write a real REPL in Rakudo and put it online. :)

[22:55] <moritz_> masak: there's a patch for the 'P' part in RT

[22:55] <moritz_> (see p6l for the link)

[22:57] <masak> moritz_: I'm more interested in a patch for the 'long-term memory' part of a REPL.

[22:57] <masak> without that, much cool stuff is hard or impossible to do.

[22:58] <moritz_> masak: aye, I know

[23:34] <masak> so... the semantics of * in (1,2,3) ~~ (1,*,3) et al is "one or more", not "zero or more"?

[23:34] <masak> i.e. (1,2) ~~ (1,*,3) # doesn't match

[23:34] <jnthn> masak: zero or more, I believe.

[23:34] <moritz_> isn't it just "one arbitrary"?

[23:34] <jnthn> masak: Well, yeah.

[23:34] <masak> jnthn: yeah, what?

[23:34] <jnthn> masak: 1,2 won't match 1,3 either ;-)

[23:34] <moritz_> masak: 2 never matches 3

[23:34] <masak> jnthn: oops, bad example.

[23:34] <moritz_> rakudo: say (1, 2) ~~ (*);

[23:35] <moritz_> wtf?

[23:35] <jnthn> Hmm.

[23:35] <masak> jnthn: what do you think of that first one?

[23:35] <moritz_> why does it think I want to use a hyper operator?

[23:36] <jnthn> The first one looks like a bug.

[23:36] *** bloonix left
[23:36] <masak> jnthn: :)

[23:36] <jnthn> moritz_: Because it's implemented in terms of hyper

[23:36] <moritz_> rakudo: my @a = 1..10; say @a ~~ (*,2,*,5,*);

[23:36] * masak submits

[23:36] <p6eval> rakudo 34053: OUTPUT[1␤]

[23:36] <jnthn> (The spec actually says this.)

[23:36] <moritz_> jnthn: ah.

[23:36] <jnthn> moritz_: Aslo, dwimmery doesn't work unless you have Array, Array or List, List or a mix of the two

[23:37] <jnthn> The spec doesn't say dwim should work on ranges.

[23:37] <jnthn> (In fact, explicitly suggests it shouldn't.)

[23:37] <jnthn> The reason I think * can match 0 or more is the spec says you can use

[23:37] <moritz_> jnthn: that's why I used an array in the second case

[23:38] <jnthn> @a ~~ *,3,*

[23:38] <lambdabot> Maybe you meant: activity activity-full admin all-dicts arr ask . ? @ v

[23:38] <masak> jnthn: aye.

[23:38] <jnthn> And in that case it's a way of saying "is there a 3 in @a"

[23:38] <TimToady> except ~~ is tighter than ,

[23:38] <lambdabot> TimToady: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[23:38] <moritz_> crippled regex engine? ;-)

[23:38] <jnthn> I agree 1,2,3 ~~ 1,*,*,3 is odd, but should match.

[23:38] <jnthn> TimToady: Ah, yes.

[23:38] <masak> rakudo: say (3) ~~ (*,3,*)

[23:39] <p6eval> rakudo 34053: OUTPUT[Non-dwimmy hyperoperator cannot be used on arrays of different sizes or dimensions.␤current instr.: 'die' pc 14378 (src/builtins/control.pir:188)␤]

[23:39] <jnthn> TimToady: Rakudo gets the precednece right, you must do parens there.

[23:39] <jnthn> I'm just being tired and sloppy. :-)

[23:39] <masak> jnthn: is the above worth a ticket as well?

[23:39] <jnthn> masak: Erm. Only one ticket on the hyper issue.

[23:39] <jnthn> That one is interesting.

[23:40] <jnthn> Because it's thinking the LHS isn't a List or Array.

[23:40] <masak> jnthn: I haven't submitted a ticket on the hyper issue yet.

[23:40] <masak> moritz_: did you?

[23:40] <jnthn> rakudo: say list(3) ~~ (*,3,*)

[23:40] <p6eval> rakudo 34053: OUTPUT[1␤]

[23:40] <jnthn> Yes.

[23:41] <moritz_> masak: did I what?

[23:41] <jnthn> TimToady: Am I right in thinking a (3) doesn't construct a list here?

[23:41] <masak> moritz_: submit a ticket on the hyper issue.

[23:41] <moritz_> masak: no.

[23:41] * masak does, then

[23:41] <TimToady> it doesn't construct a list unless you say (3,)

[23:41] <jnthn> Right. So the dwim shouldn't work on the rhs of the smartmatch in this case

[23:42] <jnthn> (because Any and Array in the table say the dwim behaviour doesn't happen)

[23:42] <TimToady> unless the ACCEPTS on the right coerces the left to a list

[23:42] <jnthn> TimToady: The spec seemed to be to suggest we _do_ coerce it to a list.

[23:42] *** bloonix joined
[23:42] <moritz_> TimToady: what about * in left list, should that act as a wildcard?

[23:42] <jnthn> But we don't apply dwiminess after that.

[23:42] <TimToady> moritz_: no

[23:42] <moritz_> TimToady: ok.

[23:43] <TimToady> * ~~ 1 is false

[23:43] <moritz_> rakudo: say (1, *, 2) ~~ (1, *);

[23:43] <TimToady> ~~ is not a symmetrical operator

[23:43] <p6eval> rakudo 34053: OUTPUT[1␤]

[23:43] <masak> rakudo: say (3,) ~~ (*,3,*)

[23:43] <p6eval> rakudo 34053: OUTPUT[1␤]

[23:43] <jnthn> TimToady: So (3) ~~ (*,3,*) by my reading of the spec shoud not give 1.

[23:44] <masak> oh, so I just submitted a bug report with the wrong title. :)

[23:44] <jnthn> Of course, a 1-element array would.

[23:44] <jnthn> masak: We need to fix something, but I'm not completely sure what fix yet. :-)

[23:44] <masak> jnthn: right.

[23:44] <jnthn> TimToady: Where by 1 I mean true :-)

[23:44] <masak> now there's a ticket for it, at least.

[23:45] <jnthn> masak: Thanks.

[23:45] <eric256> rakudo: (1,2,3) ~~ (1,2,3)

[23:45] <p6eval> rakudo 34053: RESULT[Bool::True]

[23:45] <eric256> okay thats odd...localy it returns an error about accepts

[23:46] <moritz_> rakudo: say (1, 2, 3) ~~ [1, 2, 3]

[23:46] <TimToady> I'm still kinda low on blood sugar and caffeine at the moment, so I probably shouldn't make any profound decisions, but once the right side of ~~ is dispatched to ACCEPTS it depends on how it's implemented what it expects/allows on the left

[23:46] <p6eval> rakudo 34053: OUTPUT[1␤]

[23:46] <moritz_> eric256: svn up and rebuild

[23:46] <TimToady> and at that point I only care if it usually does what's expected in a bike-sheddy way

[23:47] <jnthn> TimToady: It does that much.

[23:47] <jnthn> The ACCEPTS of Array is deciding not to dwim in the case the LHS isn't an Array or List.

[23:47] <TimToady> so I don't have a strong opinion about (3) ~~ (*,3,*)

[23:47] <jnthn> Me either.

[23:47] <jnthn> I think what I have now is consistent with the spec as it stands now.

[23:47] <TimToady> but it would be easy to dwim it on Any too

[23:47] <jnthn> Yes, I agree.

[23:48] <TimToady> and it would also be easy to change the spec if it's wrong :)

[23:48] <jnthn> It'd be _less code_ for me to dwim it on Any too! :-)

[23:48] <TimToady> that's usually an indication...

[23:48] *** yjh joined
[23:48] <jnthn> OK. I'll change the spec and delete some code. :-)

[23:48] <masak> you guys make it really difficult to turn off the computer and go to sleep.
