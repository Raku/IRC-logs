[13:45] <masak> moritz_: we talked about named parameters being optional the other day. I just confirmed that they are on S06:763.

[13:45] *** Limbic_Region joined
[13:49] <masak> re S06:811, I don't understand what the difference would be between `sub head(*$head, *@tail)` and `sub head($head, *@tail)`...

[13:50] *** Limbic_Region left
[13:51] <masak> is it that the latter would not match a call on the form `head(1..Inf)`?

[13:52] *** `nipra left
[13:55] <masak> on S06:860, is the backslash intentional? in other words, does .perl on a Capture print something starting with a backslash?

[13:59] <masak> hm, seems it is. t/spec/S02-builtin_data_types/capture.t seems to use both '\' and '|'. nvm.

[14:00] *** aindilis` is now known as aindilis

[14:02] <masak> but wait! on S06:935, again a '\' is used in an argument list. now I'm confused.

[14:05] <masak> S06 just becomes stranger and stranger the further into it I get... :/

[14:11] *** mj41_ joined
[14:13] <moritz_> masak: *$head seems to make $head optional

[14:14] <masak> ah.

[14:14] <masak> so a slurpy scalar is the same as an optional argument?

[14:14] <[particle]1> that seems right to me

[14:14] *** [particle]1 is now known as [particle]

[14:14] *** preflex left
[14:15] <[particle]> i added parameter passing rules to nqp and rakudo some time ago

[14:15] <[particle]> lemme look at the nqp source to remember

[14:15] <masak> sure thing

[14:16] <moritz_> does nqp have slurpy params?

[14:16] <masak> this: `@a ==> @b` would be a pure list assignment, wouldn't it?

[14:16] <masak> could I write `@a ==> my @b`?

[14:16] <moritz_> I think you could

[14:17] <masak> and `@a ==> @b` is the same as `push @b, @a`, yes?

[14:17] <[particle]> http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/compilers/nqp/src/Grammar/Actions.pir ~423

[14:17] <moritz_> masak: you meant @a ==>> @b?

[14:17] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/4ox7d9

[14:17] <masak> moritz_: aye

[14:18] <[particle]> oh, also need parser link there...

[14:18] <moritz_> actions written in PIR look so painful ;)

[14:18] <[particle]> http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/compilers/nqp/src/Grammar.pm ~229

[14:19] <masak> I only have a Grammar.pg

[14:20] <[particle]> oh, sorry

[14:20] <[particle]> .pg

[14:20] <PerlJam> Wait ... when did ==> become two headed?  (==>>) 

[14:20] <[particle]> if $key eq 'slurp' {              # slurpy

[14:20] <[particle]>     $past.slurpy( $sigil eq '@' || $sigil eq '%' );

[14:20] <[particle]>     $past.named( $sigil eq '%' );

[14:20] <[particle]> }

[14:21] <masak> PerlJam: when it's additive, like >> in shells

[14:21] <[particle]> it's only slurpy if it's a @ or %

[14:21] <masak> [particle]: be that as it may, it's called 'slurpy scalar' in S06

[14:21] <[particle]> seems * is ignored for *$param

[14:21] <masak> [particle]: at least that's a semantics I can understand :)

[14:21] <PerlJam> masak: so, ==> is like "empty the target and fill it from the source" and ==>> is "add the source to the target"?

[14:22] <[particle]> http://spec.pugscode.org/ not responding :(

[14:22] <masak> PerlJam: think so

[14:22] <masak> [particle]: I had the same problem

[14:22] <masak> moritz_ did not

[14:22] <[particle]> dns cache?

[14:22] <masak> might be

[14:23] * [particle] restarts ff

[14:23] <moritz_> no, browser redirect cache

[14:23] <moritz_> with wget I get the same failure

[14:24] <PerlJam> btw, wrt slurpy scalars, I always though they were to circumvent laziness.  i.e., a slurpy scalar will eagerly get you one item from a listy source.

[14:24] <PerlJam> s/though/thought/

[14:24] <[particle]> sure, but are they optional?

[14:24] <[particle]> in nqp, they're not.

[14:25] <masak> quite.

[14:25] <PerlJam> I wouldn't expect them to be optional.

[14:26] <[particle]> then * is meaningless on scalar params

[14:26] <masak> S06 talks about them at length, so it doesn't seem they're meaningless

[14:26] <[particle]> that's the part i'm trying to look at next :)

[14:39] <masak> is there really a KitchenSink role in Perl 6? I don't know if that makes me laugh or cry

[14:39] <masak> couldn't it at least be called Sink?

[14:41] <moritz_> uhm, this is weird...

[14:41] <moritz_> the response header from feather's apache also includes

[14:41] <moritz_> Server: Microsoft-IIS/6.0

[14:41] <masak> haha

[14:41] <moritz_>   X-Powered-By: ASP.NET

[14:42] <masak> aye, S06 confirms the `@a ==> my $b` syntax.

[14:42] <masak> wonder if `@a ==>> my $b` would be equivalent or a syntax error?

[14:45] <moritz_> STD parse ==>> my @b

[14:47] <masak> are PRE blocks run after tie-breaking is finished on multisubs?

[14:49] <moritz_> yes

[14:49] <moritz_> if you want additional conditions that contribute to tie-breaking, you have to use subset types instead

[14:49] <masak> seems sane

[14:50] <PerlJam> I would think that @a ==>> my @b should just work fine.  (Since that's my "least surprise" and perl follows said principle)

[14:50] <masak> :)

[14:51] <masak> PerlJam: well, something like `my $b += 2` doesn't work

[14:51] <moritz_> pugs: my $b += 2;

[14:51] <p6eval> pugs: RESULT[\2]

[14:51] <masak> hm :)

[14:51] <moritz_> masak: sure? ;-)

[14:51] <masak> "test first, then speak with certainty"

[14:52] <masak> rakudo: my $b += 2;

[14:52] <p6eval> rakudo 31512: OUTPUT[MMD function __i_add not found for types (78, 92)␤current instr.: 'infix:+=' pc 11837 (src/gen_builtins.pir:7430)␤]

[14:52] <moritz_> rakudo can't autovivify scalars yet

[14:52] <moritz_> so my $x; $x++ will also fail

[14:53] <moritz_> rakudo: my Str $x; $x++; say $x

[14:53] <p6eval> rakudo 31512: OUTPUT[Str␤]

[14:53] <masak> I would at least not be surprised if the above threw a not-defined warning, something which Pugs does not support, IIRC

[14:53] <moritz_> aye

[14:53] <moritz_> otoh perl doesn't warn on $undef++ or $undef += $something either

[14:53] <moritz_> because it's such a common non-error case

[14:54] <masak> aye

[14:54] <masak> with that reasoning, Perl 6 shouldn't either

[14:54] <moritz_> rakudo: my $x = 0; my @a = <1 2>; $x += @a; say $x

[14:54] <p6eval> rakudo 31512: OUTPUT[2␤]

[14:55] <moritz_> I somehow thought that this doesn't work

[14:55] <moritz_> rakudo: my $x = 0; my @a = <a b  c d>; $x += @a; say $x

[14:55] <p6eval> rakudo 31513: OUTPUT[4␤]

[14:56] <moritz_> rakudo: my @x = 1, 2, 3; my $i = 0; $i += @x; say $i

[14:56] <p6eval> rakudo 31513: OUTPUT[3␤]

[16:17] <pmichaud> (my $b += 2;)    I suspect this will throw a warning

[16:18] <masak> ok.

[16:18] <pmichaud> however,   my $b;  $b++;    won't throw a warning, as we're explicitly allowed to increment undef values to Int

[16:18] <masak> what's the difference?

[16:19] <pmichaud> one's mentioned in the synopsis as being allowed while the other isn't?

[16:19] <moritz_> that does't look like a good reason to me ;)

[16:20] <masak> the feel very similar to me

[16:20] <masak> s/the/they/

[16:20] <moritz_> in perl 'my $b += 2' doesn't warn either

[16:21] <pmichaud> I'm just reading the synopsis.  :-)

[16:21] <pmichaud> I don't design the language, I just implement it.

[16:21] <pmichaud> The section that says that $x++ works on undef is in "Autoincrement precedence"

[16:21] <pmichaud> (in S03)

[16:22] *** mofino left
[16:22] <pmichaud> since += isn't "autoincrement", I'm not generalizing in that manner

[16:23] *** zamolxes left
[16:24] <pmichaud> otoh, the section "Declarators" does say:

[16:24] <pmichaud> When parentheses are omitted, you may use any infix assignment operator instead of = as the initializer. In that case, the left hand side of the infix operator will be the variable's prototype object:

[16:24] <pmichaud>     constant Dog $fido .= new;      # okay: a constant Dog object

[16:24] <pmichaud> so, "any infix assignment operator" would presumably include +=

[16:24] <pmichaud> that'll be weird.

[16:25] *** jhorwitz joined
[16:25] <meppl> good night

[16:26] <[particle]> Dog++

[16:26] <pmichaud> I'm not sure that STD.pm supports the other infix assignment ops as initializers yet, though.  It seems to only handle '=' and '.='

[16:26] *** meppl left
[16:26] <[particle]> what does that result in?

[16:26] <pmichaud> that would be an error, because Dog isn't in a suitable container

[16:27] <pasteling> "moritz_" at 89.13.207.187 pasted "failures while accessing http://dev.pugscode.org/changeset/22454" (9 lines, 2.2K) at http://sial.org/pbot/32382

[16:27] <[particle]> where Dog is the protoobject

[16:27] <pmichaud> right, it's not in a suitable container

[16:27] <pmichaud> it's like saying   3++

[16:27] <TimToady> I think += should be able to turn an Int into a 0

[16:27] <lambdabot> TimToady: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[16:27] <TimToady> or a Scalar into a 0

[16:28] <pmichaud> TimToady: okay, works for me.

[16:28] <[particle]> does that mean the Int protoobject has an Autoincrementable role?

[16:28] <[particle]> or Vivifiable?

[16:28] <pmichaud> I hadn't seen the line in S03 that said any infix assignment operator could be an initializer (until just now)

[16:29] <ruoso> I think "Uninitialized" is a special value that knows how to turn itself into a lot of values...

[16:30] <ruoso> like array, hash, 0, ""

[16:30] <TimToady> I don't know how generalizable the thing is

[16:30] <ruoso> because autovivification depends on it

[16:30] <pmichaud> TimToady: I'd agree with that, also.  :-)

[16:30] <TimToady> but maybe it's related to the table of degenerate reduction ops

[16:30] <moritz_> I think the ops should be special, not the undef

[16:30] <ruoso> postcircumfix:{} is not an op

[16:31] <TimToady> if [*]() is 1 then maybe *= autovivs to 1

[16:31] <ruoso> it's a method

[16:31] <moritz_> because it makes it easier to add types with new autovivification options

[16:31] <masak> just as the discussion gets interesting, I have to go :P

[16:31] <pmichaud> alas, so do I.

[16:31] <masak> see you around

[16:31] *** masak left
[16:32] <TimToady> I suspect the question is already answered. :)

[16:33] <ruoso> it is?

[16:33] <TimToady> I think there's a deep relationship between assignment ops and reduction ops

[16:36] * ruoso has a blurred mind at the moment...

[20:45] <moritz_> you are [particle] ;-)

[20:45] <[particle]> all i know is: it's not in the perl 6 spec, so it's not required for any perl 6 to implement.

[20:55] <Kitchy> Is it expected that the Camel book equivalent for Perl 6 will include community-written manpage stuff like the Perl 5 book does?
