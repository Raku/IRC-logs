[00:00] <ruoso> er... good question... bad habits die hard

[00:00] <masak> :)

[00:01] <ruoso> but is it ok to just do $foo.bar = $baz; ?

[00:01] <ruoso> or do I need to do $baz,

[00:01] <ruoso> since it's a list

[00:02] <masak> rakudo: my @a = (1,2,3); my $b = @a; say $b.perl

[00:02] <p6eval> rakudo 31963: OUTPUT[[1, 2, 3]␤]

[00:02] <masak> ruoso: should be ok.

[00:02] <ruoso> hmm... 

[00:03] <ruoso> rakudo: class Foo { has @.bar }; my $f = Foo.new(); $f.bar = 3;

[00:03] <p6eval> rakudo 31963: RESULT[[3]]

[00:04] <ruoso> rakudo: class Foo { has @.bar }; my $f = Foo.new(); $f.bar = (); say $f.bar

[00:04] <p6eval> rakudo 31963: OUTPUT[␤]

[00:04] <masak> rakudo: class Foo { has @.bar }; my $f = Foo.new(); $f.bar = (); say $f.bar.perl

[00:05] <pugs_svn> r22791 | ruoso++ | [smop-s1p] removing unnecessary parenthesis, as pointed by masak++

[00:06] <ruoso> but the semantics of that method is the thing that I'm still unsure

[00:06] <ruoso> does 'bless' means redefining isa and how?

[00:06] <ruoso> what happens if you re-bless an object?

[00:07] <masak> is the Perl 5 semantics applicable here?

[00:08] <ruoso> not really... 

[00:08] <masak> why not?

[00:08] <ruoso> because there's the possibility of methods being defined in that specific object

[00:08] <masak> ah, yes

[00:09] <masak> offhand, I'd say that bless redefines isa and how, yes

[00:09] <masak> seems saner.

[00:09] <ruoso> and removes all the methods and attributes defined in the current object?

[00:10] <masak> aye, I think so. don't want to leave stuff around needlessly.

[18:29] * azawawi is thinking of optimizing it using Inline::C

[18:30] <moritz_> does it really spend more time in DumpMatch than in STD.pm?

[18:30] <azawawi> yup

[18:30] <azawawi> please see the link i sent earlier

[18:30] *** pedrob joined
[18:31] <moritz_> I see it, but I don't believe it ;)

[18:31] <azawawi> it makes sense... try teststd

[18:33] *** ludan left
[18:34] <TimToady> is traverse_match trying to reconstruct the original order of tokens?

[18:34] <moritz_> I think so, yes

[18:34] <TimToady> well, I will say it again, the right way to do this is by annotating the _ array

[18:34] <azawawi> and it is recursive...

[18:36] <azawawi> well, what does that mean? ;-)

[18:37] <TimToady> it means I need to patch Cursor.pmc, I suppose...

[18:39] * azawawi hears voices whispering "Write it in C" ;-)

[18:39] * moritz_ know tries to parse STD.pm with itself and Devel::NYTProf

[18:41] <TimToady> you will get very different results depending on whether the lexer cache exists already

[18:42] <TimToady> if it doesn't exists, you'll spend a lot of time in canmatch()

[18:43] <moritz_> so I have to run it twice ;)

[18:44] <TimToady> anyway, I assure you it works  :)

[18:45] <moritz_> what, profiling?

[18:45] <TimToady> NYTProf

[18:45] <TimToady> on STD

[18:45] <moritz_> well, I get some warnings on report generation

[18:45] <TimToady> on STD parsing STD, specifically

[18:46] <TimToady> you may want the option that doesn't combine anonynous things

[18:46] <moritz_> I suspect it's because I'm not using the first perl in $PATH

[18:46] <moritz_> "No file line range data for sub 'Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Role::meta'

[18:46] <moritz_> "

[18:46] <moritz_> stuff like that

[18:46] <TimToady> those are all evals

[18:46] *** yantom left
[18:46] <TimToady> so it's kinda natural there's no file...

[18:46] <moritz_> ok

[18:47] <TimToady> the other problem is some degree of confusion between pm and pmc, esp when they're different languages

[18:48] <moritz_> did you tell tim about it?

[18:48] <moritz_> I guess it's something you can easily forget ;)

[18:48] <azawawi> moritz_: can plz cpan Devel::NYTProf on feather1?

[18:48] <TimToady> yes, but there's not really a way to fix it when p5 lies to itself about whether it's using .pmc or .pm

[18:49] <TimToady> you can make a symlink for Cursor.pm to Cursor.pmc

[18:49] <TimToady> but you can't do that for STD.pm to STD.pmc without clobbering STD.pm

[18:49] <ruoso> I think that's the point where using an old hack meant to something else comes back to haunt you...

[18:51] <TimToady> anyway, if you want to temporarily make STD.pm a symlink to STD.pmc, you can just save STD.pm off to the side, or plan to restore from svn

[18:51] <TimToady> but I found I'm usually more interested in what Cursor.pmc is doing

[18:52] <moritz_> azawawi: I built the .deb package for Devel::NYTProf, but since there's another apt/dpkg job running I can't install it atm

[18:52] *** Lorn_ joined
[18:53] <TimToady> most of the work in STD is very distributed, so low-hanging fruit is in Cursor.pmc, or in telling gimme5 how not to call Cursor.pmc unnecessarily

[21:25] <moritz_> azawawi: I care too much about privacy to use it right now. When it's packaged by a third party, works (natively) on linux, and free of privacy issues... I might give it a try

[21:25] <mncharity> let me know if it doesn't run ;)

[21:25] <mncharity> never actually got to the display IR analysis part.  only parse and IR trees.

[21:25] * azawawi is imagining how DumpMatch.traverse_match will look in Inline::C ;-)

[21:26] *** ispy_ joined
[21:28] * mncharity notes tcc (tiny cc) has finally addressed it's "we're still running on cvs, thus hurting community" issue.  So Inline::C which doesn't touch disk becomes more interesting.

[21:29] <mncharity> http://search.cpan.org/~hamano/C-TCC-0.03/lib/C/TCC.pm

[21:29] <lambdabot> Title: C::TCC - An interface to the TCC(Tiny C Compiler) - search.cpan.org

[21:30] <azawawi> mncharity: tcc.. interesting

[21:31] <mncharity> as long as you preload any headers, you can compile and link C without touching disk.

[21:31] <mncharity> poorman's jit

[21:31] <mncharity> x86 only. :/

[21:32] <azawawi> ... which is everywhere these days

[21:32] <mncharity> I thought there was an Inline::TCC or an Inline::C::TCC, but I'm not seeing it.  hmm.

[21:33] <azawawi> im seeing a comment in use.perl about it: http://use.perl.org/~jdavidb/journal/21543

[21:33] <lambdabot> Title: Journal of jdavidb (1361)

[21:34] <mncharity> hmm, looks like arm's been added.

[21:34] <mncharity> re comment, yes.   curious.  crossed it off my todo list with a "someone else got to it first".  :)  now... puzzled.

[21:38] <mncharity> sigh.  suggestion for a channel operator:

[22:01] <TimToady> @tell azawawi I believe the "reds" program I just checked in prints out all the reductions you're interested in; sorting by initial/final positions gives you the span of each reduction, including all the ones that are thrown away in the final tree

[22:01] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
