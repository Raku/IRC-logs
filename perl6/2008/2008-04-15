[02:37] <Morasique> does anybody know how to call a parent method from within a child class? i'm told it's .SUPER.method(), but it doesn't seem to be working

[02:42] <mncharity> ﻿Morasique: which perl6 implementation?

[02:46] <mncharity> i don't see many tests for SUPER, and none of that flavor, in t/oo/*.t, which strongly suggests it's not implemented.

[02:46] <Morasique> ok, thanks

[02:49] <mncharity> ﻿Morasique: if you don't mind me asking, what are you working on?  there's another implementation, elf, currently also without SUPER, but to which it would be much more easily added.

[02:51] <Morasique> i'm in an undergraduate group working on a small project, we had to choose a language we didn't already know so we're going with perl 6. we can work around it, it's not a major problem, i just figured it was implemented and i was making a mistake somewhere

[02:52] *** [particle] joined
[02:54] <mncharity> ah.  ok.  note that pugs has a lot of rough edges.  a common experience is spending a lot of time struggling to work around pugs implementation bugs.  and for larger projects, struggling unsuccessfully.

[02:55] <mncharity> depending on the project, I'd be hesitant to use it myself.

[02:59] <Morasique> yeah, i imagine this would be pretty bad if we were doing a larger project, but we should be ok for this. thanks

[03:40] <pugs_svnbot> r20291 | putter++ | [STD_red] same.

[03:40] <pugs_svnbot> diff: http://dev.pugscode.org/changeset/20291

[03:40] <lambdabot> Title: Changeset 20291 - Pugs - Trac

[03:42] *** alester left
[03:45] <mncharity> development path big picture is (1) eat yet_another_regex_engine (node analysis, core, emitters, test suite), and get it working; then (2) contemplate STD.pm hungrily.

[03:46] <Auzon> Does #2 imply a full Perl 6 implementation?

[03:48] <Auzon> well, the completion. Contemplating is different from running it :P

[03:48] *** meppl left
[03:50] <mncharity> re full, no.  a very great deal of work remains to create a full Perl 6 implementation.  but a p6-based version of STD would allow discarding STD_red, and by providing a p6 front end, thus hypothetically make elf a full bootstrap.

[03:51] <mncharity> instead of elf just being a backend bootstrap.

[03:52] <mncharity> lot of swamp between here and there.

[03:52] <Auzon> I didn't know that elf used Ruby...

[03:53] <mncharity> elf uses STD_red to parse code and produce a Match tree.

[03:55] <Auzon> You make this all sound deceptively easy ;)

[03:55] <mncharity> :)

[03:58] <Auzon> Well, good luck to you. I hope to play with this stuff once summer begins for me.

[04:00] *** agentzh left
[04:01] <mncharity> once you have something which can parse p6, taking that parse tree, and for some small but usable dialect, emitting usably fast code, isn't really enormously difficult.  it's that first step which we've historically been stuck on.  once one has a usable p6-like implementation, then there's the really big third step, which is

[04:01] <mncharity> fleshing it out into a real Perl 6.

[04:01] <Auzon> So are you still within parameters for the first step?

[04:03] <mncharity> then again, part of that being easy is that other hard pieces have already been done.  It would be really depressing if one now needed to write a regex engine from scratch, rather than being able to assimilate a more-or-less working one.

[04:05] <mncharity> STD_red remains a work in progress.  Basically when elf needs it to be doing better, it gets further attention.  It's two biggest current annoyances are needing ";" after "}" which shouldn't need them ("sub f {};"), and broken prefix/postfix operator handling ("$x++").

[04:06] <mncharity> It's also fallen rather out of sync with STD.pm.

[04:06] *** CodeBlock left
[04:07] <mncharity> Hmm.  Maybe should do a "}" handling kludge, just so more of the test suite can be run.

[04:07] <Auzon> Is it a fast kludge? :P

[04:07] *** yewenbin left
[04:09] <mncharity> hypothetically, but yes.  STD_red payed "manual maintenance and update burden (big, ugly burden)" for "runs fast" and "low development risk".

[04:10] <Auzon> Well, a lack of a semicolon after } is very frequent. But kludges can get ugly.

[04:14] <mncharity> re '﻿kludges can get ugly', this would just be a simple attempt at lowhanging fruit.  eg, /} *\n/ is considered }; .  shouldn't break anything in elf, and any tests it helps with are all gravy.

[04:14] *** meppl joined
[04:15] <mncharity> end of day.

[04:15] <Auzon> Would this be in STD_red or elf itself?

[04:15] <mncharity> STD_red

[04:15] <Auzon> ok. Well, good night, if you're leaving.

[04:16] <mncharity> well, if you had other questions, I'll stay for a bit.  but yes, it's late.

[04:16] <Auzon> No, it's OK. I'm done being curious for tonight :)

[04:17] <mncharity> useful to have questions.  i'd forgotten about the }; hack idea.

[04:17] <mncharity> :)

[04:17] <Auzon> Glad I could remind you, then :)

[04:17] <mncharity> indeed.  thanks.

[17:55] <cognominal_> what is the @INC equivalent in Perl 6?

[17:56] <moritz_> perhaps @*INC?

[17:56] <moritz_> pugs: @*ING

[17:56] <exp_evalbot> RESULT[[]]

[17:56] <moritz_> pugs: @*INC

[17:56] <exp_evalbot> RESULT[\undef]

[17:57] <moritz_> that's only because evalbot's pugs runs in safe mode

[17:57] <moritz_> pugs -e 'say @*INC.perl' # gives you a nice list

[17:58] <TimToady> @*INC, if it continues to exist, will likely indicate only the user's private directories

[17:58] <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list

[17:59] <TimToady> pulling things out of the official library will require an official api

[17:59] <TimToady> because it more resembles a database query, not a probe of a directory
