[06:28] <spinclad> it knows how to parse, but knows not that it knows

[06:29] <Auzon> What was it supposed to do?

[06:29] <TimToady> turn into an AI

[06:30] <spinclad> what, no omphaloskepsis?

[06:30] <spinclad> no self-knowledge?

[06:31] <TimToady> most OO languages are confused about "self"

[06:31] <spinclad> 'yes, that's _your_ self, not _my_ self.'

[06:34] *** justatheory left
[06:37] <spinclad> Auzon: one could dream of it returning a parse-tree with <statementlist> in it.  other than that, it did what it ought.

[06:38] <Auzon> That's what I suspected

[06:39] <Auzon> I'm a fan of code that you can ask "hey, what do are you trying to do with this input?"

[06:39] <spinclad> 'hey, give it back.  it's mine!'

[06:40] <spinclad> 'thief!  programses!  we hates them, yes we do!'

[06:41] <TimToady> hey, I said it parsed it, not that it returned anything useful :)

[06:41] <Auzon> The implications of programs acting like golem (it is golem who acts like that, right?) simply scares me.

[06:43] <spinclad> it was baggins who acted like that.  give us back our preciouss!

[06:43] <Auzon> Yeah...

[06:43] <Auzon> Then where did I get "golem" from?

[06:44] <spinclad> gollum  (aka Sméagol)

[06:44] <Auzon> Aha

[06:44] <TimToady> a golem is one of those undead things that wanders around cemeteries...

[06:45] <Auzon> I thought he was the one that had the "my precioussss" lines

[06:45] <TimToady> usually in Prague

[06:45] <spinclad> (the golem was man creating a man in his own image)

[06:49] <spinclad> i heard from Gerry Sussman that he, Marvin Minsky, and Joel Moses, all at MIT AI Lab/Lab for Comp Sci, were all descended from the Maharal of Prague, maker of the golem in question

[06:50] * jql wonders if men made from mud is metaphorically significant in #perl6

[06:50] <spinclad> Joel felt it had deep meaning, Marvin thought it void of significance

[06:52] <Auzon> It's kind of interesting that you mention the AI Lab, since that's trying to create intelligence in our own image.

[06:53] <spinclad> ISTR that Gerry dedicated his thesis to the Maharal, "who first noted that 'and God created man in his own image' was recursive"

[06:54] <Auzon> What is 'ISTR'?

[06:54] <TimToady> I seem to recall

[06:54] <spinclad> I Seem To Recall

[06:54] <Auzon> I see. I haven't heard that one before

[06:55] <TimToady> the question is, to *whom* do you seem to have recalled it...

[06:55] <spinclad> yes, it's an interesting connection.  one of the things Joel found profound.

[06:56] <spinclad> .oO { i have recalled it to my mind, and called it to yours }

[06:56] <TimToady> but surely you call something before you recall it...

[06:58] <spinclad> i heard the call, i hear it still in the stillness...

[06:58] <spinclad> i must recollect it before i can recall it to you

[06:59] <TimToady> you'll have to remind yourself a few times first

[06:59] <TimToady> me, I mind my wife, and then she reminds me...

[07:00] <spinclad> sir!  this time you go too far!  _mind_ and i have agreed to never speak again.

[07:01] <TimToady> well, for my part, it's about time for Mind over Mattress...

[07:01] <Auzon> Good night then :)

[07:02] <TimToady> g'night & zzz

[07:03] <spinclad> pardon, i'm getting too silly here.  i shall take your diagnosis and medicine for my own.

[07:03] <Auzon> I found it amusing, for what it's worth
