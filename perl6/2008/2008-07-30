[00:34] <Auzon> Do they point to other sites? That's one probable cause.

[00:36] <davidm123> well, they are on a different domain

[17:15] <[particle]> yes, however *i* didn't spam the channel when asking :)

[17:15] <Auzon> :P

[17:16] <Auzon> I didn't think it'd go well, since most code directed to perl6: parses

[17:16] <moritz_> [particle]: hehe ;)

[17:16] <moritz_> what we could do is to summarize identical output

[17:17] <[particle]> has anybody run make test in pugs recently?

[17:17] <[particle]> i wonder how it fares with the spectests

[17:17] <moritz_> so the above you just be `elf 21634, pugs , rakudo 29834: OUTPUT[dunno␤]'

[17:17] <[particle]> it'd be nice to compare rakudo to pugs that way

[17:18] <[particle]> interesting that pugs doesn't have a revision

[17:18] <masak> [particle]: trying...

[17:18] <masak> no, I can't build Pugs

[17:19] <masak> I've got it through Cabal

[17:19] <moritz_> same here

[17:19] <moritz_> maybe we could run test without 'make'?

[17:19] <[particle]> prove t/spec

[17:19] <masak> good idea

[17:19] <[particle]> or prove6

[17:20] <moritz_> [particle]: pugs can't parse new-style POD

[17:20] <[particle]> nice.

[17:20] <[particle]> so, rakudo is passing more spectests then pugs :)

[17:21] <moritz_> let's see, there are still some files wihtout POD

[17:22] <masak> moritz_: maybe one could fudge away the new-style POD in pugs?

[17:22] <moritz_> masak: I think most of the POD can simply be removed, and substituted with plain old comments

[17:22] <masak> good.

[17:23] <[particle]> what's wrong with pod? it's so easy to parse

[17:23] <moritz_> [particle]: yes. But it has to be done ;)

[17:23] <moritz_> [particle]: feel free to patch pugs' parser... oh, wait... ;)

[17:24] <pmurias> moritz_: what does he have to wait for?

[17:24] <lambdabot> pmurias: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.

[17:24] <[particle]> iirc you can build pugs with a sufficiently old rev, and ghc 6.6.x

[17:24] <moritz_> pmurias: haskell fu?

[17:24] <[particle]> it seems silly to me to take pod out of the official test suite because of a broken implementation

[17:25] <moritz_> yes

[17:25] <moritz_> but is there a good reason to keep it?

[17:26] <moritz_> I mean the coresponding synopsis is stalled and not being discussed, and in such a state rather worthless

[17:26] <[particle]> um, as documentation?

[17:26] <moritz_> and what does it offer us over plain comments, in the form it is currently used?

[17:26] <[particle]> damn, i should have asked damian about the pod spec last week

[17:27] <moritz_> aye

[17:27] <moritz_> Files=277, Tests=5012, 420 wallclock secs ( 7.00 usr  2.20 sys + 386.05 cusr  9.94 csys = 405.19 CPU)

[17:27] <moritz_> Result: FAIL

[17:27] <moritz_> Failed 182/277 test programs. 531/5012 subtests failed.

[17:27] <moritz_> seems like pugs still wins ;)

[17:28] <[particle]> ok, then. time to add more pod :)

[17:28] <pmurias> the ghc in lenny compiles pugs?

[17:28] <moritz_> pmurias: yes, if you use the cabal route

[17:29] <moritz_> a simple "make" doesn't work

[17:29] <[particle]> iiuc, the problems with pod6 are entirely outside the bounds of its current usage

[17:29] <[particle]> i wonder...

[17:30] <moritz_> [particle]: not entirely

[17:30] <pmurias> moritz_: the README is wrong than?

[17:30] <moritz_> [particle]: if we acknowledge that we need to have stuff that is both POD and program, such as sub declarations, POD syntax might change

[17:30] <[particle]> does the 'sublanguages' concept as applied to regexes, quoting, et cetera in the perl 6 grammar allow the tools necessary to alleviate the concerns regarding pod

[17:31] <moritz_> pmurias: the README just says "see INSTALL"

[17:31] <moritz_> pmurias: and the INSTALL describes several methods, one of which actually works

[17:32] <moritz_> [particle]: the point has always been that you shouldn't need the Perl 6 grammar to parse POD

[17:32] *** bbkr joined
[17:32] <pmurias> moritz_: the methods that don't work should be documented as such

[17:53] <moritz_> Auzon: very good

[17:56] <[particle]> hrmm, i may have to get all MakeMaker on src/perl6/ :/

[17:57] <pmurias> [particle]: can't you just grab a make?

[17:59] <[particle]> i'm on windows

[17:59] <[particle]> './gimme5' doesn't work

[17:59] <Auzon> Some part of it doesn't work on Mac, either, from what I hear

[17:59] <[particle]> if i convert to 'perl gimme5' then will it respect the #! in gimme5?

[18:01] <moritz_> [particle]: only the arguments (like -w, if any)

[18:01] <[particle]> figured as much. i suppose that's ok, since there's 'use 5.010' in the files

[18:02] <moritz_> [particle]: if you want to change Makefile (and commit the changes), rather make it 'perl5.10.0 gimme5'

[18:07] <pugs_svn> r21635 | moritz++ | [evalbot] group identical results in output of 'perl6:'

[18:09] <moritz_> Auzon: did you modify evalbot locally?

[18:10] <Auzon> Yes, but the changes are in SVN as well

[18:10] <moritz_> because I got a conflict on updating

[18:10] <moritz_> on timtowtdi.org

[18:10] <Auzon> Sorry about that :-/

[18:10] <moritz_> I simply reverted it

[18:11] <moritz_> Auzon: no problem, I just wanted to know if it had changes worth preserving

[18:11] *** p6eval left
[18:11] <Auzon> Nope. I just wanted to edit it there, then realized it was easier to commit on my computer, and I didn't get the exact same changes

[18:11] *** p6eval joined
[18:11] <moritz_> rakudo: say "basic sanity"

[18:12] <p6eval> rakudo 29834: OUTPUT[basic sanity␤]

[18:12] <[particle]> moritz_: there is no perl5.10.0 on windows. there is only 'perl'

[18:12] <moritz_> perl6: say "basic sanity"

[18:12] <p6eval> elf 21635, pugs, rakudo 29834: OUTPUT[basic sanity␤]

[18:12] <moritz_> [particle]: I didn't know that. How inconvenient

[18:12] <[particle]> oh, oops, i do have 5.10.0 (i typed it wrong)

[18:12] <moritz_> YaY, less line noise from p6eval 

[18:13] <moritz_> perl6: print 2.perl

[18:13] <p6eval> elf 21635, pugs: OUTPUT[2]rakudo 29834: RESULT[21]

[18:13] <moritz_> oops, missing a newline

[18:15] <pugs_svn> r21636 | moritz++ | [evalbot separate different outputs from 'perl6:' with newlines

[18:15] *** p6eval left
[18:15] <[particle]> what's the diff between OUTPUT[] and RESULT[] ?

[18:15] *** p6eval joined
[18:15] <moritz_> [particle]: RESULT is when something didn't produce output

[18:16] <moritz_> perl6: print 2.perl

[18:16] <p6eval> elf 21636, pugs, rakudo 29834: OUTPUT[2]

[18:16] <[particle]> odd

[18:16] <moritz_> I got a segfault from parrot during the first eval

[18:16] <moritz_> pugs: print 2.perl

[18:16] <[particle]> perl6: $_ = 'foo'; .say;

[18:44] <viklund`> uhm, bug in rakudo I think:

[18:45] <viklund`> rakudo: my $p='monkey'; say substr($p,0,0)

[18:45] <p6eval> rakudo 29834: OUTPUT[monkey␤]

[18:47] <masak> ah, that's probably because the second 0 is treated as nonexistent

[18:47] <moritz_> which is wrong, of course

[18:47] <moritz_> is there a test for that?

[18:47] <masak> aye

[18:48] <masak> ...it's wrong, I mean

[18:48] <masak> don't know about the test

[18:49] <moritz_> doesn't seem like

[18:49] <moritz_> I'll add one

[18:49] <moritz_> pugs: my $p='monkey'; say substr($p,0,0)

[18:49] <p6eval> pugs: OUTPUT[␤]

[18:50] <viklund`> this works

[18:50] <masak> ah, it treats -1 as last char minus 1

[18:50] <viklund`> rakudo: my $p='monkey'; say substr($p,0,-$p.chars)

[18:50] <p6eval> rakudo 29834: OUTPUT[␤]

[18:50] <masak> and 0 as last char

[18:50] <pugs_svn> r21637 | moritz++ | [spec] added substr test with 0 as third arg, masak++

[18:51] <moritz_> but the last arg should be length, not position, right?

[18:51] *** chris2 joined
[18:51] <masak> moritz_: that too

[18:51] <masak> moritz_: unless negative
