[00:43] <garo> I went to the talk at fosdem about perl6 a couple of hours ago and i just have to say 2 words: WOW, THANKS !!!

[00:46] <Juerd> What impresses you most?

[00:46] <Juerd> There's so much neat stuff.

[00:47] <garo> the amount of new stuff impressed me the most, it makes perl almost another language

[00:50] <TimToady> You're welcome!

[00:50] <garo> Aren't you afraid that most people will miss a big a part of all the new features ? You guys experience all the changes gradually, but most users will make the step to perl 6 in very short amount of time.

[00:51] <TimToady> the idea is for people to discover them as they go along when they need them

[00:51] <TimToady> much like people don't discover closures in Perl 5 until they need them

[00:52] <TimToady> if the initial experience is pretty much the same, people will not have too much future shock

[00:52] <Juerd> garo: Well, that will go as with every new language that you learn.

[00:53] <Juerd> garo: In many ways, Perl 6 really is a new language. It certianly looks like Perl though :)

[00:53] <TimToady> in other words, we make it easy to write more-or-less correct cargo cult code, which usually works even if the user doesn't really know everything that's going on underneath

[00:54] <TimToady> in that sense it is still very like Perl 5

[00:54] <garo> I'm a bit afraid that it's going to be like my first experience with regexps. I programmed in C, never heard of the concept of regexps, so never missed it. But now that i know it, i couldn't live without it 

[00:55] <TimToady> on the other end, we're trying very hard to make Perl 6 a language that doesn't run out of gas just when you need it to go another mile down the road

[00:56] <TimToady> basically, we've set ourselves almost impossible design goals, and are coming very close to implementing them. :)

[00:56] <garo> :)

[00:57] <TimToady> and we've always felt (well, since 2000) that Perl culture was strong enough to take the shock.

[00:58] *** Botje joined
[00:58] <TimToady> but that's partly because we've stretched it all out like a bungee cord.

[01:00] <TimToady> everyone can take as much time as they like to get used to it, because we're not shutting down Perl 5

[01:00] <Juerd> garo: I alreday have a hard time living without Perl 6, and I haven't even used it much yet!

[01:01] <Juerd> (What's with my fingers swapping letters?)

[01:01] <TimToady> whoops, gotta drive to San Francisco now...

[01:01] <Juerd> TimToady: Drive safely!

[01:01] <Juerd> TimToady: Et bon voyage

[01:01] <TimToady> my kid left his wallet at the con :(

[13:29] <mncharity> What would be a good one-line summary of the focus of current rakudo development?

[13:33] <pmichaud> functionality.

[13:34] <pmichaud> personally, I'm focused on getting the basic features of Perl (6) to work

[13:37] <ruoso> pmichaud, that being?

[13:38] *** alester joined
[13:38] <pmichaud> lists, hashes, subroutines -- the basic things that one would need for writing a Perl program

[13:40] <ruoso> hmmm... I see...

[13:40] <ruoso> it's just that the "basic things" may be very diverse ;)

[13:40] <ruoso> depending on the eye

[13:40] <pmichaud> correct

[13:41] <pmichaud> Most Perl (5 or 6) programmers would expect hashes and lists to be available when writing a Perl program, so I think of those as being basic

[13:42] <pmichaud> multimethod dispatch is somewhat unique to Perl 6, so it's not "basic"

[13:42] <pmichaud> regexes are basic, named rules and grammars aren't basic

[13:42] <pmichaud> etc.

[13:42] <ruoso> otoh, depending on the area of work, the basic might be perl 6 oo features...

[13:42] <ruoso> I don't mean to say you're wrong at all

[13:42] <pmichaud> i.e., my focus is to get enough of rakudo working that Perl (5) programmers can start playing with it and have most of the things they're used to working

[13:43] <ruoso> ah... that's a pretty more defined focus ;)

[13:43] <pmichaud> yes, oo can also be considered "basic" from a "what do I need next to build Perl 6" perspective

[13:44] <pmichaud> thus rakudo has enough oo to get started

[16:22] <mncharity> hmm, really need something between big-picture README and 'insufficient discussion of objectives and approach' low-level STATUS tasks.  ah, well.  todo.

[16:24] <mncharity> Perl 6 development has a cultural tradition of avoiding conflict.  "At least he's doing something.  I won't criticize or question, because that might chase him away, and after all, he may in future do something I *don't* think is completely misguided".  We've had years of that.

[23:40] <mncharity> cmarcelo: re dev.pugscode.org/wiki , yeah, and http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi .  but after using mediawiki a lot, the lack of a Talk page associated with each content page, really hits as a major loss.  It's like asking someone for comments on a paper, but requiring them to wordsmith their comments, and blend them into the article people are reading.

[23:40] <lambdabot> Title: Perl 6 / Perl 6

[23:41] <mncharity> rather than scribbling in the margins, sending you an email, or telling you verbally.  a *much* higher barrier to entry.  and a practically absolute barrier to several useful forms of collaboration on the document.

[23:44] <mncharity> eg, I went to add something to the pf.org wiki, but was unsure of why the author was doing something in what seemed a suboptimal way.  instead of being able to leave a note in Talk describing the intent/question/issue, the only choices were smash the author's existing content while not understanding it, or greatly uglyify the document by inlining commentary and questions.

[23:46] <mncharity> one could certainly have Talk pages on a trac wiki.  But the absence of a tiny bit of "make it easy to see if a Talk doc exists, and to link to it without hand maintaining a link", and of the social convention, makes it not happen.

[23:47] <meppl> good night

[23:47] <FurnaceBoy> Trac tickets won't cut it?

[23:53] <mncharity> FurnaceBoy: I started to say "kidding, yes?", but there are indeed similarities.  but it's sort of like comparing those comment hacks at the bottom of blogs, with using Talk on wikipedia.  kind of similar, but the differences make for a different style of use.  trac ticket comment chains are like using email.  "regards your third point, mumble, well, frotz".

[23:54] <FurnaceBoy> or bugzilla issues.

[23:54] <FurnaceBoy> not perfect, granted.

[23:54] <FurnaceBoy> but i never used mediawiki talk ... prefer TWiki, myself.

[23:54] <FurnaceBoy> we use Trac + Jabber

[23:54] <cmarcelo> mncharity: I see, I like the Talk pages idea too. easy solution would be adding them as needed (you add a Talk link for the page and put the talk there). people will learn the convention after you use it sometimes..

[23:55] <cmarcelo> or, you could contact pf.org/perl6 people to migrate to a different wiki... ;-)

[23:56] <mncharity> cmarcelo: yeah, the technical side is basically a one line hack.  "every page Foo gets a link to FooTalk on top".

[23:56] <FurnaceBoy> cmarcelo: neat idea
