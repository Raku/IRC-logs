[19:59] *** chris2 left
[19:59] <pmurias> ruoso: do you think it makes sense to add a backend to kp6 which emits code using the mp6 runtime? (just started porting mp6's emitter)

[20:00] <ruoso> I'm not sure...

[20:00] <ruoso> will it be more usefull than mp6 itself?

[20:01] <ruoso> maybe it's nice to bootstrap kp6-mp6

[20:01] <ruoso> and get rid on mp6-grammar dependency

[20:03] <pmurias> kp6 is easier to hack on then mp6

[20:04] <pmurias> and it would likely ease the bootstrap on an other backend

[23:32] <rakudo_svn> r26130 | jonathan++ | [rakudo] Start to implement pairs. Add grammar rules and partly implement actions. Tweak Pair PMC so it's usable in Perl 6. Still lots to do, and this doesn't work with calls yet, so don't expect to do anything especially useful with it right now. :-)

[23:38] <spinclad> cj: TimToady's probably not the one to ask -- fglock is i would say head architect of kp6, and the general rule would be 'have at it' if you have specific changes in mind.
