[09:01] <gaal> Hi, folks. Has anyone been trying to build Pugs itself recently with a HEAD GHC?

[09:03] <avar> Probably not, pugs is pretty much abandonware now ;/

[09:03] <avar> need more lambdacamels

[09:05] <gaal> I'm trying to treat bitrot. The compilation is failing very early with bad package paths etc., and I don't really remember how our wrapped ghc-pkg was supposed to work

[09:06] <gaal> Does it build OK with a release GHC? What version?

[09:17] <avar> I haven't built it in over a year

[09:22] <gaal> One problem is that we use ghc-pkg-wrapper in configuration, but that uses the third-party/installed/packages.conf, which is initially empty

[09:23] <gaal> So base GHC packages aren't seen, and configuration fails.

[09:24] <gaal> Now, I don't remember if there was some way to say "use this packags.conf to read, and that packages.conf to write/install to"

[09:30] <gaal> Okay, I have a one-character patch to do that

[09:30] *** penk joined

[10:00] <luqui> gaal, yeah, it's going to suck kindof.  there was a big library package shift for 6.8.  some of the breakage falls back on the package authors...

[10:09] <gaal> luqui: (hi!) I don't understand how what we have now _could_ have worked

[17:42] <pugs_svn> r19327 | ruoso++ | [yap6] The autovivification schema requires a full bootstrapped object system after all. So I decided to work a little more in the YAP6 bootstrap concept, take a look at NOTES_BOOTSTRAP.txt to understand how YAP6 will bootstrap itself and support any object system.

[17:43] <ruoso> @tell fglock please take a look at http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/v6/yap6/NOTES_BOOTSTRAP.txt

[17:43] <lambdabot> Consider it noted.

[17:44] <ruoso> I really would like considerations on the NOTES_BOOTSTRAP.txt file I've just written. This may be the last architectural sketch of YAP6 before having it completely planned.

[19:38] <wolverian> it seems to be relatively hard to add showing line numbers on the page on hover into smartlinks.pl ... easiest way to me looks parsing the html as an extra pass to gather the line numbers from the html that way 

[19:39] * wolverian investigates more

[19:44] <pugs_svn> r19328 | ruoso++ | [yap6] Entering a very extensive deep refactoring. After studying more

[19:44] <pugs_svn> r19328 | ruoso++ | the specs and ellaborating NOTES_BOOTSTRAP.txt, the mechanism was very

[19:44] <pugs_svn> r19328 | ruoso++ | simplified and we have now a implementation independent API that the

[19:44] <pugs_svn> r19328 | ruoso++ | implementations will bind to. The first implementation will be the

[19:44] <pugs_svn> r19328 | ruoso++ | YAP6__LOWL__... objects which will comply to the new API. The

[19:44] <pugs_svn> r19328 | ruoso++ | structure didn't change much, but now I understood that I should start

[19:44] <pugs_svn> r19328 | ruoso++ | by the metaclass object even for the lowlevel objects that will be

[19:44] <pugs_svn> r19328 | ruoso++ | implemented in C. After that, the higher level objects will be

[19:45] <pugs_svn> r19328 | ruoso++ | implemented in a stage1 language that knows how to use this lowlevel

[19:45] <pugs_svn> r19328 | ruoso++ | objects.

[19:47] <pbuetow> wow!

[19:48] <ruoso> pmurias, please take a look at the new NOTES_BOOTSTRAP.txt and the new yap6.h

[19:48] <mncharity> my first experience using socialtext.  first impression: it's very much weaker than mediawiki.  eg,

[19:48] <ruoso> I'm in despair for reviews

[19:50] <mncharity> eg, I changed a line or two of someone else's text.  there was no way to comment on intent (no change log message, no associated talk/discussion page).  the mediawiki social context and conventions were missing.  it felt like using a usemod.

[19:52] <mncharity> do we *really* want to use this instead of http://perl.net.au/ ?

[19:52] <TimToady> ruoso: the thing I get from it is that the protoobject is basically caching the responder interface that is computed by the metaclass 

[19:53] <ruoso> TimToady, not only caching, but holding the prototype information in itself

[19:53] <TimToady> using "responder interface" as defined by nothingmuch

[19:53] <ruoso> the  metaclass doesnt hold the class composition 

[19:53] <ruoso> the prototype *is* the responder interface

[19:53] <TimToady> right, metaclass is generic

[19:53] <ruoso> the metaclass is the object layout

[19:53] <ruoso> in nothingmuch's terms

[19:54] <TimToady> well, I think it's more than just layout

[19:54] <TimToady> but we can split hairs later

[19:54] <ruoso> yeah... the metaclass and the prototype are quite coupled

[19:54] <ruoso> but that's hidden for each metaclass

[19:55] <ruoso> so we can decouple later

[19:55] <TimToady> nevertheless, your analysis comforts me that I did something right to invent protoobjects

[19:55] <ruoso> :)

[19:55] <ruoso> I need reviews, but it seems that this model can implement all of the specs

[19:55] <ruoso> because it doesn't implement anything

[19:55] <TimToady> because we want Dog to think it's a dog, even when it isn't.  :)

[20:00] <TimToady> and as soon as you blow stackless, you make continuations very much harder.

[20:00] <ruoso> hmm... sure...  but I wouldn't expect p5 interaction to be stackless

[20:00] <ruoso> I mean

[20:00] <ruoso> I wouldn't expect to make p5 continuations from p6

[20:01] <ruoso> I can only do what p5 supports (by p5 I really mean libperl)

[20:01] <mncharity> wolverian: the http://search.cpan.org/~bdfoy/Pod-Perldoc-ToToc-1.07/ code is quite small, and could be a good foundation.  perhaps a multi-pod combined toc module?

[20:02] <TimToady> sure, but if we can fiddle both p5 and parrot to use an alternate runloop, we might find a way to shim both into one level. just something to bear in mind

[20:03] <ruoso> I see.. maybe using different interpreter instances instead of stacking them

[20:03] <ruoso> for p5

[20:03] *** cognominal_ joined
[20:03] <ruoso> s/them/in it/

[20:04] <TimToady> hmm, that would make a rather heavy continuation, I suppose

[20:04] <ruoso> hmmm

[20:04] <ruoso> or using the trick kp6 does

[20:04] <ruoso> which is holding closures

[20:04] <ruoso> and running everything inside that closure

[20:04] <TimToady> trick is to get p5 regex engine to cough up a continuation closure for you...

[20:04] <wolverian> mncharity, yeah. unfortunately, the code is rather obtuse. :( 

[20:05] <ruoso> TimToady, fglock was dealing with it in kp6 p5rx

[20:05] <ruoso> I'm not sure how it ended

[20:05] <wolverian> hmm

[20:05] *** devogon left
[20:05] <wolverian> actually, it could be separate from smartlinks.pl 

[20:06] <TimToady> well, I think he basically did his own matching with closures

[20:06] <TimToady> at least, until the ratchet came

[20:06] <ruoso> that's the procedural version

[20:06] <ruoso> kp6 has a p5rx based version

[20:06] <TimToady> but ratchet merely reduces the need for continuation

[20:07] <TimToady> I don't profess to know how kp6 does it

[20:07] <ruoso> I'm not sure... but I think kp6-p5rx was supporting gather-take inside tokens using continuations

[20:07] <ruoso> or corountines

[20:07] <ruoso> hmm

[20:07] <ruoso> not sure

[20:07] <TimToady> iirc it was coro

[20:07] <ruoso> yeah... probably

[20:08] <ruoso> anyway

[20:08] <TimToady> but coro is in some ways not as powerful as gather/take, since you have to tie it to a sub

[20:08] <TimToady> I suspect gather/take in kp6 is limited for that reason

[20:08] <ruoso> this is to when we'll be implementing yap6-p5 integration...

[20:08] <TimToady> can you gather in one dynamic scope and take in a lower dynamic scope?

[20:08] <ruoso> yap6 needs to exist first ;)

[20:09] <ruoso> TimToady, I'm not sure, but I think you can

[20:09] <mncharity> wolverian: ok

[20:10] <mncharity> anyone: perhaps remove -noindex from whatever generates the sNN html?  Then at least one would have tables of contents in the individual sNN.

[20:10] <TimToady> well, just bear in mind that storing anything in the C stack is just going to bite you later

[20:15] <PerlJam> indeed.

[20:15] <PerlJam> That's sometimes a hard lesson to learn though

[20:27] <mncharity> further re ToC, it would be nice to have an html page with a combined table of contents for all the synopses.

[20:27] <ruoso> but I really need to go home

[20:27] <jjore-m> skids, do you still care about copying closures?

[20:27] <wolverian> mncharity, good job spotting the google search. I don't know how to fix it, unfortunately. site:feather.perl6.nl doesn't help.

[20:27] * mncharity goes to look at spec.pugscode.org ...

[20:27] <wolverian> it's the same as feather.perl6.nl/syn

[20:28] <mncharity> ah, a ToC.  happiness. :)

[20:28] <wolverian> yeah. the index page could use some love though

[20:29] <wolverian> e.g. instead of "Packages <a...>Synopsis</a> ...rest..." it could just be "<a href="syn...">Packages</a> ...rest..." 

[20:29] <wolverian> or do we want to keep the term synopsis on the index page? 

[20:29] <mncharity> and http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/synopsis.html a link to http://perlcabal.org/syn/ (/me wonders how many aliases feather has...)

[20:33] <mncharity> re link, I always suggest going for simplicity and clarity.  having a column of boldface repetitions of the word "Synopsis" is just wasted ink and distraction.

[20:33] <wolverian> I agree.

[20:34] <mncharity> re google search, let's see...

[20:34] <Juerd_> mncharity: Too many

[20:34] <Juerd_> There are too few canonical URLs for all of Perl.

[20:34] <wolverian> I agree. :)

[20:34] <Juerd_> There's a gazillion websites about Perl, gazillion minus a dozen of them are outdated

[20:35] <Juerd_> perl.org is said to be canonical, but is also a lot of outdated crap

[20:35] <Juerd_> Then there's the commercially controlled perl.com, which is even worse

[20:36] <Juerd_> The owner of perl6.org has "bigger plans" for it: a migration site

[20:37] <Juerd_> But it does have perl6 documents right now, probably to gain some google points for it.

[20:37] <Juerd_> Those are synced, but that has been broken before
