[18:22] *** pmurias joined
[18:22] *** rindolf joined
[18:23] <pmurias> what does the return type for tokens in STD mean?

[18:24] <pmurias> mncharity: i changed Emit::AstYaml to return yaml instead of printing it

[18:25] *** Tene left

[18:30] *** Psyche^ joined
[18:31] <TimToady> mncharity: yes, because assignment may be coerced to either item assignment or list assignment at "make" time.

[18:33] <TimToady> pmurias: when viewed as a method, any regex is really returning a match cursor regardless of what the user thinks is being returned

[18:33] <TimToady> so the return type on a regex is really the coercion of the "make" object

[18:35] <TimToady> which ends up in the scalar slot of the match object (or the match object implicitly contained within a cursor)

[18:36] <TimToady> so it's really the coercion of that Match object, whether or not there was a make()

[18:37] <TimToady> (probably)

[18:38] <TimToady> it's a little bit strange the way currently envisioned

[18:38] <TimToady> it makes more sense to coerce $/ when there's no make, but when there's a make it might make more sense to coerce $$/

[18:40] <TimToady> factoring into this is that under various semantics of :keepall, we want to hold onto the Match as well as the scalar object, so you can't just throw away the Match when you do a make necessarily

[18:43] <pmurias> i read more of STD and understood what are the types for

[18:46] <TimToady> when I say "coerce" I'm really meaning something more like mixins

[18:47] <TimToady> that is, not so much to change the type, but to add in info such as prec and assoc...

[18:48] <TimToady> except we're kinda adding that into the Match object, not the make object, so there's something screwy somewhere in my thinking (not unusual)

[18:50] <TimToady> I suppose I should call it the result object to be consistent

[18:50] <TimToady> anyway, the match object and the result object keep fighting with each other

[19:00] <pmurias> and script/kp6 needs a refactor

[19:03] <mncharity> TimToady: in STD.pm, 'regex prefix_circumfix_meta_operator:reduce'  is the only categoryfoo:bar instance which is a regex.  could it be a token or rule instead?

[19:05] <mncharity> TimToady: Q2... feel free to suggest a different communication strategy - the current one is "/me mentions oddities as they go by":), rather than distinguishing "blockers - or things which will cost me time" from "hmm, that's odd".

[19:06] <mncharity> Q2 - there are only a few things which are "regex", so going down the   egrep '^regex' STD.pm  list,

[19:07] <mncharity> could  nofat  be a token instead?  it's just two <before>s.

[19:08] <mncharity> regex fulltypename also seems like it could be a token?

[19:09] <mncharity> re "in STD.pm, 'regex prefix_circumfix_meta_operator:reduce'  is the only categoryfoo:bar instance which is a regex.  could it be a token or rule instead?", never mind.  already asked, answered, and was documented in a comment even before that.  sorry.

[19:10] <mncharity> 'regex stdstopper' however isn't marked as backtracking.

[19:11] <mncharity> So 3 "why is this a regex?" oddities (outside of the quoting stuff): nofat fulltypename stdstopper

[19:39] <TimToady> mncharity: it's possible that prefix_circumfix_meta_operator:reduce won't have to backtrack if we can shove all possible reduce combinations into LTM, but it might get too combinatorial, esp if the user adds more infix metaoperators that can be inside/outside other metaops

[20:10] <mncharity> (that last for smilely, the new statement terminator)

[20:13] <mncharity> TimToady: the yaml dump which gimme5 drops in DATA, any guidance on whether it is complete, is correct?

[20:14] * mncharity considers making an oo (and thus yaml) representation of STD, to do more analysis.  Eg, a big table of ruls vs do they have code?  use env vars (and which)?  participate in OOP?  etc.

[20:16] *** jferrero joined
[20:18] <b_jonas> S03 says "postcircumfix" at some places, so the right terminology might be precircumfix_meta_operator

[20:18] <b_jonas> which is shorter

[20:18] <b_jonas> though it also says prefix_circumfix_meta_operator explicitly

[20:20] <b_jonas> (when it comes to meta-operators syntax, I like J's grammar. It's simple, but enough for almost all practical purposes.)

[20:21] <TimToady> the long ones are long on purpose

[20:21] <TimToady> the longer they are, the less you should be messin' with 'em

[20:21] <b_jonas> (though as very few languages have meta-operators syntax, I suppose I could say perl6 has stolen the idea from APL or a descendant)

[20:22] <TimToady> hmm, I'd say it's independent discovery

[20:22] <b_jonas> really? 

[20:22] <b_jonas> I mean, even the most popular ones are the same

[20:23] *** BinGOs joined
[20:23] <b_jonas> the first meta-operators apl had were / (reduce), \ (scan), and . (matrix product)

[20:23] <b_jonas> iirc

[20:24] <b_jonas> whereas perl6 has reduce, scan, and what else?

[20:24] <pmurias> hyper

[20:24] <TimToady> I never really studied APL; closest I got to it was watching my brother-in-law implement a PDP-11 interpreter for it

[20:24] <TimToady> and assign ops reclassified to metaop

[20:25] <TimToady> likewise negation

[20:25] <TimToady> $a !eq $b

[20:25] <b_jonas> btw, I mean stealing in the good sense: http://www.undefined.net/1/0/

[20:25] <lambdabot> Title: 1/0 Archives

[20:25] <TimToady> understand that

[20:25] <b_jonas> ah yeah, negation

[20:25] <TimToady> but mostly I was just generalizing from op= in my head

[20:26] <TimToady> and initially it was just hyperops

[20:26] <TimToady> reduce came later

[20:26] <b_jonas> apart from perl6, I've only seen that as a meta-op in Arc

[20:27] <b_jonas> ah yeah, the map operator

[20:27] <b_jonas> that's in Apl too of course

[20:27] <b_jonas> I knew I forgot something

[20:27] <TimToady> mostly my exposure to APL was way back in the MEGO days, so I don't recall every learning that there were metaops

[20:27] <b_jonas> though old Apl, Apl with boxes, Apl2/J, and Perl6 does the map thing in different ways

[20:27] <b_jonas> MEGO?

[20:27] <TimToady> My Eyes Glaze Over

[20:28] <TimToady> I was mostly just a BASIC programmer back then

[20:28] <TimToady> more than 30 years ago...

[20:29] <b_jonas> if you discovered them independently, that's nice though

[20:29] <TimToady> most of my original functional notions came from Lisp, at least on the conscious level

[20:29] <b_jonas> because I really admire how Ken Iverson choose the right primitives

[20:30] <b_jonas> and how he could remove the primitives that turned out to be unnecessary

[20:31] <b_jonas> (a very old paper lists some functions that were removed)

[20:31] <b_jonas> (that was before Apl got implemented on a computer)

[20:31] <TimToady> well, hey, everyone refactors occasionally...

[20:32] <b_jonas> (link: http://www.jsoftware.com/jwiki/Doc/A_Source_Book_in_APL )

[20:32] <lambdabot> Title: Doc/A Source Book in APL - J Wiki

[20:33] <TimToady> the problem with a mathematician refactoring is that they tend to factor out the humanistic shortcuts, which renders a language usable only by geniuses

[20:34] <b_jonas> I'd like a language with Apl's primitives BUT real lambdas

[20:34] <b_jonas> K has gone too far from Apl in that respect

[20:34] <b_jonas> let me say, I'd like one with Apl2/J's primitives and syntax rules BUT real lambdas

[20:35] <TimToady> mncharity: it's a complete parse of the tokens/rules for purposes of LTM generation, but the p6 code ends up translated outside of DATA

[20:35] <b_jonas> (though the bigger problem with K is the lack of documentation)

[20:36] <TimToady> I prefer a language with a few more precedence levels  :)

[20:37] <pmurias> TimToady: you wouldn't like mp6

[20:37] <pmurias> ;)

[20:37] <TimToady> anyway, speaking of precedence, I really need to commute to $dayjob

[20:43] *** BinGOs joined
[20:46] *** meppl joined
[20:47] <mncharity> STD: 656 ruls, routines, and classes.  sigh.

[20:48] <b_jonas> TimToady: if in perl6 you can assign precedence to operators returned by hyper-operators, 

[20:48] <b_jonas> then you could in theory make a langauge with apl's primitives, meta-operators, but percedence-ful syntax.

[20:48] <b_jonas> whether that'd be better or worse than apl is not trivial.

[20:49] <mncharity>  /me wishes for a  all_the_information_in_STD_made_easily_accessible.pm .

[20:51] *** Psyche^ joined
[20:56] *** Psyche^_ joined
[20:56] <PerlJam> mncharity: Just write something that can parse STD.pm and the introspection bits and there you go!

[20:57] <PerlJam> mncharity: and by my estimation, PGE and friends get you more than half way there.

[20:57] <b_jonas> so perl6 has an outer product metaoperator by default (S03) but not an inner/matrix product metaoperator

[20:58] *** Chillance joined
[20:58] <b_jonas> and it has a less potent "hyperoperator"

[20:58] <b_jonas> than apl

[20:58] <b_jonas> so this is the difference

[21:00] <b_jonas> does perl6 have "boxes" so you can use the hyper-operator in a more powerful way?

[21:01] <pmurias> b_jonas: what are "boxes"

[21:01] <pmurias> ?

[21:02] <b_jonas> pmurias: in itself, a box is just a simple container type that holds a single value, with the only interesting operations being boxing and unboxing

[21:03] <b_jonas> but where it gets interesting is that you can have the map/hyper operator behave specially on it

[21:03] <b_jonas> in that it unboxes elements but doesn't propagate in the boxes

[21:03] <b_jonas> the perl6 hyper-operator acts recursively on multi-dimensional arrays

[21:03] <b_jonas> but it could stop at the first level of boxes

[21:04] <b_jonas> this way, you can do ranked operations the apl way

[21:04] <b_jonas> I'd give an example but that would be flooding so I'll try to paste one somewhere

[21:05] *** dduncan joined
[21:06] <pmurias> mncharity: i wander if it wouldn't be wiser if one intended for a perl6 subset eqivalent sematicly to perl5 instead of trying to bootstrap kp6 just to revive mp6 

[21:07] <mncharity> re 'alf way there', STD_extract is already sort of half way there.  and cheat/gimme5 a different half+.  need to be combined and expanded.  not so much a technical challenge, as... pause

[21:08] <pmurias> s/wander/wonder/

[21:08] <mncharity> pmurias: good thought.  my working hypothesis is

[21:09] <mncharity> hmm, the challenge is to attract developers.  else we just end up with yet another dead p6 implementation.

[21:09] *** dduncan left
[21:09] <mncharity> yadp6i

[21:11] <mncharity> one way to do that would be to "it's the full, real, spec grammar".  "any spec p6 which doesn't parse, is a mistake, easily fixed working in {p5,p6}".

[21:11] <mncharity> and work from there towards a sane ast's, and ir's.

[21:13] <mncharity> a STD-based parser would thus provide a "place to stand".  one point of non-"assortedly broken bootstrap kludgery".

[21:14] *** qmole joined
[21:14] <pmurias> is just "it yet another silly subset" aspect scarying people of p6 implementations? 

[21:16] <mncharity> I'm a great believer in bootstrap kludgery. :)  as a techincal approach.  but I think we have a social, not technical problem at the moment.  too many years of "it sort <break - yes, what you said>" seem to have killed developer interest.

[21:16] <pmurias> or are implementations issues such as being forced to work in horid languages such as mp6 or pir more important

[21:17] <mncharity> that's my impression.  could be wrong.  interested what you think.  re 'or', hmm...

[21:17] <mncharity> both?

[21:19] <pmurias> what do you mean by "it sort <break - yes, what you said>"?

[21:19] <mncharity> I was trying to figure out how to say "it yet another silly subset", when you did. :)

[21:20] <mncharity> s/did/said it, so I could stop/

[21:21] <pmurias> ;)

[21:22] <mncharity> horrid has two impacts.  it raises the effort and motivation required.  and it reduces clarity.  "clarity" being the obviousness of "this isn't just another dead-end subset".

[21:26] <mncharity> A pugs-level capability implementation written in p5/Moose might be viable.  But kp6-level is apparently not.  I had hoped a something in between, with good usablity, might be viable.  But got stuck for lack of a usable parser.  If one needs to

[21:28] <mncharity> fight the parser battle anyway, the best chance of finding anyone to work with, and of the result being used, and of an implementation based on it attracting developers, is something STD-based.  Even if parts of it are still a work in progress.

[21:30] <pmurias> getting STD to work is a bit of a bottleneck

[21:31] <mncharity> true.  but mostly in the EXPR handling.  

[21:34] <mncharity> my hope is/was having  all_the_information_in_STD_made_easily_accessible.pm would let you easily do things like, "ok, here are the n rules into which EXPR handling leaks.  let's try making progress by avoiding the EXPR wall.  rip out the cruft, drop in a simple OPP, move on".

[21:34] <mncharity> s/easily do/easily try/

[21:35] <b_jonas> http://hpaste.org/6452

[21:35] <b_jonas> pmurias: http://hpaste.org/6452 explains boxing combined with apl's each (diaresis) operator

[21:35] <pmurias> you mean being able to just take a few rules out of STD conveniently

[21:37] *** larsen joined
[21:39] <pmurias> i see, having all the interactions between rules easily visible

[21:39] <mncharity> yes.  for example.  with ~700 components, and implicit relationships (eg, using environment variables), and "it really wouldn't work as written" (STD_red got hit here), and it's hard to tell the consequences of changes (eg, implementing | as ||, or punting non-local longest-DFA-ness, or replacing that with lookahead, or...)...

[21:40] <pmurias> EXPR dosn't seem especialy simple

[21:40] <mncharity> it's just not a managable exercise with better infrastructure.

[21:40] <pmurias> s/simple/complex/

[21:42] <mncharity> which to get back to PerlJam's observation, isn't particularly technically difficult to create (re all_the_information_in_STD_made_easily_accessible.pm), but... I'm getting burned out on "here I am restarting work on something I was doing n months/years ago, no one has

[21:42] <mncharity> touched it in the interrum, and no one is interested in working on it with me, so it would be yet another solo p6 slog".

[21:42] <b_jonas> dunno if that description make sense

[21:43] <b_jonas> also dunno if it would make sense in p6

[21:44] <mncharity> re 'EXPR dosn't seem especialy complex', the difficulty is more that it's no local.  leaking into things like

[21:45] <mncharity> token noun's <variable> line.

[21:45] <mncharity>     | <variable> { $<sigil> = $<variable><sigil> }

[21:46] <mncharity> and all the rules (how many?  which?  dunno) which are doing $<prec> passing.

[21:49] <mncharity> STD_red was sort of based on "I don't *have* to know 'how many?', 'which?', 'are some missing?', 'what would need to be changed to modify it?'".  "I just transliterate what's there in STD.pm, and if any of it doesn't work, that's someone else's task to fix, and it is likely to happen fairly quickly".

[21:51] <mncharity> those assumptions/speculations turned out not to be true, so STD_red got rather less interesting, and STD analysis tools again rather more so.

[21:55] <mncharity> re 'EXPR dosn't seem especialy complex', maybe not.  looks like there are only 8-ish things with <prec>.

[21:56] <mncharity> some things like   token infix:sym<=> () { <sym> { self.<sigil> eq '$'?? make Item_assignment($/) !! make List_assignment($/); } {*} }   which need to be massaged into something else.

[22:00] <mncharity> ./STD5_run EXPR -e '3 = 4'  isn't working at the moment.  '3 - 4' does.

[22:00] <mncharity> s/at the moment/yet/

[22:00] <mncharity> basically there's a bunch of details, and a lot of clutter obscuring them.

[22:01] <mncharity> and that's _before_ starting to debug - in just writing the code intended to run.

[22:03] <pmurias> maybe OPP should abstracted in a module instead of being scattered around

[22:04] <mncharity> b_jonas: re boxing, it's on my infinite todo list for p6, along with a full apl implementation.  but... not any time soon.

[22:04] <b_jonas> mncharity: by "full apl implementation" do you mean completely unrelated to perl6?

[22:05] <mncharity> though sooner than you might think, because one way to demonstrate "we're finally real now" with clarity is to be running, and fully passing, other languages' test suites.  and past work suggests a well spec'ed and test suited language can be _very_ easy to implement in p6.

[22:06] <b_jonas> I want to write a J implementation but that's really long term so might not happen

[22:06] <mncharity> re unrelated, well, sort of.  p6 can do  { use Apl; ...<this is apl code>... }.   so that, rather than language blending, which is a much harder exercise.

[22:07] *** Limbic_Region joined
[22:07] <b_jonas> yeah

[22:08] <b_jonas> except for the closing brace I guess

[22:08] <mncharity> sub sortit (@X) { use Apl; X[↑X+.≠' ';] }

[22:08] <b_jonas> what I meant is, it's not like adding apl operators and higher-order operators to the p6 grammar with a module

[22:09] <mncharity> right.  doing that is a harder, much more artistic, language design exercise.

[22:09] <b_jonas> yeah

[22:09] <mncharity> embedding is just legwork.

[22:17] <mncharity> re 'look different', one issue would be the "how is OPP information being passed around via Match objects", which was discussed earlier today as a uncertainty.  ...

[22:17] <mncharity> hmm, left room.  ...

[22:20] <mncharity> well, aside from details, a big picture issue is that with a real full p6 impl, parts of STD.pm might go away, becoming artifacts of the macro or sub declarations they serve.  eg, a real prelude might(?) have a  macro statement_control:if is parsed as ... {...}.   which generates the current statement_control:if token.

[22:23] <b_jonas> I was wrong in the precedence

[22:23] <b_jonas> then I'll have to look up how precedence worked in apl

[22:24] <mncharity> my impression the current areas of uncertainty are () passing info via Match objects, () how to do mostly-non-backtracking DFA-ish parsing, () or if you don't, whether and how you lose, and how that might be worked around, () ...?

[22:25] <mncharity> () actually testing and debugging it ("if it isn't tested, it doesn't work", so each time a new section gets tested, issues turn up.

[22:28] <mncharity> for difficulty rather than uncertainty, there's also () dealing with all the many bits of inline code, including translating them as to another language if necessary, () attaching all the rule labels named in #='s.

[22:28] <b_jonas> but I'm quite sure the up arrow is wrong, it should be delta stile

[22:29] <mncharity>  /me wonders if someone is providing a website on which one can easily run small apl programs.

[22:30] <b_jonas> mncharity: there's one for J

[22:30] <b_jonas> I can find its link if you need it

[22:30] <b_jonas> (but it's easier to use the irc bots evaluating J)

[22:30] <mncharity> not needed

[22:30] <mncharity> apl irc bots?  nifty.:)

[22:32] <b_jonas> mncharity: I don't know any for apl, but there might exist one

[22:32] <b_jonas> though most apl implementations being non-free might hinder that

[22:32] <b_jonas> but there's a bot running mathematica too, so who knows

[22:33] <b_jonas> there are bots for J

[22:33] <b_jonas> however, there are shareware J interpreters you can run locally

[22:33] <mncharity> pmurias: so, if you would be interested in working on a  all_the_information_in_STD_made_easily_accessible.pm , or have any questions, just let me know.

[22:34] <b_jonas> once you write the apl thing for perl6, we'll have it in the perl6 evalbot easily

[22:37] <mncharity> grabbing bits from http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/misc/winter_jig/STD/STD_extract (careful parse of STD), plus http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/src/perl6/cheat and http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/src/perl6/gimme5 (for the regexp pattern parse tree).  plus some oo classes to represent the assorted rules, and answer questions about them.

[22:39] <mncharity> are you part of a tree?  gimme your tree to a p5 regexp.  list your subrules.  do you have any code?  do any of your subrules take arguments?  do you use any of the environment variables?  which?  etc.

[22:40] <b_jonas> though for small programs, we could try to write a quick-and-dirty mini apl-interpreter

[22:41] <mncharity> basically, cheat+gimme5 should be able to be refactored into part which understands what STD.pm says, and a separate part which emits a parser representing certain policy choices (like target language, how backtracking and lookahead are handled, how #= nodes are labeled, etc).

[22:44] <mncharity> But, I need to find someone to work with in order to pursue it.  Alternately, if someone would like to work together on something else plausible, that could be good too.

[22:44] <TimToady> I think retargetability is outside the scope of a gimme5 approach.  whole point is to scrap gimme5 as soon as STD can parse itself.

[22:45] <Limbic_Region> feeling any better TimToady?

[22:46] <TimToady> it's amazing how much better one feels when one isn't down a half a gallon's worth of blood

[22:46] <mncharity> "a gimme5 approach" meaning a code s///ing approach?

[22:46] * Limbic_Region won't asked where they stuck the dip stick to take the reading

[22:46] <TimToady> I can walk uphill again without going anaerobic...

[22:47] <Limbic_Region> that might have been funnier if I hadn't made the grammatical typo

[22:47] <TimToady> mncharity: yes, it's not really a true parser except for the p6 regexen

[22:47] <TimToady> well, I've already had a dipstick from the top end; get to wait a couple weeks for the other end...

[22:48] <TimToady> basically, they don't know why yet, though the blood tests indicate leakage

[22:48] <TimToady> as opposed to excessive destruction or inadequate creation

[22:48] <TimToady> CT scan negative, upper endo negative

[22:48] <Limbic_Region> yeah, I read that in the p6 irc logs

[22:48] <TimToady> lungs and heart fine

[22:49] <TimToady> can still be 5 or 6 common things

[22:51] <TimToady> mncharity: but yet, for p5 it's just s///ing the heck out of it rather than attempting a parse/emit, since p5 is a closely enough related language to get away with it (for this purpose only)

[22:51] <TimToady> *yes

[22:51] <mncharity> cheat/gimme5 seems a couple of distinct bits.  the file-specific "parsing", the regex parsing, the getting access to the information therein which you care about, and the emitting parser code.

[22:51] <mncharity> if gimme5 could parse STD, that would take care of the parse steps, but

[22:51] <b_jonas> wait

[22:52] <b_jonas> apl has the same precedence rule as J?

[22:52] <b_jonas> I always thought it had a different one

[22:52] <TimToady> if gimme5 could parse STD, I'd pretty much have a Perl 6 parser :)

[22:52] <mncharity> if you needed something else to parse STD as well, you would still need the "get access to the info", and the "emit something else" bits.

[22:52] <TimToady> but I'd rather think of the output of gimme5 as a real p6 parser, not gimme5 :)

[22:54] <b_jonas> I'll look up if it was always like that or changed in apl2

[22:54] <mncharity> at one point gimme5 looked like a DFA research project.  is that still true, or has confidence in the approach increased?

[22:54] <TimToady> that part is very nearly done, I think, apart from maybe refactoring the actual interfaces between rules as we go along

[22:55] <TimToady> the main blocker on LTM is just that I haven't propagated a* b patterns right yet

[22:55] <b_jonas> yep, this old document says it was always like in J

[22:55] <TimToady> so that I know where a*b can mean ab

[22:55] <b_jonas> I don't know why I imagined otherwise

[22:56] <TimToady> currently a*b doesn't know how to propagate the b prefixes upward

[22:56] <b_jonas> useful to know

[22:56] <TimToady> the Match/Result confusion mentioned earlier is the other main blocker

[22:57] <mncharity> so gimme5 might become a real p6 parser, rsn, for some value of rsn?

[22:57] <TimToady> I think so

[22:57] <TimToady> well, the output of gimme5 rather :)

[22:57] <TimToady> gimme5 will always just be chewing gum and bailing wire

[22:58] <TimToady> as far as the actual design issues with STD

[22:58] <TimToady> the string sublanguage stuff is likely to undergo an amount of refactoring

[22:59] <TimToady> more generally, the relationships of various sibling sublanguages has to be tracked correctly

[22:59] <mncharity> relationships?

[22:59] <TimToady> for instance, a regex containing {...} should use the same p6 variant that was outside the regex

[23:00] <mncharity> ah

[23:00] <TimToady> and that might itself be a derived language, just as regex is

[23:00] <mncharity> err, p6 variant...  of quoting?

[23:00] <TimToady> some of this is solved with virtual classes

[23:00] <mncharity> ah, ok

[23:00] <TimToady> quoting is just one way of mixing up various derived or related languages

[23:01] <b_jonas> can't some of that be solved by the string parser handling back the work to the parent parser when it sees a brace?

[23:01] <b_jonas> I think that's how it works in ruby

[23:01] <TimToady> but again, if you interpolate an expression, say, the langauge inside the expr has to be the same as outside the quote

[23:02] <TimToady> it's not exactly just "handing back"

[23:02] <TimToady> the inner expr just starts out in the outer language, but could itself mutate within its lexical scope

[23:02] <TimToady> that must automatically restore at the outer scope

[23:03] <b_jonas> yeah, it's simpler in ruby where the only such case is catenating something to a string

[23:03] <TimToady> it's not that the inner expr is passed to the outer parser

[23:03] <TimToady> it's that the inner expr starts parsing with the same parser, but might diverge

[23:03] <mncharity> why isn't the language inside the expr just whatever is in  our Perl $*PARSER  or somesuch?

[23:03] <TimToady> this goes for an lexical subscope, not just interpolations or eval

[23:04] <b_jonas> so it's easy to just treat '"foo @{[' as '"foo " . ' with the extra thing that if the normal parser meets the closing brace, it hands the work back to the string parser

[23:04] <mncharity> my Perl $*PARSER  then?

[23:04] <b_jonas> hmm

[23:04] <TimToady> something like that

[23:05] <mncharity> but before my "relationships?" question sidelined us, you were listing "as far as the actual design issues with STD"...

[23:05] <TimToady> more likely $?PARSER, since it becomes a constant at run time

[23:06] <mncharity> refactoring string sublanguage stuff; tracking relationships of various sibling sublanguages; ...?

[23:06] <TimToady> the third one is basically the maundering in the comments at the front about how to use a language module and then derive from it, and how all the linkage works

[23:06] <TimToady> such as, how do you tell the APL grammar to stop on an unmatched }   :)

[23:07] <b_jonas> that's what I tried to say above when I said "except for the closing brace"

[23:07] <TimToady> indeed, the optimal situation is if all parsing is one-pass like that

[23:07] <b_jonas> the APL grammar could stop on some closing marker native to apl, and then require a brace

[23:07] <b_jonas> or something

[23:07] <TimToady> rather than trying to find the end of a quoted region and reparsing

[23:08] <b_jonas> because just a closing brace could be valid in that language

[23:08] <TimToady> this is a mistake p5 made on several levels, looking for the end of a construct and then reparsing

[23:09] <b_jonas> TimToady: oh yeah, that's what ruby actually does differently in string interpolation

[23:09] <TimToady> so yes, there has to be something that is the natural terminator in the sublanguage

[23:09] <b_jonas> the interpolated code can contain the same quote marker

[23:09] <mncharity> so of those, the ones standing between us and gimme5's output being able to parse say kp6 source files, is a*b propagation and regularizing Match/Return?

[23:09] <b_jonas> or it can contain braces if it's inside expressions

[23:09] <TimToady> p6 can do that too, now that we do everything one-pass

[23:09] <b_jonas> but it's easier there because a closing brace (which closes the interpolation) is also a closing delimiter in ruby

[23:09] <b_jonas> whereas in a random langauge, it could be valid in itself

[23:10] <TimToady> mncharity: well, and the fact that nothing is tested :)

[23:10] <mncharity> testing I can do :)

[23:10] <TimToady> but once I had the LTM stuff in hand I felt that the rest was mostly a small matter of programming

[23:11] <b_jonas> I don't even know what the syntax should be for an embedded J expression

[23:11] <b_jonas> because the native closing delimiter in J would be a )

[23:11] <b_jonas> but then you still need the closing brace or it would look ugly

[23:12] <b_jonas> I guess it would be like

[23:12] <TimToady> the OPP is a bit more complex than a standard binary-operator OPP, since it needs to take into account list precedence and such, but I think EXPR is close to correct there

[23:12] <b_jonas> { use J;

[23:12] <b_jonas> foo

[23:12] <b_jonas> bar

[23:12] <b_jonas> )

[23:12] <b_jonas> }

[23:12] <TimToady> s/precedence/associativity/

[23:13] <TimToady> b_jonas: I'd say for something like that you'd rather have a macro that has its own idea of delimiters apart from {...}

[23:13] <b_jonas> yep

[23:13] <TimToady> just as a Python macro might just arrange to stop with sufficient outdent

[23:13] <mncharity> re Match/Return, the options seem to be () hang info on the side ($<side> = whatever), () stuff info in scalar value stash, () operators return instances of a mutant Match class which stores the extra info, () ...something else..?

[23:14] <b_jonas> maybe you'd embed small J snippets with a macro with a short name, like, j(foobar)

[23:14] <TimToady> that would be preferable to either two-pass parse or bending {...} all out of recognition :)

[23:15] <b_jonas> (though there's the more difficult problem of passing data in and out)

[23:16] <TimToady> possibly solved with feeds

[23:17] <TimToady> but there's no reason a macro could involve a call into a signature parser too

[23:17] <TimToady> *couldn't

[23:17] <TimToady> yet another of those little sublanguages :)

[23:18] <b_jonas> well, you could call back p6 from j too, and then the only problem is conversion of data types

[23:18] <b_jonas> no need to share a namespace or anything like that

[23:19] <mncharity> $<_opp_cruft_> = { :prec<...>, :assoc<...> }

[23:19] <mncharity> $<_opp_cruft_> = $my_childs<_opp_cruft_>

[23:20] <mncharity> $<opp_data> ;)

[23:21] <TimToady> not sure what you're getting at, but sure, you gotta propagate stuff up to where the opp can see it somehow or other

[23:22] *** gbarr_ joined
[23:22] <TimToady> and there's some complexity involved in getting 1..100 :by(2) to attach the :by(2) to the ..

[23:23] <TimToady> which is what "thisop" is about

[23:23] <mncharity> I'm suggesting passing the opp info on the side, rather than make()ing it.  and perhaps doing so with a single field, rather than having separate $<prec> and $<assoc> scattered.

[23:24] <mncharity> s/scattered/inlined/

[23:26] <TimToady> which is pretty much back to the nature of coercion vs match objects again

[23:27] <TimToady> it's quite probable that the objects' prec and assoc should be attributes and not hash values

[23:27] <TimToady> in which case you're more like mixins

[23:27] *** eternaleye_ joined
[23:28] <TimToady> and the opp state is more like a role

[23:29] <mncharity> I'm also a bit tempted by the locality of having a find_this_Match_objects_precedence() helper, which hypothetically digs down for the info, rather than what I worry might be an escalating set of rules being affected ("oh, were going to need the info there too, so we'll have to pass it trough x, and y, and z").

[23:29] <TimToady> which is, in fact, how it's written in STD at the PrecOp level, but we could extend that down further

[23:31] <mncharity> so  replace_current_Match_object_with(MatchMutant.new_from(current_Match_object,...random extra info...)) ?

[23:31] <TimToady> but if you do that you have to either have the intelligence outside the reduction logic, or reenter it somehow

[23:32] <TimToady> well, that's more or less what the current cursor code is doing anyway

[23:34] <TimToady> though I don't remember to what extent the current cursor* methods that are checked in do that; my copy has diverged a bit

[23:36] <TimToady> actually, it would have been the matchify code hauling the info along as pseudo match entries

[23:36] <mncharity> if one generalize Match's name(), to point to the actual rule object, rather than just its name, then it would be unsurprising for the Match()s generated by operators to point to such an object, and to find prec/assoc information there.

[23:37] <TimToady> was trying to avoid calling a method every time EXPR wants to compare prec or assoc, but it's probably a false economy

[23:38] <TimToady> could cache those in the stacks anyway if they needed to be faster

[23:38] <mncharity> so I guess that's a 4th option, () keep it in rul objects linked from an objectified name().

[23:39] <mncharity> s/keep it/keep assoc/prec/

[23:39] <TimToady> 'course, now your little yaml dump of the match dumps the entire grammar :/

[23:40] <TimToady> but that's probably just the problem of using yaml

[23:40] <TimToady> rather than a more appropriate transform/emitter

[23:41] <TimToady> likely it's easier to track a rule pointer through the cursor than various splatter'd values

[23:42] <mncharity> currently works (i fuzzily recall).  walks the tree, deleting such yaml-problematic nodes, before dumping.  a custom emitter is probably more the "right thing" from a yaml perspective.

[23:42] <mncharity> s/nodes/fields/

[23:42] <TimToady> matchify is done at rule reduction time, so it doesn't complicate .prior tracking

[23:43] <TimToady> (.prior only threads on actual bindings, not all intermediate states)

[23:44] <TimToady> so collecting the match data should be fairly efficient, and we can manage the rule pointer at the same sequence points

[23:44] *** devogon_ joined
[23:44] <mncharity> name() should probably be objectified even if it isn't used for this, just so it can be used with anon rules.  if you wan't the name, ask the rule for it.  and how that interacts with rebinding... makes my head hurt.  rb 1.9 has two separate bits of info available inside

[23:45] <mncharity> a method - what name were you defined as, and what name were you called as.

[23:45] <TimToady> um, "name" in Cursor5 is not the name of hte rule

[23:46] <TimToady> it's the name we'll be bound to

[23:46] <mncharity> oh?  oops.  hmm.

[23:46] <mncharity> "the name we'll be bound to" in the enclosing Match object?

[23:46] <TimToady> so ends up the key in the outer match obj's hash

[23:47] <TimToady> but we don't have that hash yet

[23:47] <mncharity> so our Match's have no memory at present of what rule created them?

[23:47] <TimToady> so a cursor can remember the name it's being bound to, and matchify is what actually constructs the Match later

[23:48] <TimToady> and only cursors with a "name" are threaded on .prior pointers

[23:50] <TimToady> but we do need the rule pointer in any case, just for accountability and good error messages, so leaving the prec there might make sense.

[23:50] <TimToady> gotta think about that in terms of whether it has any impact on grammar extensibility

[23:52] <mncharity> re 'just for accountability and good error messages', it also makes subsequent use of the Match tree much easier.  having a node self declare 'i am a variable!', rather than having to infer it from 'well, my parent has me in a field named x, and I myself have fields name y and z, so maybe I'm a variable?'.  or

[23:53] <mncharity> having the rules decorate the matches rule foo { ... {$<rule>=self}}.  though if there was an easy way to make that happen, that would be fine too.

[23:54] <mncharity> re extensibility, oh, hmm.
