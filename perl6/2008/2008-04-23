[01:06] <[particle]> i guess so. i don't know if it's been up since the last time i reported it

[01:08] <ispy_> So, I'm thinking of writing a little pet project website using Rakudo and HTML::Mason.  Am I crazy? :)

[01:10] <[particle]> aren't we all?

[01:13] *** thestarslookdown left
[01:14] <ispy_> That's the answer I was looking for...

[01:14] <Auzon> Well, do all the functions of HTML::Mason that you need work in Rakudo?

[01:15] <ispy_> I haven't gotten further than entertaining the idea... I'm attempting to configure my environment now.  We'll see...

[01:16] <ispy_> It would be kinda cool :)

[01:24] <Juerd> [particle]: I'm not fixing it because I don't know where/how/whta

[13:54] <audreyt> Juerd: I've upgraded Jifty in feather to 0.80408 (it was somehow downgraded to 0.70416). commitbit is now back

[13:55] <audreyt> (as indicated in /tmp/commitbit.log)

[13:55] <perl_Coke> audreyt++

[13:55] <PerlJam> audreyt!  How goes?  LTNS.

[13:56] <audreyt> goes okay :)

[13:57] <PerlJam> Good to hear ... er, see  :)

[13:57] <[particle]> audreyt++

[13:58] * [particle] fires off a commit bit to Auzon

[13:58] <audreyt> hi [particle] :) great to see rakudo doing very well! Vienna.pm++ especially, for funding jonathan

[13:59] <[particle]> indeed. vienna.pm++

[14:00] <[particle]> now if only real life weren't getting in my way....

[14:00] <[particle]> but you know how that story goes.

[14:00] <audreyt> oh, only too well.

[14:00] <audreyt> <- still overloaded 120% in real life.

[14:00] <[particle]> upgrade to dual core, and minimize to the system tray

[14:02] <audreyt> nah, my brain's concurrency core is too unsafe

[14:02] <audreyt> upgrading to dual core would induce instant schizophrenia, 'mfraid.

[14:02] <kolibrie> audreyt: good to see you again!

[14:02] <audreyt> now minimizing to system tray, that sounds like what I've been doing :)

[14:03] <audreyt> hi kolibrie

[14:03] <masak> :)

[14:03] <masak> good to see you again, audreyt

[14:03] <audreyt> ditto

[14:06] <Juerd> audreyt: Great to see you here!

[14:06] <Juerd> audreyt: How are you?

[14:07] <Juerd> Oh, you already answered that

[14:07] <Juerd> I'm glad that things go well.

[14:07] <audreyt> yeah. just very busy.

[14:08] <Juerd> Can you handle it?

[14:08] * Juerd recently couldn't, and had to drop a few projects.

[14:08] <audreyt> indeed, I've dropped all other projects :)

[14:08] <Juerd> That works too

[14:09] <audreyt> in my spare time I've been refactoring pugs into very small bits and release them all over hackage, which is useful for lambdafolks, but nothing exciting p6 wise.

[14:09] <audreyt> you get the same pugs, except in manageable chunks.

[14:09] <[particle]> that'd be a first!

[14:10] <audreyt> well, it's useful for other haskell projects.

[14:10] <[particle]> manageable++

[14:10] <[particle]> sure

[14:10] * PerlJam wonders what a managable chunk of pugs looks like ...

[14:10] * perl_Coke hands PerlJam a 'g'

[14:11] <audreyt> PerlJam: for example, http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/MetaObject-0.0.1 is the object system, http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/HsPerl5-0.0.3 is the perl5 bridge

[14:11] <PerlJam> I like the 's'

[14:11] <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/68x57m

[14:11] <audreyt> there's also some bits for fast memoized string tables

[14:11] <PerlJam> oh, I see.  My mind went a totally different direction when you talked about pugs chunks.

[14:12] <audreyt> some parser stuff being reworked based on tdfa

[14:12] <audreyt> etc.

[14:12] <wolverian> oh, wow, YAML reference impl in haskell is on hackage 

[14:12] <audreyt> hackage is becoming an unsearchable mess not unlike other comprehensive archives ;)

[14:13] *** alester joined
[14:13] <audreyt> there's a SoC for it, like many other things these days... but Hoogle and Hayoo! doesn't really work well atm

[14:16] <audreyt> unfortunately I'll hve to go offline to work on more slides for $job. *wave*

[14:33] <Alias_> hey audreyt

[14:34] <Alias_> If I point google at you, will you write boring stable easily  maintained standard stuff, or crazy advanced audreyt magic that someone else will have to maintain :)

[14:45] *** iblechbot joined
[14:48] <ispy_> What's up gang.

[14:53] <audreyt> Alias_: very likely, boring standard stuff.

[14:53] <audreyt> since most perl I write for $job these days passes as boring maintainable standard stuff :)

[14:54] <audreyt> I've lifted the crazy magic into haskell land where they are considered "sane"...

[14:57] <ispy_> audreyt: Do you work for Best Practical?

[14:58] <audreyt> ispy_: every now and then, but not primarily

[14:58] <ispy_> I was just curious :)

[14:58] <ispy_> Thanks.

[14:59] <audreyt> np :) Alias_: maybe take it to email since I need to go offline for real :) &

[15:01] <[particle]> heh. good to see audrey's world is still the same. offline == email.
