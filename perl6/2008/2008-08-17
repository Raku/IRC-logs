[13:40] <pmurias> masak: re perl5 interoperability if perl5 is not made stackless, smop still will be able to interoperate with it but a call to the perl5 interpreter will create a barrier for continuations

[13:40] <masak> pmurias: what does that mean in practice?

[13:42] *** wknight8111 joined
[13:43] <pmurias> masak: you won't be able to invoke a continuation from within the perl5 code, unless you are prepared to leak memory

[13:44] *** jan__ left
[13:44] <masak> ah, so you won't be able to (1) create a continuation in the p6 world, (2) pass it to the p5 world, and then (3) invoke it there. did I understand you correctly?

[13:45] <pmurias> yes

[13:45] <masak> that's not a problem at this point, since the CPAN modules we're interested in don't depend on that :)

[13:45] <masak> besides, continuations are deliberately unspecced in Perl 6, so right now there's not even a way to create/pass them

[13:46] <masak> unless, of course, an implementation has'em anyway :)
