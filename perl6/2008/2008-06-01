[04:37] <Auzon> Specifically, I want to extract the list of filenames that I modified that contain "[gsoc" in the revision message.

[04:40] <diakopter> I seem to recall someone in #parrot having written a perl module to do just that... it's on the CPAN I think.  I just don't recall its name.

[04:42] <Auzon> I'll look into that. Thanks :)

[05:18] <[particle]> auzon: you can run svn log -r<some_rev>:HEAD --verbose | ack -A 99 \[gsoc | ack \w+/ # or something similar

[05:19] <Auzon> Oh. I could just grab the revision numbers and log each one separately

[05:19] <pugs_svnbot> r20612 | diakopter++ | [yap6] rearranging

[05:19] <Auzon> As it stands, I did a complex string of svn log processed by perl5, xargs

[05:20] <Auzon> The best bet is for me to just keep a count of my test cases. That's all I really need to do.

[05:22] <spinclad> slavik: not sure.  it's been broken for 6.6 for a while.   i've just lately upgraded to 6.8, so i'll be trying soon.

[05:23] <slavik> spinclad: ty

[05:23] <slavik> spinclad: I tried to build with 6.8 on ubuntu hardy and it fails for me

[05:23] <slavik> give an error about Bool and says to report a bug

[05:24] <spinclad> now that 6.8 is in lenny, i'm ready to give it a go again

[05:24] <[particle]> auzon: i think we could take bits of t/spec/fudge and run them on an svn diff of all your commits from start date of gsoc to get a count of tests, even broken down by file

[05:25] <spinclad> so 6.8 claims a bug in itself?

[05:25] <slavik> spinclad: I can try to build right now and give the exact message if you like

[05:26] <Auzon> [particle]: Interesting. The only problem is excluding my "reorganized file" count from the "added tests" count. SVN thinks these are the same since moving and adding both give the same log entry. :-/

[05:26] <spinclad> slavik: i'll be off to bed soon (within 20 minutes); i can work with you till then.

[05:26] <[particle]> you can every test addition and deletion, and determine the net

[05:27] <[particle]> t/foo/bar.t 67 deleted ; t/spec/S02-foo/bar.t 53 added ; t/spec/S03-baz/quux.t 14 added

[05:27] <[particle]> etc

[05:27] <Auzon> Makes sense :)

[05:28] <Auzon> Yeah, I'd be willing to look into that

[05:28] <[particle]> let's point moritz at the log if you don't have the time

[07:36] <bacek__> rindolf, testing rakudo

[07:36] <rindolf> bacek__: ah, nice.

[07:36] <rindolf> bacek__: do all tests pass?

[07:36] <rindolf> bacek__: I went biking yesterday.

[07:36] <rindolf> It was a Sat so: 1. Less cars. 2. More people, including more babes.

[07:37] <rindolf> There's "babes", there's "foxen", there's "hotties", there's "hot chicks".

[07:38] <rindolf> According to wikiquote "chick" also usually imply attractive.

[10:11] <masak> should be possible to get statement modifier 'for' to work when block 'for' apparently generates correct PAST...

[11:18] <nothingmuch> some B crack, too

[11:18] <rindolf> nothingmuch: I'll probably going to abandon the Moosification of Test-Run.

[11:18] <rindolf> Because it made it much slower.

[11:18] <rindolf> nothingmuch: B crack?

[11:18] <nothingmuch> various B/B::Generate hackery

[11:18] <rindolf> nothingmuch: do you follow the use.perl.org feed?

[11:18] <nothingmuch> no, i don't

[11:18] <rindolf> nothingmuch: ah, cool.

[11:19] <rindolf> nothingmuch: ah, it's very interesting.

[11:19] <rindolf> And not too much high volume.

[11:19] <nothingmuch> i find use.perl.org utterly unusable

[11:19] <rindolf> nothingmuch: and some kinda-interesting off-topic stuff.

[11:19] <rindolf> Like chromatic's rants about Perl FUD.

[11:19] <rindolf> nothingmuch: I'm starting an alternative soon.

[11:19] <rindolf> perl-speak.org

[11:19] <rindolf> Already started playing with Drupal.

[11:20] <nothingmuch> and looking at the front page none of the items are really what I'm interested in

[11:20] <nothingmuch> ++ on that

[11:20] <nothingmuch> though maybe drupal will be a little hard to sell to people

[11:21] <rindolf> nothingmuch: I'm talking about the blogs list.

[11:21] <rindolf> nothingmuch: why would it be?

[11:21] <rindolf> nothingmuch: because it's PHP?

[11:21] <nothingmuch> yep

[11:24] <rindolf> nothingmuch: I discuss it there.

[11:24] <rindolf> But many Perl wikis use MediaWiki.

[11:25] <nothingmuch> i'm just saying some people are liable to complain

[11:25] <nothingmuch> personally I don't think it's an issue

[11:25] <nothingmuch> but maybe for political reasons you should investigate e.g. bricolage

[11:26] <rindolf> nothingmuch: Bricolage will be a mess to setup.

[11:26] <rindolf> It requires Apache 1.3.x with mod_perl compiled in.

[11:26] <rindolf> And lots of CPAN modules.

[11:26] <rindolf> nothingmuch: it should be very powerful.

[11:27] <nothingmuch> i'm not contesting that drupal is good software

[11:27] <rindolf> nothingmuch: Drupal is much easier to setup.

[11:27] <nothingmuch> or easier to setup

[11:28] <nothingmuch> i'm saying that some people can't see beyond the fact that it's written in PHP

[11:28] <rindolf> nothingmuch: I know.

[11:28] <rindolf> nothingmuch: well, it's their loss.

[11:28] <nothingmuch> esp. in the context of something that is supposed to be a perl community gateway you will probably find lots of resistence

[11:28] <rindolf> nothingmuch: some Python-ILers had an issue with MediaWiki too.

[11:29] <rindolf> nothingmuch: but what can I do?

[11:29] <nothingmuch> either try hard for a perl based solution, or let it be

[13:57] <rindolf> nothingmuch: how many modules do you have on CPAN?

[13:57] <rindolf> I mean distros.

[14:13] <nothingmuch> rindolf: i dunno, maybe 80 or so

[14:13] <rindolf> nothingmuch: wow.

[14:13] <nothingmuch> but some I uploaded and they aren't really mine, and some others have done the same

[14:13] <rindolf> nothingmuch: a lot

[14:13] <rindolf> I think I have about 50.

[14:13] <rindolf> nothingmuch: ah.

[14:13] <nothingmuch> 50 is also quite a bit

[14:14] <rindolf> I now have a Freecell (hi Muli!) related module.

[14:14] <rindolf> Well, I didn't upload it yet.

[14:14] <rindolf> It's not a solver - that would be too slow in Perl 5, but it's a verifier for solutions.

[14:14] <rindolf> Which I need for Freecell Solver.

[14:17] <nothingmuch> are there any practical applications for freecell solvers, btw?

[14:17] *** rindolf is now known as Rindotje

[14:18] <Rindotje> nothingmuch: yes.

[14:18] <Rindotje> nothingmuch: they are used in research.

[14:18] <Rindotje> nothingmuch: and by people who want to see if a certain position is solvable.

[14:18] <Rindotje> nothingmuch: well, they're not going to cure AIDS.

[14:19] <nothingmuch> uh, i mean what is the merit of finding out if a position is solvable

[14:19] <Rindotje> nothingmuch: if you can construct a Polynomial time Freecell solver then you'll solve the P-NP problem.

[14:19] <Rindotje> nothingmuch: so you'll know if you've reached a dead end.

[14:19] <Rindotje> And run-time solutions where the computer plays it by himself are really cool.

[14:19] <Rindotje> You press "play" and watch the machine do the thinking.

[16:29] <TimToady> pmichaud: Item() is identical to $() or item(), so it's really just the old scalar context.  It would generally be redundant on scalar parameters.  It might not even be a real type.

[18:33] <Auzon> hm. That should be fairly easy to write in Perl 6.

[18:34] <moritz_> problem is that that it mutates an Undef to an Int

[19:02] <pmurias> @tell mncharity the js object model is not natural for supporting the p6 oo model, as it's primitive and inflexible (it was the simplest way of implementing oo)

[19:10] <moritz_> Auzon: I backlogged now... I think you could rewrite http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/misc/svn-search/cgi/search.pl as a CLI tool

[19:12] *** dominiko left
[19:12] <moritz_> Auzon: I thought a bit about rakudo's "make realclean" problem... maybe we could add a command to exp_evalbot that takes care of this...

[19:13] <moritz_> so you could say "rakudo clean" or something, and then exp_evalbot writes a temporary file...

[19:13] <Auzon> We also check if Makefile.in changed.

[19:13] <Auzon> (I think it's Makefile.in. Going from memory here.)

[19:14] <moritz_> and the cronjob that rebuilds rakudo check for that file, and if it exists 1) deletes it 2) make realclean; 3) perl Makefile.PL (in toplevel parrot dir) 4) make (in rakudo dir)

[19:14] <moritz_> Auzon: probably config/makefiles/*.in

[19:15] <moritz_> well, that would be the better alternative

[19:15] <moritz_> because it involves no user interaction

[19:15] <moritz_> which is safer and saner

[19:15] <Auzon> regarding rewriting your svn search thing as a CLI: That'd be pretty easy, especially if I used HTML::Template to output text/XML/JSON/YAML/whatever.

[19:15] <Auzon> I'll take a look at both of those issues shortly...

[19:15] <moritz_> only drawback is that you'll have to keep a kinosearch index locally

[19:16] <moritz_> (and install KinoSearch with all its dependencies :/ )

[19:28] <pmichaud> (realclean)  I'd recommend doing realclean when any of the following files changes

[19:28] <pmichaud> config/gen/makefiles/*.in     # from parrot root

[19:28] <pmichaud> languages/perl6/config/makefiles/root.in

[19:28] <pmichaud> MANIFEST

[19:29] <pmichaud> I think that would catch nearly all of the cases where a realclean is required.
