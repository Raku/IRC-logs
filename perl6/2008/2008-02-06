[00:22] <ruoso> night &

[00:23] <cj> wolverian: strange... what all do I need to set to get irssi to play nice with utf-8 chars?  do you know?  Setting gnome-terminal's encoding to utf-8 is obviously not enough...

[00:24] <wolverian> cj, it's easiest if your locale is utf8, then everything (including screen and irssi) work automatically. the manual method is doing /set term_charset utf8 and setting screen to utf8 with ^A :utf8

[00:24] <wolverian> cj, (but setting the locale requires restarting irssi and screen)

[00:28] <Juerd> I've found it necessary to set the locale and restart screen.

[00:28] <Juerd> ^A:utf8, -U, etc, never worked well for me.

[00:29] <wolverian> I haven't actually tried the manual method for some years, since I haven't needed to.

[00:29] <wolverian> so you might be right in that it doesn't even work.

[00:29] <wolverian> of course since you can set the locale per-program, it doesn't make much sense even to do that :)

[00:29] <wolverian> $ LANG=foo.utf8 screen irssi 

[00:30] <wolverian> but really.. are there any modern distros that ship with non-utf8 locales by default?

[03:19] <mncharity> TimToady: re Why am I reinventing cheat/metholate?, hmm... my impression is c/m basically transforms STD into code which can be run on a pugs-level p6 implementation.

[03:19] *** justatheory left
[03:21] <mncharity> STD_extract has the (still work in progress) objective of providing enough information to "hand" implement a p6 parser when you don't have p6, and only a partial regex engine.  So it tries / will try to answer questions like

[03:23] <mncharity> what do all the code blocks (which need to be translated to p5/ruby/whatever) look like.  what are all the rx pattern features used.  what are all the subrules used.

[03:24] <mncharity> what are all the instances of mumble, so I can metaprogram draft code (ast nodes, or whatever) for them.
