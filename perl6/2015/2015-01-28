[01:39] <muraiki_> does anyone know if there are any efforts to make subset constraints checked at compile type? I guess that'd essentially be on the way to implementing dependent types, so I imagine that answer is no :)

[01:42] <masak> muraiki_: no.

[01:43] <masak> muraiki_: but I don't really see any reason some "safe" subset (pun not intended) of subset constraints couldn't be checked at compile time, as a friendly bonus on the part of the compiler.

[01:43] <masak> the only thing that it has to be careful about is that the subset check terminates. which can be checked in a fair number of cases without angering the Halting Problem Beast.

[01:44] <masak> ...but (a) it's not done yet, and (b) who knows whether it will be

[01:44] <muraiki_> masak: thanks!

[01:45] <masak> same thing with enforcing return types. *theoretically*, Perl 6 could warn and say "you're clearly returning a Str here, but you declared you'd return an Int. that'll never work, and so I'm telling you now instead of letting you find out at runtime."

[01:45] <masak> ...but it's not done yet.

[01:45] <masak> I consider those things optional compile-time bonuses on which you should not depend (because they'd likely be implementation-dependent) but which will ultimately save you time because you don't have to rebuild your whole project.

[01:47] <vendethiel> masak: I think the return type one will come a long time before liquid types ;-)

[01:50] <Peter_R> I wish I knew what half the stuff talked about here meant

[01:52] <vendethiel> masak: makes me think about CL's optional types

[01:52] <vendethiel> it's not required in the specs that compiler do it, but most of them will do it anyways

[01:52] <masak> Peter_R: just so you know, I was once in your current place.

[01:53] <masak> Peter_R: it gets better, fast, to the extent you curiously explore the terrain.

[01:53] <masak> Peter_R: half of the confusion is just language barrier. we're pretty specific in our terminology and lingo.

[01:54] <Peter_R> I'm not a complete stranger to compilers and such, but certainly no expert

[01:54] <masak> I remember looking at the backlog of pmurias and ruoso the way a deer looks at approaching car headlights.

[01:54] <masak> that must be many years ago now.

[01:54] <Peter_R> All very interesting to hear anyway :)

[01:55] <masak> when in doubt, ask people to show you stuff on camelia. you'd be surprised how concrete some things can be made ;)

[01:55] <Peter_R> Will do, thanks for the encouragement

[02:05] <masak> curiosity*

[02:05] <vendethiel> masak: would allow to check for "where"s at compile time -- see liquid haskell

[02:06] <vendethiel> that's what I'm interested in in the very very very long term :)

[02:07] *** fwilson left
[02:07] <masak> vendethiel: lately I've been hearing like a refrain in my head, but it's still hard to verbalize. something like, if you do TDD and eschew side effects to some degree, your editor/IDE should be able to run circles around your typing, helping you in all manner of ways by abstractly interpreting the code you're writing.

[02:07] <masak> not sure if that makes sense.

[02:07] <vendethiel> it does to every haskell/idris/...-er out there :-)

[02:08] *** fwilson joined
[02:08] <masak> but let's say you start by writing a test case. an input and an expected output. now the IDE knows what you should have once you're done/happy.

[02:08] <masak> then do that for a couple of tests.

[02:08] <vendethiel> masak: you should try agda or idris, often enough, the compiler can generate implementation for the function :P

[02:08] <masak> ideally, you could get feedback for all the tests at each *keypress* you do in the editor. just nicely tabulated next to your code.

[02:09] <vendethiel> with data Bool = True | False then a "not" function with Bool -> w/e, the ide-slave will generate different implems. for each constructor in the type

[02:09] <masak> vendethiel: I will. thanks for the tip. I sometimes skim some agda/idris docs just to make sure I have a clue what they're about.

[02:09] <vendethiel> (ctrl-c ctrl-l iirc for agda2-mode emacs)

[02:10] <vendethiel> I call that "try by autocompletition" :P. I just type w/e, and try to complete until the compiler finds stuff to put in holes

[09:00] <brrt> oh

[09:00] <brrt> that's what you said

[09:00] <Kristien> or do I have to put \s* before all of my rules and tokens?

[09:02] <Kristien> or perhaps proto token lexeme { \s* * }

[12:53] <moritz> pmurias: you can call time_n() several times, and test that the results are increasing

[12:54] <jnthn> Please don't write tests that sleep.

[12:56] <pmurias> and the other question is how accurate is time_n supposed to be?

[13:07] <Kristien> vendethiel: :O

[13:07] <Kristien> I think I should write my compiler in Perl 6.

[13:07] <Kristien> Instead of in JavaScript.

[13:08] <vendethiel> "put the javascript down, we can help you"

[13:08] <Kristien> Though I don't think there's an escodegen-like library for Perl 6. :v

[13:08] <Kristien> There is Rhino, though.

[13:09] <pmurias> Kristien: what are you compiling?

[13:09] <vendethiel> pmurias: lasagnas :P

[13:10] <Kristien> language I'm working on

[13:10] <pmurias> any description of that?

[13:11] <Kristien> The language is like Eiffel and Scala and the compiler generates ECMAScript 5 code.

[13:12] <Kristien> Or rather, is to generate ECMAScript 5 code.

[13:13] <pmurias> is it a lightweight layer on javascript like coffescript or something more removed like nqp-js/rakudo-js?

[13:13] <vendethiel> less lightweight

[13:13] <vendethiel> it changes semantics, big time

[13:14] <Kristien> Much less lightweight.

[13:14] <Kristien> and much more strict

[13:15] <pmurias> is the code/description somewhere?

[13:15] <Kristien> vaguely: https://github.com/rightfold/lasagnascript

[13:15] <Kristien> but the compiler is junk currently; I'm rewriting it asap

[13:19] *** kjs_ left
[13:22] <Kristien> I want to use an SSA intermediate representation since that's much more flexible than directly converting the AST to an ECMAScript AST

[13:26] <pmurias> in nqp-js I'm using a "chunks" abstraction, Chunk.new($type, $sideeffect_free_js_expression, @array_of_js_statements_as_strings_or_chunks_needed_to_make_expression_valid)

[13:26] <Kristien> and I want to focus less on ES interop and more on sanity

[13:26] <Kristien> pmurias: my current compiler has two functions: one to generate statmeents and one to generate an expression

[13:26] <Kristien> which one is used depends on context

[13:27] <Kristien> if something can only be compiled to a statement and an expression is expected, it's put in an IIFE

[13:27] <Kristien> (e.g. throw and switch)

[13:27] <pmurias> IIFE?

[13:27] <Kristien> immiediately-invoked function expression

[13:27] <Kristien> you can use that to turn statements into expressions

[13:27] <vendethiel> *sometimes*

[13:27] *** yqt joined
[13:27] <Kristien> You can't do it for return statements obviously.

[13:27] <vendethiel> that'll work with throw (somehow), but will completly fail with break/return

[13:28] <vendethiel> and also, generators

[13:28] <Kristien> Good thing LasagnaScript has neither return statements nor generators.

[13:28] <vendethiel> well, compiling with "yield* IIFE" *should* work

[13:30] <Kristien> I've never written a return statement in Perl :P

[13:30] <pmurias> re sanity vs transprency, IMHO not having fully transparent interop is a serious barrier

[13:32] <Kristien> I still have to design the whole interop stuff

[13:34] <pmurias> we won't be able to have fully transparent interop in nqp-js/rakudo-js to the degree coffescript because the language is too far removed from javascript

[13:35] <Kristien> how does nqp-js do stuff like Int?

[13:35] <pmurias> what do you mean by that?

[13:35] <Kristien> well rather, uint32

[13:36] <Kristien> e.g. integer arithmetic and overflow stuff

[13:36] <Kristien> JS has only floats so you have to use bitwise operations on integers

[13:36] <pmurias> that's what I use

[13:36] <Kristien> nice

[13:37] <pmurias> I currently have int32 only

[13:37] <pmurias> nqp doesn't expose uint32

[16:53] <tadzik> hmm. If I do 'my $b = 5', $b is a Scalar. How do I get to that Scalar?

[16:54] <raydiak> is that what VAR does?

[16:54] <raydiak> m: my $b = 5; say $b.VAR

[17:17] <raydiak> so last night I wrote a crude PNG output module in < 100 lines...while I'd like to extend it to be full-featured, it's easlily possible that it will be superseded by someones libpng wrapper or something before that happens

[17:17] <raydiak> what to name it?

[17:17] *** fhelmberger left
[17:20] *** FROGGS left
[17:21] <japhb> Have we gotten a ::PP naming convention in the Perl 6 world yet?

[17:21] <raydiak> not that I've noticed, but it occured to me

[17:21] <japhb> And is it output only?

[17:22] <raydiak> for now

[17:22] <Kristien> raydiak: call it PN6

[17:22] <japhb> Oh dear.

[17:22] *** lestrrat left
[17:22] <raydiak> heh :)

[17:23] <japhb> Image::PNG::PP?

[17:23] <japhb> or Image::PNG::Writer::PP?

[17:23] <raydiak> it does rely on Compress::Zlib, though

[17:23] <japhb> Maybe just Image::PNG::Writer then

[17:24] <japhb> And let someone else have Image::PNG::libpng

[17:24] <raydiak> admittedly the main goal was to make it portable, though idk to what extent it currently is w/the zlib bits

[17:25] <japhb> I guess the p5 version actually capitalizes the L

[17:25] <japhb> zlib is really, really portable.  Whether our binding to that is as portable is another question.

[17:25] *** Rounin joined
[17:26] <raydiak> and the problem w/the ::Writer is that I may very well extend it for reading too, it's just not there yet...it's like trying to name a kid before s/he has developed a personality :P

[17:27] *** lestrrat joined
[17:28] <raydiak> but taking over "Image::PNG" with some 90-something lines I hacked together in the middle of the night and have a less-than-full commitment to pursuing seems wrong too, of course

[17:28] <japhb> It's not like you can't fork your own project, or make a new one from the bones of the old.

[17:31] <raydiak> true

[17:33] <raydiak> how does Image::PNG::Portable sound? non-commital, but at least conveys the intent

[17:38] <raydiak> hello perl6_newbe

[17:39] *** lestrrat joined
[17:39] <perl6_newbe> I was looking for help to move a file with perl6. But did not find any docu. IO::Path did not provide move. How can I move a file?

[17:39] <jdv79> is there a profiler like NYTProf yet?

[17:40] *** [Sno] left
[17:40] <Mouq> perl6_newbe: Try rename?

[17:41] <raydiak> perl6_newbe: http://design.perl6.org/S32/IO.html might help

[17:42] <Mouq> raydiak: It looks like move() is NYI, however

[17:42] <Mouq> Or .move or whatever

[17:43] <raydiak> ah...then copy and unlink?

[17:43] <raydiak> if rename fails, I mean

[17:43] <jdv79> not automagically if that's what you mean

[17:44] <jdv79> rename/move is atomic

[17:44] <raydiak> no, I meant as a workaround

[17:44] <Mouq> m: nqp::move

[17:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 358d1d: OUTPUT«===SORRY!===␤No registered operation handler for 'move'␤»

[17:45] <perl6_newbe> OK thx. I want to move the file to a new location, so renaming is not what I want

[17:45] <jdv79> that's one peeve i have with File::Copy::move in p5 land - it just falls back without option iirc

[17:45] <perl6_newbe> Try copy and unlink

[17:45] <japhb> jdv79: Moar has a profiler.  It's not as good as NYTProf yet, but it's a decent start.  It's currently a bit hobbled by the design of list processing in Rakudo ... but that's due to be replaced in the GLR.

[17:45] <raydiak> oh and there is perl6 --profile, which will spit out a pretty html file, but will bring your browser to its knees on large outputs

[17:45] <raydiak> wow I'm like 10 seconds behind everyone today :)

[17:45] <jdv79> so 2 options but nothing great yet

[17:46] <jdv79> i'll have to make a note to test those out soon, thanks.

[17:46] <raydiak> --profile is the one japhb++ was talking about too

[17:47] <raydiak> for moar it does html, under parrot it gives some other format I can't remember...don't think we have jvm profiler at all

[17:48] <japhb> People who teach systems design (jnthn, masak, I'm looking at you two especially): One of my coworkers was asking for good books on system architecture and design.  I have spent more time studying subsystems than overall architecture during this millenium.  What books would you recommend?

[17:53] <Kristien> something from the previous millenium, when things were still sane

[17:54] *** kurahaupo left

[19:45] <jercos> with a unicode keyboard :p

[19:45] <jercos> (it depends on your OS, and sometimes what character you want to type)

[19:46] <bronco_creek> Might not be compatible with my monocode fingers...

[19:48] <raydiak> bronco_creek: atm I'm using IBus, but for most things like «» the compose key (whatever that means in your OS) works fine

[19:48] <jercos> :) I think in most modern DEs you can press control-shift-u, then type the hex codepoint of a unicode character and insert it, for the really weird ones.

[20:38] <pmurias> I use vim too, but adding IDEish Perl6 support to vim won't be fun :/

[20:38] <vendethiel> right, vim is pretty bad at ideslaves :(

[20:38] <pmurias> ideslaves?

[20:47] <vendethiel> pmurias: I think it's about 1) better scripting language 2) running tasks in parallel

[20:50] <masak> pmurias: I'm on vim, mostly out of sheer habit.

[20:50] <masak> pmurias: I do like Emacs, though. I actually prefer it for prose (and vim for code), but sometimes I forget to switch.

[21:01] <jnthn> With a transport strike thrown in for good measure.

[21:01] <FROGGS> hehe

[21:01] <pmurias> jnthn: is there any need to setboolspec with mode 5 (MODE_NOT_TYPE_OBJECT) on NQPRoute and NQPRegex, as it appears to be the default anyway?

[21:02] <pmurias> jnthn: doesn't seem very fun

[21:02] <jnthn> No, it wasn't... Hope to be 

[21:02] <jnthn> argh

[21:02] <jnthn> Did you check if it's done as the default on all backends?

[21:03] <jnthn> If it's consistenly defaulting to that everywhere by now, we can drop them.

[21:10] <Kristien> The only language I can read code in without syntax highlighting is Go.

[21:11] <jnthn> I don't tend to miss syntax highlighting for Perl, 'cus thanks to its rather wide use of chars, different things tend to look rather different :)

[21:11] *** konsolebox left
[21:11] <jnthn> Without coloring them 

[21:12] <xfix> Well, I also program Perl 6 without syntax highlighting, because wrong syntax highlighting is worse than no syntax highlighting.

[21:12] <FROGGS> Notepad++ has syntax highlighting for Perl...

[21:12] <xfix> And Perl 5 is not Perl 6.

[21:12] <jnthn> FROGGS: Yeah, but...what xfix said :)

[21:12] <FROGGS> and Notepad++ is what I use too when I am on windows (and SciTE on linux)

[21:12] <vendethiel> xfix: actually, I prefer a poor syntax hl than none

[21:12] <PerlJam> tchrist used to say that syntax highlighting was often a detriment to the Perl programmer because highlighters often got it wrong  (this was years ago, so maybe highlighters have gotten better since)

[21:13] *** Mso150 joined
[21:13] *** broquaint left
[21:13] <vendethiel> not if it's *completly* wrong, ofc, but perl5 syntax highlighting works fine

[21:13] <FROGGS> jnthn: P5 highlighting is usually perfectly fine... as long as you don't use heredocs I guess

[21:13] *** nyuszika7h joined
[21:13] <vendethiel> yeah, heredocs break lots of hl

[21:13] <xfix> Until you realize that Perl 6 rules are highlighted totally wrongly, and \/ is interpreted as beginning of regex.

[21:13] <jnthn> On Linux, or during my occasional trip to OSX land to debug stuff, I typically use Vim :)

[21:13] <xfix> While you are writting a grammar.

[21:14] <muraiki> for perl5 in Sublime Text, the "ModernPerl" syntax plugin works really nicely, even with variables in heredocs

[21:14] <vendethiel> xfix: I *never* use \ anyways :P

[21:14] <FROGGS> vendethiel: well, / '/' / does not highlight well either :o)

[21:14] <xfix> But that isn't even an issue. My text editor interprets stuff `s` as start of regular expression.

[21:14] <pyrimidine> Inline

[21:15] <vendethiel> no, but {'/'} does

[21:27] <arnsholt> psch: Yup

[21:27] <masak> ok, I'm in a situation where I want to (a) read stuff from a database (a well-placed SELECT), and (b) render some HTML from the results. I don't want to weigh myself down heavily with any frameworks, and besides, I don't think Perl 6 has them yet. any suggestions wrt how to do the query and how to do the HTML templating?

[21:28] <FROGGS> jnthn: do you know if woolfy  and lizmat will already prep the booth? where do we meet?

[21:28] <arnsholt> psch: Because a one-element array and a pointer are basically the same

[21:28] <lizmat> FROGGS: the booth will be prepped on Sat morning

[21:28] <psch> thanks arnsholt++

[21:28] <lizmat> I believe we have access to the building from 8am 

[21:28] <masak> when I think about it, I'm just leaning towards doing the query directly, get an array out, and then somehow .subst some suitable projection of the array into an HTML template.

[21:29] <FROGGS> lizmat: ahh, okay, I'll be there :o)

[21:29] <lizmat> ah, correction: apparently it's officially at 9am that we have access

[21:29] <FROGGS> though, in case Brussels is not extra exciting I might go straight for the hotel and find a place to sit comfortable :D

[21:30] <lizmat> well, the weather is definitely not cooperating for a nice walk around the town

[21:30] <woolfy> FROGGS: officially, buildup of the booth starts at 09:00.  But since we have a lot of boxes to move, I am going to ask if that really is the toime the doors open...

[21:30] <lizmat> we did that today and got completely rained out and blown away at some places

[21:30] <jnthn> Thanks to being ill the last days, I've still a lot to do with preparing my talk.

[21:31] <lizmat> at least the Atomium was dry on the inside

[21:31] <jnthn> So I'll probably be hiding away much of Friday.

[21:31] <muraiki> masak: if you figure out how to do that, I'd be interested in seeing it :)

[21:31] <masak> hm, the spec on `rmdir($path)` is a little skinny. how do I recursively remove a directory in Perl 6?

[21:31] <masak> muraiki: got it. I'll let you know.

[21:32] <FROGGS> masak: also, how to do mkdir -p?

[21:32] <Juerd> masak: system <<rm -rf "$path">>? ;-)

[21:32] <jnthn> masak: Somebody added a Tag module to the ecosystem the other day that may be useful for the generating part.

[21:32] <masak> Juerd: we don't have `system`. we have `shell` and we have `run`.

[21:32] *** telex left
[21:33] <masak> Juerd: but yes, I just did a `shell`.

[21:33] <Juerd> masak: Why shell, not run?

[21:33] <masak> jnthn: I will check it out. but I suspect I will end up not using it, when I can do .subst

[21:33] <masak> Juerd: because I've never really learned the difference :P

[21:34] *** telex joined
[21:34] <masak> Juerd: I think &run is the "safe" one that shell-expands your arguments in a sensible way.

[21:34] <Juerd> masak: shell does sh -c, run takes a list of args and skips shell interpretation.

[21:34] <masak> Juerd: and I don't need that here, since I have a constant string as my command.

[21:35] <Juerd> Roughly, sub shell { run 'sh', '-c', @_ }

[21:35] <Juerd> iirc

[21:35] <Juerd> Or @_[0] even

[21:36] <lizmat> masak: since we have mkpath() specced in newio, I guess I should also spec 'rmpath'

[21:36] <masak> lizmat: we have 'rmdir' spec'd already.

[21:36] *** broquaint joined
[21:37] <vendethiel> masak: Template::Mojo looks good for templating :)

[21:37] <masak> lizmat: but I found no spec about (a) what it does when something goes wrong, or (b) whether it can remove stuff recursively.

[21:37] <lizmat> masak: but that's only 1 level

[21:37] <masak> vendethiel: I'll check it out -- thanks.

[21:37] <lizmat> masak: rmpath() would be the recursive version, I guess

[21:38] <FROGGS> pyrimidine: Inline-C should be fixed now, thank you very much for reporting it :o)

[21:43] <masak> FROGGS: any reason using binding `:=` there is important?

[21:43] <masak> (I got test failures in DBIish while rebootstrapping, though)

[21:43] <FROGGS> masak: so you don't run the .code

[21:44] <masak> oh, it's because NativeCall fails.

[21:44] <timotimo> do we perhaps want to move rakudo.org onto www.p6c.org?

[21:45] <masak> m: class Mojo { has &.code = sub { say "OH HAI" } }; my &main := Mojo.new.code; main()

[21:45] <masak> aha.

[21:45] <FROGGS> masak: I'd seen this: Native call expected object with CPointer representation, but got something else

[21:45] <masak> m: class Mojo { has &.code = sub { say "OH HAI" } }; my &main = Mojo.new.code; main()

[21:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar 166cd3: OUTPUT«OH HAI␤»

[21:46] <masak> FROGGS: seems to work even without the binding ^

[21:46] <masak> FROGGS: yes, that's the NativeCall error I'm getting.

[21:46] <FROGGS> hmmm, perhaps a thinko from my side

[21:46] <masak> pulling and rebuilding worked? I might try that, then.

[21:51] *** lestrrat left
[21:52] <FROGGS> pyrimidine: we just love github, and markdown is their love child... I guess there will be more pod6 when pod6 would look nice on github pages (or in case we'd have a cpan that shows pod6 nicely)

[21:53] <Kristien> I use reStructuredText for everything.

[21:53] * timotimo is testing a patch

[21:53] <pyrimidine> FROGGS: kinda my line of thought as well. now we just need to get a pandoc converter for pod6 <-> markdown :)

[21:54] <FROGGS> pyrimidine: go ahead, I'd use it :o)

[21:54] <masak> pyrimidine: to be honest, pod6 hasn't "clicked" for me yet the way markdown has.

[21:55] <lizmat> hmmm... do we want "move" to be smart enough to recognize a directory as the target, and move it into that directory?

[21:55] <timotimo> FROGGS: can has short test case to get such an error?

[21:55] *** broquaint joined
[21:55] <masak> pyrimidine: markdown just feels natural at this point. I can finish hammering out some markdown in the time it takes for Word to load.

[21:57] <timotimo> god damn it, the network around here is so broken ... in such a strange way, too

[21:57] <pyrimidine> masak: yes, agreed.  We're working on wrapping most of our analysis tools to output MD or MMD, then use pandoc to convert analyses to whatever we need

[22:47] <psch> apparently i need to relearn about references in C :)

[22:48] <Kristien> psch: good thing C has no references

[22:48] <FROGGS> psch: you just need to learn to carefully re-read the docs (or header files) at that point :o)

[22:48] <psch> Kristien: what's the difference between a reference and a pointer?

[22:49] <psch> Kristien: and why does C have a "dereference operator" when it doesn't have references?

[22:50] <FROGGS> m: sub f { nqp::getlexcaller('RETURN')(42) }; sub g { f; say "hi" }; say g

[22:50] <camelia> rakudo-moar 166cd3: OUTPUT«42␤»

[22:50] <psch> FROGGS: yes, that probably would've helped as well.  the concept still isn't firm in my head though, i think

[22:50] <jnthn> You call it a pointer when your program crashes and a reference when it works.

[22:50] <jnthn> That's why Java has references, except when you dereference a null one, and then you get a NullPointerException.

[22:51] <Kristien> It's difficult to explain without examples.

[22:54] <psch> jnthn: sounds kind of arbitrary, if workable.  the reference belongs to an existing something in memory that we can do stuff with, while the pointer is what can contain a reference or something invalid, e.g null or foreign memory

[22:54] <psch> jnthn: is that about right?

[22:56] <Kristien> psch do you know C#?

[22:56] <vendethiel> :P

[22:56] <gfldex> a reference can point beyond the end of the stack if you goto between functions

[22:56] <Kristien> references are like ref and out in C#. pointers are like Object in C#

[22:56] <raydiak> is there a faster way to turn a large Blob into a nativecall CArray than setting the elements one at a time in a for loop?

[22:58] <psch> Kristien: no, i don't know C#

[22:58] <Kristien> :v

[22:58] <gfldex> Kristien: native typed arrays i guess, one of the 3 things on The List Before Christmas

[22:58] <Kristien> what languages do you know?

[22:59] <psch> Kristien: bits of C (...), perl, perl6, some php, a little python, very little asm, java, js

[22:59] <vendethiel> forget about references in php, to start with...

[23:00] <psch> vendethiel: yes, i met the loop behavior

[23:00] <Kristien> PHP has references with &

[23:00] <vendethiel> it's nothing like what C has

[23:00] <vendethiel> php even used to have call-time pass by reference...

[23:00] <Kristien> for example: http://ideone.com/BRa2zn

[23:01] <jnthn> psch: I wasn't being especially serious there. :) But I guess if I was going to make real distinctions, I'd probably say that pointers are all about memory addresses and thus it makes sense to do arithmetic on them, while references refer to a particular thing and deference is the only operation available.

[23:01] <vendethiel> ... which is indeed nothing like what C has :P

[23:01] <Kristien> they're more like aliases

[23:01] <Kristien> or immutable pointers with implicit dereferencing

[23:01] <vendethiel> looks more like C++'s references

[23:02] <Kristien> compare with non-reference: http://ideone.com/Lab4I4

[23:03] <FROGGS> raydiak: you could perhaps try to nativecast your blob to a CArray

[23:04] <Kristien> or: http://ideone.com/BUm8HJ

[23:04] <jnthn> I think we should be able to pass Buf/Blob/native arrays off to NativeCall

[23:06] <raydiak> jnthn: should as in "should work" or should as in NYI?

[23:07] <raydiak> FROGGS++: thanks I'll have to learn about that :)

[23:08] <psch> Kristien: thanks for the example, but i don't really know what i'm supposed to see there

[23:08] <jnthn> raydiak: NYI

[23:08] <Kristien> you can't do that with pointers.

[23:09] <Kristien> In C, void f(int* x) { x = 42; } is a type error. You need to explicitly dereference x.

[23:09] <psch> Kristien: so that means PHP references are binding

[23:09] <psch> and not references

[23:09] <psch> ...?

[23:10] <psch> i mean, maybe i'm hung up on words here, but if it was a reference i have to have to dereference it to get to the value

[23:11] <raydiak> jnthn: I agree, that would make some wrappers easier...right now I'm just trying to compress a few megs, but copying it from a Blob to a CArray in Perl 6 takes over a minute
