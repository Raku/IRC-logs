And I come with an 8 lines script that will allow to easily understand my problem with regex match (either : Cannot assign to a readonly var, or Cannot modify an immutable cursor). I've dropped a gist : https://gist.github.com/emilbarton/7d6671529b0fd6d90423 . Thank you very much for your explanations.

[11:35] <nine> http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse451/10au/tutorials/tutorial_ctags.html

[11:35] <jnthn> nine: You can easily recreate them by copy-pasto'ing a cast, apparenlty... :)

[11:35] <FROGGS> aha

[11:35] <timotimo> it lets you "jump to definition" as well as have a list/tree of symbols for the current file

[12:33] <leont> How can I express "not in between" in a rule?

[12:34] <moritz> there's no good way

[12:35] <leont> I guess I should first define an AND, and then add the NOT, but I'm not sure that's going to work :-s

[12:35] <moritz> especially if you want to scope the "not in between" somehow

[12:35] <leont> Not between "\n| and "..."

[12:36] <leont> ... is a valid plain scalar, except on the main scope where it terminates the document -_-

[12:36] <moritz> <!after\n> <token> <!before $>

[12:37] <moritz> or since it's valid syntax, but different semantics, you could parse it normally, and make the distinction in the actions

[14:17] <lizmat> I have no idea, that was before my time

[14:17] <masak> if it's just a sub, not a keyword, people who wanted .take could already do .&take

[14:17] <masak> but .take is probably older even than that realization...

[14:17] <lizmat> it *is* being used in the core

[14:17] <masak> ok

[14:18] <jnthn> masak: @foo.deepmap(*.take) is cute

[14:18] <jnthn> Though only 1 char cuter than *.&take :)

[14:18] <masak> for some reason, I find it more palatable to stuff the core setting with useful routines than to stuff Mu/Any with useful methods...

[14:18] <masak> I guess because they inherit into *everything*

[14:19] <masak> and we kinda complicate life a little bit for people who felt .take was a nice method name for their API...

[15:22] <[Coke]> RT #126130 - Real.new.say goes to Real.Str -> Real.Bridge -> Real.Num -> Real.Bridge -> Real.Num ... ; is the best thing to do here to add a new() to the Role that just throws an exception? (or is there a reason to allow Real.new in the first place?)

[15:38] <n0tjack> yes, that's what I wanted.

[15:39] *** diana_olhovik_ left
[15:39] <n0tjack> because (1..*) is anonymous, will perl6 reconstruct it on every call?

[15:39] <n0tjack> or does the lazy-list memoization still apply?

[15:40] <TimToady> the 1..* is not expensive to generate, but unrolling the range can be

[15:41] <TimToady> we oughta be able to add and multiply intervals directly though...

[15:42] <n0tjack> how does the compiler know if it needs to calculate all the indices up to the requested interval vs. when it can get away with calculating htem directly?

[15:43] <pmurias> diakopter: I wasn't aware of the controversy

[16:25] <jnthn> Arg passing is one of those things you really want to keep pretty low level...

[16:25] <TimToady> but it breaks our metas

[16:26] <jnthn> Why?

[16:26] <jnthn> I never got why they were written in that way, especially after the single arg rule.

[16:28] <TimToady> sub (+values) { op.(|values) }  # from METAOP_REDUCE_LIST

[16:28] <TimToady> it's already single-arg

[16:29] *** bioexpress left
[16:29] <TimToady> not using | there only works if all possible ops are single arg

[16:30] <jnthn> If the purpose is just to delegate, can it not be sub (|c) { op.(|c) } ?

[17:11] <nine> jnthn: I added a EnumHOW based class called Boolean to BOOTSTRAP.nqp. In Boolean.pm I can ^add_method, but when I try to ^add_multi_method, I get a "Cannot auto-generate a proto method in the setting" error. But when I try to ^add_multi_method the proto manually I get a Redeclaration error during compilation.

[17:11] <nine> jnthn: Any pointers for where should I go from here?

[17:37] <btyler> dha: don't want to do the blogspot login dance, but for me the quality of perl 5's documentation was the omnipresent "SYNOPSIS" section

[17:37] <btyler> was/is, excuse me

[17:38] <dha> no worries. I'll take comments here. ;-)

[17:38] <dha> Thanks.

[17:38] *** pierrot left
[17:38] *** pierrot joined
[17:39] <dha> That would be in module docs, rather than the perl docs per se, yes?

[17:39] <btyler> for me, a decent synopsis makes up for a lot of other failings; heck, I might not even discover the other documentation failings :)

[17:39] <btyler> I suppose, although perldoc -f split has essentially a synopsis in the first 3 lines

[17:40] *** larion left
[17:40] *** n0tjack left
[17:41] <dha> Ah. That kind of synopsis. Noted.

[17:41] <btyler> you're totally correct, I was thinking module, but both are deeply appreciated

[17:41] <btyler> although I think it's fair to say that module docs for modules that ship in the main distribution are almost as important as core language doc

[17:42] <dha> Indeed. but different from the point of view of doc writing.

[17:43] <dha> And, yes, although not labelled "SYNOPSIS" the format examples for functions are important.

[17:43] <btyler> for sure. ok, that's all the input I had, sorry for conflating module doc with core language doc

[17:43] <dha> No worries. It's valuable and appreciated.

[17:43] <btyler> I just have a deep love for SYNOPSIS culture

[17:43] <dha> synopses are good. :-)

[17:43] <btyler> it really helps me get stuff done

[17:44] * Juerd found S07 easy to read, except for Iterable section

[17:45] * Juerd doesn't know what "mark out" means, technically

[17:45] <Juerd> The second paragraph can be read as "mark out when .flat is used", or as "flatten when .flat is used"

[17:46] <Juerd> I'm not sure if "in conjunction with" means "together with", or somehow refers to junctions.

[17:46] <dha> Hm. looking at C<split> in the p6 docs, I'm wondering if maybe we need "synopses" more like the p5 ones, rather than ones that seem to reflect the p6 implementation rather than use.

[17:47] <Juerd> The last sentence ends in "returns identity". I don't know what returning identity is, but which identity is returned?

[17:47] <Juerd> dha: What's a Perl 5 synopsis?

[17:48] <dha> As discussed above. If I understand btyler correctly, stuff like "split /PATTERN/,EXPR,LIMIT"

[17:48] <btyler> I was just shoe-horning the term into a pattern seen in the p5 core docs

[17:48] <Juerd> Oh, synopsis as in =head1 SYNOPSIS, not synopsis as in design document. I get it.

[17:49] *** rurban left
[17:49] <dha> as opposed to what's in split for p6, e.g. "multi sub    split(  Str:D $delimiter, Str:D $input, $limit = Inf, :$all) returns Positional"

[17:49] *** domidumont joined
[17:49] <Juerd> I quite like having the signature in the documentation

[17:49] <dha> Of course, because there are several C<split>s, this gets complicated.

[17:49] <btyler> I'd also note an anti-pattern in the python core docs: I used python for two years in university and pretty much had no idea what the docs meant by "kwargs" everywhere

[17:49] <PerlJam> dha: since types have a more prominent role in P6 and multis exist, I think having the full signature is quite useful

[17:49] <btyler> of course, once you know it, it is very clear

[17:49] <dha> Juerd -  I should have said "along with" rather than "rather than"

[17:49] <Juerd> btyler: Have you found out whether kwargs are edible?

[17:50] <btyler> nom nom nom

[17:50] <PerlJam> dha: that's not to say there shouldn't *also* be here's-how-to-use-the-thing synopses

[17:50] <dha> PerlJam -  right.

[17:51] <btyler> *had no idea what 'kwargs' meant, despite referring to the online docs constantly while working through my assignments

[17:51] <dha> With some exceptions, I'm thinking that more information is generally better.

[17:51] <PerlJam> yep

[17:51] *** AlexDani` joined
[17:51] <Juerd> PerlJam: When examples are included, I love when there's a basic one and a more advanced one. A lot of documentation uses examples to show off capabilities, rather than the simplicity of the most common usage.

[17:51] *** AlexDani` is now known as AlexDaniel

[17:51] <btyler> which generalizes to "be really careful of the amount of language-specific vocabulary you ask people to pick up while reading doc"

[17:51] <Juerd> (Referring to documentation in general, not Perl docs specifically)

[17:52] <PerlJam> Juerd: indeed.  I find it annoying when examples try to show-off everything at once.

[17:52] <Juerd> btyler: Wiki-style links can be useful. They allow you to use jargon for conciseness without the downside of having many people miss out.

[17:53] <AlexDaniel> How can I search for all bug reports that were opened by me? Both open and closed, I want to review a couple of them‚Ä¶

[17:53] <Juerd> PerlJam: I like it when they do, but not as the *only* example :)

[17:53] <dha> Juerd -  I agree. I'm thinking, in general terms, (full signature synopsis)/(usage synopsis)/(description with appropriate examples interleaved)

[17:53] <PerlJam> dha++ sounds awesome

[17:53] <Juerd> dha: That would work. Personally I'm not a big fan of interleaving because it gets messy, but I wouldn't object to it.

[17:54] <btyler> Juerd: yes, certainly, although man page formatting precludes taking too much advantage of links

[17:54] <dha> Well, when I say interleaving, I mean "here's what this does (...) like this: (example)

[17:54] <Juerd> I think that probably most people like the interleaved style.

[17:54] <dha> which might be what you don't like, but I think it's generally useful.

[17:55] <Juerd> btyler: I think that primarily advanced users who have previously studied the language and learned the jargon will use manpages, whereas most beginners will very probably (only) use HTML resources instead.

[17:56] <btyler> yeah, perhaps. I used them a lot when I was learning perl, if only because it was faster than navigating my browser to the appropriate web version, but I guess I don't know how common that learning scenario is

[17:58] <PerlJam> I know that when I must use PHP, php.net is a necessary resource  ;)

[17:58] <dha> Juerd -  I wouldn't assume that. Particularly for p5 programmers who are probably pretty used to using "perldoc perlblah" or "perldoc -f function"

[17:59] <Juerd> I've been called a fossil for using those.

[18:01] <dha> I would not call you that for that. :-)

[18:03] <dha> Of course I would call people who called you that young whippersnappers and tell them to get off my lawn, so maybe I'm a bit out of touch. ;-)

[18:03] * pink_mist prefers reading the perl5 perldocs online most of the time; the browser has a more featureful interface for navigating around the docs than my terminal has

[18:04] <dha> Young whippersnapper. Get off my lawn!

[18:04] <Juerd> :)

[18:05] <dha> Hm. I'm also wondering how something like p5-s "perldoc -f" would work in p6, when there are multiple versions of a function in different classes.

[18:07] <dha> Ouch!

[18:08] <Juerd> pink_mist: I like your nickname. Does it refer to anything specific?

[18:09] <Juerd> Oh, after looking it up and finding the definition in the "urban dictionary" I don't really like it anymore.

[18:09] <dha> btyler -  would it make people's lives easier if I moved to something other than blogger?

[18:09] <Juerd> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pink+mist

[18:09] <pink_mist> Juerd: it's not from ud :/

[18:09] <dha> looking things up in Urban Dictionary is usually a mistake. :-)

[18:09] <pink_mist> Juerd: though I guess it's not far from it ...

[18:09] <Juerd> dha: I didn't specifically look it up there. Duckduckgo found it for me.

[18:09] <dha> btyler -  or mirrored on something other than blogger?

[18:09] <pink_mist> Juerd: heh, not really ... I got it by being uppity towards an operator in some other channel, long long ago, on a network far far away ... and he got annoyed at me and killed me so hard a pink mist was all that was left

[18:10] <Juerd> Heh

[18:10] <dha> Juerd -  even so. :-)

[18:11] <PerlJam> pink_mist: here I've been thinking that you have some affinity for bombs/bomb squads

[18:11] <pink_mist> 0_o lol

[18:11] <Juerd> I thought maybe it had to do with "My Little Pony" or something like that :)

[18:12] <pink_mist> no no, that's just my hostname (uhm, if I'm uncloaked that is) :P

[18:12] <PerlJam> Juerd: that's a far happier version of things :)

[18:13] <btyler> dha: I'm just being a grouch about blog comment systems, don't sweat it

[18:13] <dha> btyler -  will do. :-)

[18:13] <DrForr> Damnit, we're woking on it, it just got delayed due to a failed gravity check.

[18:14] <DrForr> *working

[18:14] <Juerd> Gravity failed?

[18:15] <DrForr> No, I spontaneously decided to make sure gravity still worked by moving a limb wrong.

[18:16] <dha> ow.

[18:17] <dha> But thanks for checking.

[18:17] <DrForr> Hence being hospitalized in Granada for ~2 weeks.

[18:17] <DrForr> You're quite welcome, gotta keep an eye on that bastard.

[18:17] <dha> Oh. I though you did something bad newly. Still sorry to hear about Granada, but glad you have not reinsured.

[18:17] <dha> dammit autocorrect. reinJURED.

[18:18] <DrForr> Oh, that. No, still the original injuries.

[18:18] <dha> Yeah, now that Isaac Newton's dead, we all need to pitch in.

[18:18] *** vendethiel joined
[18:18] <dha> back to original comment, what delay are you referring to?

[18:19] <DrForr> On revamping blogs.perl.org - I saw teh comment on blogger, thought that might be what you're referring to.

[18:21] <dha> oh, no. btyler just had a comment on my last post at dhaperl6.blogspot.com and preferred not to sign in to comment on it.

[18:21] <dha> no mention of blogs.perl.org. UNTIL NOW.

[18:22] <dha> :-)

[18:22] <dha> Although maybe I should mirror there.

[18:25] <dha> Speaking of full signatures... I'm seeing things like "Str:D" and "Str:D:" What are all those Ds and colons doing?

[18:25] <pink_mist> I think it's something to do with 'defined'

[18:25] <pink_mist> but I'm unsure

[18:26] <dha> ok. Now we're both unsure. ;_)

[18:26] <FROGGS> Str:D $foo - specifies a parameter that accepts a Str instance

[18:26] <FROGGS> Str:D: $self - specifies that the method can only be called on a Str instance

[18:27] <dha> and the D means... ?

[18:27] <FROGGS> defined

[18:27] <pink_mist> so what precisely is the difference between 'Str $foo' and 'Str:D $foo'?

[18:27] <pink_mist> ... =)

[18:27] *** mohij joined
[18:27] <FROGGS> Str $foo also accepts an undefined Str, the type object itself

[18:28] <dha> Aha. Ok, now I'm convinced we really need usage synopses (or whatever we would call them) as well as full sig synopses.

[18:28] <pink_mist> what is the ':D' construct in that called? why ':' and why 'D'? well ok, I guess I understand the D

[18:28] *** patrickz left
[18:29] <dha> because anyone coming to p6 for the first time is going to look at that, shake their head, and go away.

[18:29] <FROGGS> pink_mist: a :foo is called a colonpair

[18:29] <FROGGS> pink_mist: we often use these to attach information to things

[18:31] <pink_mist> humm, so the :D colonpair is a predefined one I take it? can one create ones own colonpairs? what colonpairs already exist?

[18:31] <TimToady> it's obviously a smiley

[18:31] <Juerd> :D is probably the ugliest commonly used thing in Perl 6

[18:31] <pink_mist> hehe

[18:32] <TimToady> so it only accepts happy values

[18:32] <Juerd> TimToady: I can't parse it as a smiley because it has no whitespace in front of it :)

[18:32] <dha> Juerd -  I've been around perl long enough that I do not believe that. :-)

[18:33] <Juerd> dha: What other Perl 6 is ugly like it, then? :)

[18:33] <dha> Oh, I have no idea. I just don't think that's anywhere near ugly enough to be a winner. :-)

[18:33] * moritz finds character clsses in reexes too verbose

[18:33] <Juerd> Most of the language is so beautiful. Unlike Perl 5, with its $foo->$#*  :)

[18:33] <moritz> <[a..z]> vs. [a-z]

[18:34] <Juerd> moritz: That was my #1 ugly thing until :D came along, because :D is used much more often

[18:34] * PerlJam has never used :D except in setting code.

[18:34] <Juerd> I wonder if :D is the ASCII equivalent of ‚ò∫

[18:35] <Juerd> (And if ‚ò∫ is equally valid.)

[18:35] <Juerd> I could so have a sub foo (Str‚ò∫ $bar) { ... }

[18:35] <FROGGS> no :o)

[18:35] <moritz> sometimes I wonder if the :D could be implicit for all methods that access an attribute

[18:35] <Juerd> I can even think of why it had to be :D instead of :)

[18:36] <Juerd> moritz: method:D ;)

[18:36] * FROGGS .oO( metho:D )

[18:36] <Juerd> Haha

[18:37] <Juerd> What's metho‚ò∫, though? :)

[18:37] <pink_mist> what about metho‚òª :P

[18:39] <AlexDaniel> Hm. How can I search for all bug reports that were opened by me? Both open and closed, I want to review a couple of them‚Ä¶

[18:40] <Juerd> dha: Scrolling through my Perl 5 code, I think I would use :D a lot in Perl 6.

[18:40] <dha> Oh? How so?

[18:40] <Juerd> I have quite a lot of "defined" checks, including "// die".

[18:41] <Juerd> And then there's a lot of code that probably should have those checks, but doesn't have them.

[18:41] <AlexDaniel> yes, because :D is not there

[18:41] *** pnu joined
[18:41] <AlexDaniel> Juerd: I agree

[18:41] <dha> Ah. you'd do that rather than doing something like "is defined"? Of course, I'm not actually using my brain at the moment, so that may be complete garbage.

[18:41] <mr_ron> is the no-such-rule problem a bug?

[18:42] <Juerd> dha: I like how  :D is very short. I just don't like the way it looks. I have no suggestion for changing it.

[18:54] <jnthn> .tell nine: A proto should be added with add_method since it's not a multi, but a proto :)

[18:54] <yoleaux> jnthn: What kind of a name is "nine:"?!

[18:54] <PerlJam> heh

[18:54] <AlexDaniel> [Coke]: nope

[18:54] <PerlJam> yoleaux: you really should be smarter about this sort of thing

[18:54] <dha> I think I like this definition/usage/description and example template for the docs.

[18:55] <dha> Now I just have to get everyone to buy in...

[18:55] <ilmari> yoleaux: the one between eight and ten, obviously

[18:55] <[Coke]> AlexDaniel: I go to rt.perl.org -> tickets -> simple search -> requestor email = .... -> add these terms and search.

[18:55] <[Coke]> You have a chance to remove the default search criteria, which for me basically "perl6 queue, only open tickets"

[18:56] <jnthn> mr_ron: Your no-such-method() example doesn't call a method, it calls a sub.

[19:18] <mr_ron> From http://design.perl6.org/S05.html#Regex_Routines%2C_Named_and_Anonymous reads: The analogy between sub and regex extends much further. Just as you can have anonymous subs and named subs... ...so too you can have anonymous regexes and named regexes (and tokens, and rules):  These keyword-declared regexes are officially of type Method, which is derived from Routine.

[19:18] <nine> I now have an EnumHOW based Boolean class in BOOTSTRAP that ~~ Int

[19:19] <mr_ron> You have to read the fine print.

[22:06] *** lizmat left
[22:06] <timotimo> a big performance penalty in my code arises from the way i grab neighbouring fields in my 2d array

[22:06] *** lizmat_ is now known as lizmat

[22:07] <timotimo> i just index into values located "outside" the array and catch that with // Inf

[22:07] <timotimo> because .min will make the Inf "disappear"

[22:07] <timotimo> i do not

[22:07] <lizmat> AT-POS instead of [] ?

[22:07] <timotimo> no

[22:07] <lizmat> you could try that

[22:07] <timotimo> i write it like that because it looks a bit less bleh :)

[22:07] <timotimo> the problem really is that it throws the exception and i resolve it with //

[22:08] <timotimo> at least it causes deoptimizations

[22:11] <lizmat> timotimo: in the past (long, long ago, when writing a dungeon game) I resolved this by actually having out of bounds elements with a value

[22:11] <lizmat> that would indicate border in a dispatch table

[22:11] <timotimo> yes, that's a very common way to do this kind of thing

[22:11] <timotimo> add 2 to each dimension and index with 1

[22:11] <timotimo> er, i mean: starting with 1

[22:11] <lizmat> yup, something like that

[22:12] <timotimo> the worst thing for this program is that it leaks something that is tracked by the garbage collector and ends up with a gen2 root put in place for it

[22:12] <timotimo> the garbage collection time rises steadily

[22:15] <timotimo> gnite lizmat 

[22:16] <timotimo> can i just say

[22:16] <timotimo> i'm *so* glad the whole reify crap is gone

[22:17] *** cognominal left
[22:19] <TimToady> no, you can't just say that

[22:19] <timotimo> #perl6 is a free country

[22:19] <timotimo> you can't tell me what i can or can't tell you!

[22:19] <TimToady> you can't *just* say that, obviously

[22:20] <timotimo> pff, are you making fun of my ability to say more than just one thing?

[22:20] <TimToady> ayup

[22:20] <timotimo> nobody says what i say has to be right, or not funny

[22:21] <TimToady> we don't have anyone named nobody around here

[22:21] <gfldex> ohai!

[22:21] <timotimo> nobody's named that

[22:21] <gfldex> 00:21 [freenode] -!- Nick nobody is already in use

[22:21] <gfldex> o.0

[22:21] <pink_mist> what about anybody?

[22:21] <pink_mist> somebody?

[22:22] <pink_mist> everybody!

[22:47] <flussence> happy (belated) birthday, TimToady! (I've just caught up on 2 days of backlog, finally understand what the "one-arg rule" is now...)

[22:47] <dalek> rakudo/nom: 140f3c9 | TimToady++ | src/Perl6/Grammar.nqp:

[22:47] <dalek> rakudo/nom: don't really need the fake precedence level

[22:47] <dalek> rakudo/nom: 

[22:47] <dalek> rakudo/nom: since left-to-right associativity makes . happen after prefix anyway,

[22:47] <dalek> rakudo/nom: and now we have the tests to prove it.

[23:00] <ShimmerFairy> TimToady: ah, so nqp does the wrong thing, then? (Also, there's no tcuc, but I don't think a cadr/cdar/etc. style collection of casing methods would be a bad thing)

[23:00] <yoleaux> 15:56Z <TimToady> ShimmerFairy: no, tc is by definition only for initial caps; use tcuc if you want to uppercase everything

[23:02] <ShimmerFairy> Also, was that "faking precedence" issue related to rakudo having a fake 'unary' associativity?
