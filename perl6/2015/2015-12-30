[00:00] <mojca> I'm not saying that panda is a perl5 script

[00:00] <cygx> mojca: no, it's about mkpath calling .split on a path object, which tries to open that file

[00:00] <mojca> I'm saying that I see perl5.22 in the list of process names (like I see perl5.12 when I run autoconf)

[00:01] <cygx> kittenlips: the channel backlog contains ample testimony that installing rakudo isn't always painless

[00:01] <kittenlips> cygx: sorry didn't know that

[00:02] <TimToady> and 'several major architectures' would be more accurate than 'many architectures'

[00:02] <kittenlips> Should I change it to "fairly easy to install"?

[00:02] <_nadim> I'd like to split the code of a class in two or three files. no it des not make sense to have different classes or roles,  can one do that without getting a redeclaration of the class error?

[00:03] <TimToady> we just don't like to overpromise

[00:03] <kittenlips> TimToady++

[00:03] <TimToady> it will be very easy for most people on the same beaten track as we are

[00:03] <TimToady> not at all easy for people who stray from that track

[00:04] <RabidGravy> _nadim, no

[00:04] <kittenlips> TimToady: meaning straying from the rakudobrew track?

[00:04] <_nadim> too bad!

[00:04] <cygx> mojca: have you tried the change to panda I proposed earlier?

[00:04] <mojca> you mean adding '~'?

[00:05] <cygx> kittenlips: or trying to make rakudobrew do something it wasn't designed for

[00:05] <cygx> mojca: yes

[00:05] <ShimmerFairy> _nadim: sounds like an interesting thing to extend Perl 6 with in a module, assuming it's possible, though :)

[00:05] *** lichtkind left
[00:07] <_nadim> using roles is pretty easy but it force everything to be public

[00:07] <kittenlips> TimToady cygx OK SX and Quora updated

[00:08] <_nadim> which is kinda the point as roles should be just that extra roles, not somehting that deals with internal details

[00:08] <cygx> kittenlips++

[00:08] <kittenlips> changed as you recommended to "several major architectures" and "fairly straightforward to install"

[00:08] <mojca> cygx: it works better, but not properly

[00:08] <kittenlips> https://www.quora.com/When-is-Perl-6-coming-out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2666428/what-is-the-current-state-of-perl-6/

[00:08] <mojca> the first time it stops with "Found no writable directory into which panda could be installed"

[00:08] <mojca> but the second time it is successful

[00:09] <mojca> the weird thing is that something already creates /Users/me/.perl6/2015.12 even if panda fails

[00:09] <mojca> so it's just the final "panda" dir that fails to be created

[00:10] <mojca> but the patch isn't complete/fully functional

[00:11] <mojca> I find it weird that perl6 doesn't have a shortcut for "try to make this folder unless one already exists"

[00:11] <ShimmerFairy> _nadim: yeah, the only thing advice I can offer is that maybe you can refactor your design into naturally smaller classes, so having more public classes wouldn't actually be an issue.

[00:12] *** ELBeavers_away is now known as ELBeavers

[00:12] <_nadim> There's always the preprocessor if this upsets me too much.

[00:13] *** jshy joined
[00:13] *** Praise left
[00:13] <mojca> if I replace "try mkpath $pandadir unless $pandadir ~~ :d;" with "mkpath ~$pandadir;" then it works the first time

[00:13] <mojca> If I put just "mkpath $pandadir;" then it fails as before

[00:14] <mojca> so probably the second occurence ("unless $pandadir") is also problematic

[00:15] <_nadim> ShimmerFairy: I understand the reason why one wants to have the whole class in a single compilation unit, it's simpler than implement dependencies and "link" stuff together before running

[00:16] *** RabidGravy left
[00:16] <cygx> I think plain mkdir already can create paths and does not fail on existing directories

[00:16] <cygx> we should probably change panda to use that instead of the custom mkpath

[00:17] <_nadim> but something one could have some mechanism that is used at the declaration time of the class that says "Hej, there are other bits of me in these files". like inheritance or mixins do.

[00:17] <bbkr> hi. https://travis-ci.org/bbkr/GeoIPerl6#L1177 - NativeCall forces me to use appropriate numeric type.  which one should I use if *.h file for this library says simply "int" ?

[02:57] <flussence> I think the main reason for S/// is to make certain patterns of «S[foo] = bar» not-impossible... I can't imagine it's necessarily useful everywhere s/// is

[02:57] <AlexDaniel> what is S/// ?

[02:58] <cxreg> "This is because the placeholder variables are sorted in Unicode order. "  <- I gotta say that is highly non-intuitive

[02:59] <cxreg> regarding $^ twigils

[02:59] <ShimmerFairy> AlexDaniel: non-mutating version of s///

[02:59] <flussence> isn't that just $_.sort(*.NFKD) or something?

[02:59] <AlexDaniel> cxreg: I've always thought that they were in order of appearance

[02:59] *** Su-Shee left
[03:00] <cxreg> AlexDaniel: you'd think?  going by lexical sort is baffling.

[03:00] <ShimmerFairy> flussence: I don't really buy "not necessarily useful like s///" as an argument for not allowing "thing" ~~ S/// :)

[03:00] <flussence> and as far as twigils go, they're all ASCII anyway

[03:00] <flussence> <^ * = ?>.sort(*.ord).say

[03:00] <flussence> m: <^ * = ?>.sort(*.ord).say

[03:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 477830: OUTPUT«(42 61 63 94)␤»

[03:00] <ShimmerFairy> cxreg: if your placeholder variables are beginning to get unwieldy, or you generally don't want "in lexicographic order", you should stop using placeholders :)

[03:01] <cxreg> flussence: it's saying that $^bar comes before $^foo as a positional parameter because "b" lt "f"

[03:01] <cxreg> ShimmerFairy: even if i could agree with that it's still a terrible decision

[03:01] <flussence> oh, that's clearer with context

[03:02] <flussence> for some reason my brain made up some imaginary thing where all kinds of twigil-variables were in a list...

[03:02] <ShimmerFairy> cxreg: I disagree. It makes supplying a sort lambda like  { $^b cmp $^a }  (reverse of default sort) really nice, for example :)

[03:03] <AlexDaniel> ShimmerFairy: what about $^a Rcmp $^b ?

[03:03] <cxreg> if that's the intended use then the example on doc.perl6.org should read that way.  it uses "$^second follows $^first" as an exampel

[03:03] <cxreg> which only highlights how awful it is

[03:03] <cxreg> $^a and $^b are possibly intuitive but just about nothing else is

[03:04] <ShimmerFairy> cxreg: as far as I have seen, you pretty much only ever use $^ vars as single-letter variables, where the sorting is a lot less obnoxious than it may appear to be.

[03:04] <cxreg> then the docs should absolutely reflect that

[03:04] <ShimmerFairy> cxreg: at the very least, I've never bothered with _descriptive_ $^ variables :)

[03:04] <cxreg> in fact, it should maybe only *allow* single letter placeholders

[03:04] <AlexDaniel> I've always did descriptive $^ variables

[03:04] <cxreg> but that's possibly going too far?

[03:04] <AlexDaniel> and now it turns out that by pure luck they were in correct order

[03:05] <cxreg> good lord.

[03:05] <cxreg> hate hate hate this "feature".   sorry.

[03:05] <flussence> the example definitely should use $^a and $^b, since that whole part of the language exists to get rid of perl5's magic $a and $b

[03:05] <cxreg> it's the kind of thing that makes the internet rage at perl's "read-only warts"

[03:06] <AlexDaniel> cxreg: I'm with you. Even if there are reasons for it to be this way, this is going to be a pitfall. A pretty common one actually…

[03:06] <ShimmerFairy> it's really meant for cases where you don't want to bother typing -> $a, $b { $b cmp $a }, because otherwise you should really take the time to do the -> ... bit.

[03:06] *** Ben_Goldberg left
[03:06] <cxreg> er, "write-only

[03:06] <AlexDaniel> ShimmerFairy: what's wrong with Rcmp, again?

[03:06] <ShimmerFairy> AlexDaniel: nothing, but as always TIMTOWTDI :)

[03:07] *** Ben_Goldberg joined
[03:07] <cxreg> no perl hacker objects to TIMTOWTDI.  but fixing highly counterintuitive syntax is the whole reason perl 6 exists.

[03:07] <AlexDaniel> ShimmerFairy: fair enough. Either do Rcmp or take the time to do the -> bit…

[03:08] <cxreg> TimToady: ping.  would like your input on tihs.

[03:08] <ShimmerFairy> well, like or not the current behavior is part of Perl 6. There's no way it'll change by this point.

[03:08] <skids> ShimmerFairy: I had another couple thoughts on the whole binary grammar/unpack thing here https://gist.github.com/skids/cfb129509b0849f50deb

[03:08] <flussence> .oO( {"name":"Acme::RCMP",provides:["Moose"]} ) </acronympun>

[03:08] <cxreg> LOL

[03:08] <TimToady> it's for simple things; if you want to get fancy, don't use it, that is all

[03:08] <AlexDaniel> ShimmerFairy: not that we have to keep counter-productive behavior forever.

[03:10] <TimToady> "it can be abused" is not an argument here

[03:10] <AlexDaniel> .oO( notes for perl6critic: start complaining when you see non-single-character $^vars )

[03:10] <cxreg> it's not a matter of abuse, it's a question of "the casual user does it wrong because it's not obvious"

[03:10] <TimToady> the casual user will do all sorts of things wrong anyway

[03:10] <cxreg> oh well.  whatever.  it'll be among the language's more disliked parts, but if you don't care then ok.

[03:10] <ugexe> m: say $^1; 

[03:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar 477830: OUTPUT«one((Any), 1)␤»

[03:11] <TimToady> I think you're projecting :)

[03:11] <cxreg> talk to me in 2 years

[03:11] <flussence> if anyone can come up with a pack/unpack replacement that lets me do the equivalent of a perl5 "w/a" format, but with arbitrary objects instead of "w", I'll be very happy

[03:12] <cxreg> I'm a fairly decent straw man for the influx of users here

[03:12] <ShimmerFairy> It's admittedly unexpected when you use multi-char $^ vars, but in the simple case it's easy to intuit that $^b cmp $^a is comparing the second arg to the first, in my opinion.

[03:12] <flussence> (who'd'a thought I'd actually *need* the w format some day...)

[03:13] <cxreg> anyway, the docs need fixing.  where's the source code for http://doc.perl6.org/ ?

[03:13] <flussence> github.com/perl6/doc :)

[03:13] <ShimmerFairy> skids: seems a bit complicated, but then again my thoughts are more aligned with a separate 'grammar'-like construct than more "diffuse" arrangement of methods on a per-class basis :)

[03:14] <ShimmerFairy> skids: in particular it feels like 'packing' would try to be too many things at once, where I'd prefer to separate those things (e.g. grammar-like matching vs. (de)serialization vs. ...)

[03:16] *** addison left
[03:16] <skids> ShimmerFairy: what I was trying to get at was extracting the common parts shared between classes and rules based around binary structures so the "code" could be shared -- that way the "too many things" can just draw from that common base and do their won things.

[04:28] <yurivish> Seems fine so far. It augments the built-in repl so things like the arrow keys work again, which was appreciated. The tab completion seems a bit hard to work with – I was hoping it would do something like bash, where it lists the possible completions rather than completing with its best guess

[05:31] <gfldex> why is there a difference between .List.flat and .Array.flat?

[05:33] <AlexDaniel> gfldex: could it be associated with this? “Arrays itemize their elements. Itemized are never flattened, even when explicitly flattening the array.”

[05:33] <AlexDaniel> gfldex: from https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=127036

[05:34] <gfldex> looks like it

[05:36] <AlexDaniel> well, such behavior is less than obvious…

[05:37] <gfldex> and it's causing me troubles because I can't tell rakudos pod parser that i would prefer List over Array

[05:38] <gfldex> i don't really understand why it returns arrays in the first place. I doubt anyone wants to change the Pod:: tree.

[08:59] <[Tux]> The returning type of 'p5_is_array' --> int is errornous. You should not return a non NativeCall supported type (like Int inplace of int32), truncating errors can appear with different architectures

[09:29] <masak> hankache: yes, I would say so.

[09:29] <yurivish> hankache: yes, it's normal. sleep calls are never completely, precisely exact – but that one's very close!

[09:30] <masak> hankache: if you want exactness guarantees, you should use a library of some kind.

[09:30] *** dr4ngd left
[09:31] <hankache> masak yurivish i am fine with the current level of preciseness, i just want to able to explain where the difference is coming from.

[09:31] <nine> hankache: sleep in any language or system always only guarantees that processing is stopped for at least the given time, never that it resumes exactly on time out.

[09:32] <yurivish> hankache: here's one page that talks about it. there are many more if you search around. http://tldp.org/HOWTO/IO-Port-Programming-4.html

[09:33] <yurivish> it's not perl-specific, but most languages rely on the operating system for stuff like suspending themselves

[09:45] <lizmat> good *, #perl6!

[09:45] <RabidGravy> marnin

[09:45] <lizmat> does anybody know when doc.perl6.org pages are regenerated ?

[09:46] <lizmat> did an addition to the faq yesterday, and it's still not visible  :-(

[09:46] <masak> good lizmorning!

[09:47] <lizmat> a project for which I didn't have time to finish before 2015.12, was fixing up ArgFiles handling

[09:48] <lizmat> I envisioned generalizing the $*ARGFILES behaviour into a IO::CatPath and IO::CatHandle class

[09:48] <masak> what does "Cat" connote here?

[09:48] <lizmat> so that <foo bar baz>.IO.open would give you a handle that would consider the files "foo" "bar" "baz" as a single file

[09:49] <masak> is it the same kind of "Cat" as the Stringy type?

[09:49] <lizmat> masak: almost

[09:49] <lizmat> so that you could run things like split, comb, words and lines on them

[09:50] <lizmat> I basically finished that yesterday, but now wonder how to go on with this

[09:50] <masak> lizmat: sounds like the Composite design pattern

[09:50] *** lnrdo joined
[09:50] <lizmat> well, we can bikeshed the naming...  :-)

[09:50] <masak> just pointing to possibly interesting prior art

[09:51] *** krunen joined
[09:51] <lizmat>  now, my problem is really, how do I handle this at this point

[09:51] <RabidGravy> lizmat, I think there is a log somewhere of the doc builds, but I think the travis now runs the whole build process so you can see if it is currently failing for some reason

[09:51] <lizmat> if I add it to the core now and make $*ARGFILES use it, it would be adding features to what is essentially 6.c

[09:51] *** _mg_ joined
[09:51] *** _mg_ left
[09:52] *** _mg_ joined
[09:52] <lizmat> which would mean that "use v6.c" could not tell you if you can use <a b c>.IO.open in that way

[09:52] <lizmat> so we would need to move to 6.d now?

[09:53] <lizmat> one way of handling this could be to have "use v6.d" set a local $*PERL to "6.d", which could then be inspected by the IO::Cat... code

[09:53] <lizmat> and fail if it was 6.c instead of 6.d

[09:54] <ShimmerFairy> you could develop it in a separate branch for now, if there's not a clear answer to how to go about it (I'm not quite sure myself) :)

[09:54] *** lnrdo left
[09:55] <lizmat> my experiences with developing stuff in a branch are not good  :-(

[09:56] *** Arrowhead joined
[10:01] <masak> lizmat: I've recently gotten really interested in developing under feature flags rather than in branches. keeping a unified codebase in master. but we don't have anything like that set up for rakudo right now.

[10:02] <[ptc]> masak: what do you mean by feature flags?  I'm intrigued

[10:03] <masak> [ptc]: in its simplest form, `if %build-settings<feature-X-enabled> { ... }`

[10:04] <masak> [ptc]: but there's a lot of interesting patterns around that, too. like running the tests with only your own feature switched on, or with all features switched on.

[10:04] <masak> [ptc]: once something goes into production, you can just strip out all the `if` statements for that feature flag

[10:05] <ShimmerFairy> At first glance, that A) seems like something you want to do with macros, ideally, and B) feels a little... hackish? I'm not sure about a P6-ish version of #ifdef's all over the place :P

[10:05] <masak> it's not #ifdefs

[10:06] <masak> it's the same code base building the same everywhere. the same thing gets generated for everyone.

[10:06] <masak> it's only the settings that differ. people on a stable release run with experimental features off. developers run with them on.

[10:07] <masak> ShimmerFairy: I think you're right that macros might make things slightly more readable. but the basic idea doesn't require macros.

[10:07] <masak> I want to emphasize that I haven't tried feature flags myself. but the Ember.js project seems to use them to great effect.

[10:08] <ShimmerFairy> masak: well, it feels like the same sort of thing codebases do with #ifdefs, at any rate. And somehow I feel the macro-less solution of if %hash<...> { ... } would look really ugly really fast.

[10:09] <RabidGravy> to lizmat's earlier suggestion, maybe a "use feature :6d" rather than just use v6.d ?

[10:09] <[ptc]> it does sound a lot like #ifdefs though...  Wouldn't that cause a lot of code churn at release time when all of the ifs are removed and the code is reformatted around that?

[10:09] <[ptc]> I'm not trying to be negative, just trying to understand how it would be used

[10:09] <masak> see https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/master/packages/ember-metal/lib/features.js

[10:09] <[ptc]> ok, ta

[10:10] <rickbike> Perl 5 has use feature

[10:10] <ShimmerFairy> It's an obvious choice for language versions though, since it'd be the same as -std in g++ . I'm just not sure about using it to bypass our version control's branches :)

[10:10] <masak> [ptc]: I don't know about churn. I imagine it wouldn't be all that bad.

[10:10] <masak> [ptc]: but I'm wondering if some things are "too cross-cutting" to neatly fit under an `if`, or even several.

[10:11] *** icelesstea joined
[10:12] <RabidGravy> or you know, just create a 6d branch and treat nom as "maint"

[10:12] <[ptc]> masak: true.  It could be hard to isolate the new changes cleanly

[10:12] * [ptc] would love to see "nom" renamed to "master"...

[10:14] <nine> lizmat: I think jnthn++ posted his suggestions for handling language versions in a gist or something a couple of weeks back. Do you know where to find it?

[10:15] <masak> nine: https://gist.github.com/jnthn/f3a691016c20f0cc4cfa

[10:18] <_nadim> is there a Unicode geek here that knows why nobody thought about making a complete ASCCI superscript and subscript. There a freaking Xmas tree but not superscript lowercase q. I really wonder what they were high on.

[10:18] <lizmat> ok, from that I get I should just commit to nom and have the release manager worry about including it in a release ?

[10:19] <lizmat> that doesn't feel very sociable...

[10:19] *** pmurias joined
[10:20] *** rickbike left
[10:20] <nine> lizmat: this looks interesting: "Additions to the setting will be made in a "nested" setting. That is, a "use v6.d" will load CORE.d.setting or so. It can use augment and supercede in order to effect changes."

[10:20] <RabidGravy> jnthn's plan seems sound

[10:22] <ShimmerFairy> yes, I like jnthn++'s plan as well :)

[10:23] <[ptc]> agreed, jnthn++'s plan looks well thought out

[10:24] *** espadrine joined
[10:25] <[ptc]> lizmat: the way I read it is that whatever goes into nom gets automatically moved to master, from which releases are cut.  I guess the social aspect is the release manager asking at which point the release should be cut...

[10:25] *** andreoss joined
[10:26] <masak> ok, so "nom" means "dev"

[10:26] <lizmat> I still don't understand when people would need to do "6.d" to get a new feature such as "IO::CatPath"

[10:26] *** pierre-vigier joined
[10:27] <nine> lizmat: I guess when adding the feature to 6.c would break some test in the 6.c test suite.

[10:27] <lizmat> ah, but that's just it: it wouldn't break any tests in 6.c

[10:27] <RabidGravy> if you're building from "nom" then you're not getting what might strictly called 6.c

[10:27] <lizmat> RabidGravy: exactly

[10:27] <nine> Or maybe even "would it break one of the chosen modules in the 6.c snapshots"

[10:28] <RabidGravy> but "production" isn't going to do that right? (chortles into his imaginary beer)

[10:28] <[ptc]> but then if you're building from master you're also not strictly getting 6.c ...

[10:28] *** iH2O left
[10:28] <stmuk> In 2016, Diwali is on October 30.

[10:28] <RabidGravy> but there is a 6.c release

[10:29] <lizmat> all releases until 6.d will be 6.c

[10:29] <lizmat> but if there are new features added in nom / master, then "use 6.c" becomes ambiguous

[10:29] <[ptc]> ah, ok

[10:31] <ShimmerFairy> lizmat: the ambiguity might be covered in part by 6.d.PREVIEW . And as stated I feel like it wouldn't be a problem to have a g++ -std style usage of 'use v6.c', 'use v6.d', etc.

[11:21] <Floyd-ATC> but coming from p5 that's confusing as hell

[11:22] <nine> [Tux]: no one has ever promised a "6.0.0". Some people seem to have assumed, that the release would be called so.

[11:40] <RabidGravy> lizmat, nine, except if they were actually expecting to really load Int from a module

[11:41] <RabidGravy> what nine said

[11:41] <lizmat> nine: well, having a bare module load (without auth / version) with the same name as a built in class, would be a bad idea anyway, no ?

[11:43] <jeteve> I've tried 'has $.bla = ->{ do and return stuff }();'

[11:44] <jeteve> but that seems to be evaluated ASAP

[11:45] <llfourn> jeteve: I don't know but I seem to remember that it "should be in a module" as some conclusion

[11:45] <nine> lizmat: it would. Yet I'm still nervous about removing module loading related features :/ The past few weeks have tought me that.

[11:45] <llfourn> jeteve: the metamodel is quite flexible so the idea is that someone is going to implement lazy attrs in a module

[11:48] <llfourn> jeteve: there could be two approaches one where they only work if you use $.attr rather than $!attr (you mess with ClassHOW)

[11:48] <llfourn> jeteve: the other you mess with Attribute itself, in particular Attribute.get_value

[11:49] <jeteve> #2 would probably be cleaner

[11:50] <llfourn> jeteve: http://docs.perl6.org/type/Attribute#method_get_value (you will have to override it with a trait, is trait is rw below that for example)

[11:50] <jeteve> cause it keeps the lazyness orthogonal to the other concepts

[11:56] <Arrowhead> Why can I "perl6 -Ilib foo.pl" but do I have to do PERL6LIB="lib" perl6 for a repl with lib available?

[11:57] <stmuk_> I just ran "make html" in the doc repo successdully on my own system with 2015-12

[11:57] <stmuk_> http://doc.perl6.org/build-log/build-2015-12-30T11:55+0000.log

[11:58] <stmuk_> that suggests to me that hack is running an old rakudo for the doc processes

[11:58] *** rickbike left
[11:58] <hankache> normally race would be faster than hyper?

[11:59] <hankache> since it doesn't preserve the order so less overhead?

[11:59] <stmuk_> maybe the "dog food" processes should use 2015-12 

[12:00] <stmuk_> m: use experimental :pack;

[12:00] <camelia> rakudo-moar 477830: ( no output )

[12:01] <RabidGravy> I thought the "cannot unbox type object" in panda installdeps was fix0rificated

[12:01] <RabidGravy> or did I dream that?

[12:02] <lizmat> hankache: only if there is something to race with, otherwise you're just creating overhead

[12:02] <lizmat> try adding a 'sleep rand' in your code to be raced, and see the result then

[12:03] <lizmat> CPU will be more, wallclock should be less

[12:04] * RabidGravy wonders if flattening the dependencies of the dependencies will help

[12:10] <RabidGravy> Arrowhead, it does work, what do you mean?

[12:10] <RabidGravy> m: use NativeCall;  say nativesizeof(CArray)

[12:10] <camelia> rakudo-moar 477830: OUTPUT«8␤»

[12:10] *** TEttinger left
[12:11] <RabidGravy> which is right as it is a 64bit pointer

[12:12] <RabidGravy> you can't know the number of elements in the CArray in the same way as you can't in C, it just doesn't have that information

[12:12] *** ccakes left
[12:12] <Arrowhead> ouch.

[12:13] <RabidGravy> almost any C API will require the array and the number of elements, unless they special case some value like say strings do

[12:14] <Arrowhead> yes, I'm using an api like that. And I'd hoped I could compute the numbers from the data structures I have...

[12:14] <Arrowhead> but it looks like the structure of my perl6 program will look more and more like C.

[12:14] <RabidGravy> you probably need to abstract it a layer up

[12:16] <RabidGravy> well look at e.g. Audio::Libshout and Audio::Encode::LameMP3 - they pass around either Perl arrays or [CArray, Int] arrays with the details (mostly multis in there)

[12:16] <Arrowhead> thanks. I'll now definitely take a look :-)

[12:17] *** hankache left
[12:17] <RabidGravy> for performance reasons I made the "native values" available to give to things that know about them, but for programmer reasons I also make normal arrays available

[12:18] <RabidGravy> I adjusted all those modules so that they would interoperate on both levels if required

[12:21] <RabidGravy> it seems like a pain in the bum but you'll develop your own internal pattern book for dealing with these things quite quickly

[13:16] <Skarsnik> nop I:python should be fixed

[13:16] <cygx> no, Inline::Python should be fixed to no longer use Int in native sub declarations

[13:17] <[ptc]> no, that's a silly comment.  Installing via panda on my box works, on hack it doesn't.  Odd.

[13:17] <[ptc]> I'll look into it further.  thanks for the help!

[13:18] <RabidGravy> or to get it moving, fix I::Python and in the meantime install the fixed version?

[13:19] <cygx> [ptc]: you need to check that https://github.com/niner/Inline-Python/blob/master/lib/Inline/Python.pm6#L51 and https://github.com/niner/Inline-Python/blob/master/pyhelper.c declarations match and only use valid NativeCall types

[13:47] <yoleaux> 15 Dec 2015 00:19Z <geekosaur> ChristopherBotto: it's write access on /tmp that controls whether unlink of /tmp/foo works. permissions on /tmp/foo's inode are not relevant.

[13:47] *** Arrowhead joined
[13:47] <yoleaux> 15 Dec 2015 00:24Z <geekosaur> ChristopherBotto: GNU rm looks at the permission as a courtesy, more or less. Hard links imply that the directory entry is independent of the inode (file). I am not sure perl6 should be in the business of enforcing anything more than OS permissions.

[13:48] <nine> Skarsnik: what do you mean?

[13:48] <cygx> Zero_Dogg: most core classes are part of the setting and semantically part of an outer lexical scope surrounding your program

[13:48] <cygx> so you get lexical acces to the identifiers without use

[13:48] <RabidGravy> Zero_Dogg, an easy rule of thumb is that if it's on http://doc.perl6.org/type.html it's almost certainly compiled in the setting

[14:02] <araujo> I should be able to access a value from a CArray[String] directly using array indexing? , or do I need some special magic for that?

[14:02] <nine> Or....integrated into Test.pm as test-require function (like test-depends in the META.info)

[14:02] <[ptc]> nine: interesting.  The tests for the doc modules have been using `unless (try require)` since February and it seems noone has noticed that it stopped working!

[14:02] <RabidGravy> if it isn't working for you show us what you are trying

[14:03] <nine> cygx: the user will want to see all other errors. IO errors should only occur if something is really wrong.

[14:03] <araujo> Skarsnik, RabidGravy Ok 

[14:04] <Skarsnik> I should add nativecast to the doc

[14:04] <cygx> nine: but if you check for an optional dependency, you generally want to keep going (after possibly emitting a warning)

[14:04] <Skarsnik> You can do stuff like https://github.com/Skarsnik/perl6-gumbo/blob/master/lib/Gumbo/Parser.pm6#L46

[14:05] <nine> cygx: I mean really majorly wrong. As in "this needs fixing or other things will break, too"

[14:06] <smls> Are Hash lookups thread-safe?

[14:06] <nine> And this require thing is why I really wanted to merge curli before 6.c. Because people will write code that uses this API.

[14:06] <Zero_Dogg> What's the perf difference between moar and jvm? Got some scripts to run on a raspi2, which isn't the fastest thing in the world

[14:06] <cygx> nine: because only one precomp store is active at a time, and you're hosed if you cannot access that?

[14:06] <nine> smls: nope

[14:06] <[ptc]> \o/ the docs pages are building again.  nine++

[14:06] * cygx shuold realy read up on that precomp thing

[14:06] <smls> ok

[14:07] <RabidGravy> Hmm ye olde "Missing serialize REPR function for REPR VMException" is back

[14:07] <Skarsnik> cygx, did you have any idea why replacing some nativecast with the correct Pointer[mystruct] .deref fail sometime?

[14:07] <nine> cygx: it's not only the precomp store. Could be the rest of the repository just as well. And if the rest is affected and you don't notice and install other modules, things could get even worse.

[14:07] <nine> brrt: actually, there may be a JIT or SPESH bug revealed by a panda problem

[14:08] *** Arrowhead left
[14:08] <RabidGravy> Zero_Dogg, moar is I believe faster to load and so on, it also works properly with 2015.12 jvm hasn't quite caught up

[14:08] <Skarsnik> Zero_Dogg, jvm is behind moar in term of feature, for perf I don't really know x)

[14:08] <cygx> Skarsnik: not specifically, but deref has issues with pointer-to-pointers, and nativecall generally assumes that you're dealing with pointers to structs instead of struct itself

[14:08] <Zero_Dogg> RabidGravy, Skarsnik: thanks

[14:08] <cygx> (imo a mistake as that's not how C does it)

[14:09] <nine> brrt: panda has a --force flag. That's just a named Bool on the MAIN routine that gets passed on several levels to CompUnit::Repository::Installation::install. In some cases we get an error about unboxing a native after installing a couple of modules.

[14:09] <RabidGravy> Zero_Dogg, I'm just working on something for the RPi at the moment

[14:09] *** _mg_ joined
[14:09] <nine> brrt: The error occurs in a simple if not $force, where $force is just a Bool type object. That's after the same code ran a couple of times.

[14:10] <Skarsnik> cygx, I mean .deref just call nativecast(ptr, type); but I get binding issue comparing to just calling nativecast the same

[14:10] <RabidGravy> I tend to get the basic thing working on a proper laptop then put it on the RPi to test

[14:10] <yoleaux> gfldex: I'll pass your message to hankache.

[14:11] <Zero_Dogg> RabidGravy: nice. I've got it installed through rakudobrew right now, but it uses quite a bit of time before it actually starts executing the script. Not a problem for this one, but a bit annoying while testing it :)

[14:11] <yoleaux> gfldex: I'll pass your message to hankache.

[14:11] <RabidGravy> Zero_Dogg, there isn't a JIT for ARM at the moment, which has some impact

[14:11] <Skarsnik> feel like a Perl 6 bug or return should be a binding or something?

[14:11] <cygx> Skarsnik: workaround is to cast to pointer-to-uintptr (or size_t), read that, then create a enw pointer

[14:11] <timotimo> "return" reconts unless you return-rw

[14:30] <RabidGravy> fwiw, I think my patch may have unintentionally unearthed a further infelicity in installdeps

[14:30] <timotimo> right. we probably specialize istrue in this case to unbox_i, but without making sure the incoming arg is known to be concrete

[14:30] <timotimo> seems like an easy fix; thanks for the golf!

[14:31] <smls> Can two threads use  chdir($dir);  without affecting each other?

[14:31] <nine> :)

[14:31] <perlpilot> smls: probably not.

[14:32] <timotimo> we have only a fake PWD in perl6

[14:32] <nine> brrt: thanks for asking about JIT bugs. Pushed me into the right direction. JIT and spesh are so stable that I completely forget, that they could interfere :)

[14:52] <araujo> Skarsnik, yeah, sorry, I will, checking something first

[14:52] <RabidGravy> (well one of those isn't actually using NativeCall because I never got round to making silan into a library)

[14:52] <araujo> RabidGravy, oohuh ok :P

[14:53] <smls> timotimo: Also, the specs say that «temp $*CWD;» sould work, but it doesn't because the default $*CWD is immutable.

[14:53] <smls> "Can only use 'temp' on a container"

[14:54] <RabidGravy> I think $*CWD is bound to a Proxy if my memory isn't failing me

[14:54] <smls> As long as you don't mix manual assignm,ent and chdir() though, they work fine... :)

[14:58] <ZoffixW> My 2 cents ^ that should place "first" BEFORE "second" into search paths. Reasoning: 1) it's intuitive for them to end up in the order I specified it in my code. 2) Perl 5's use lib does it that way, so the reverse behavior could trip up Perl 5 converters.

[15:48] <ZoffixW> MadcapJake, running rakudobrew build-panda right this second and install succeeds. I notice rakudobrew build panda also starts doing something but I aborted it. Not sure what that does, but the correct command is build-panda with the hyphen

[15:48] *** Arrowhead joined
[15:49] <RabidGravy> MadcapJake, I think it's something to do with panda bundling those itself

[15:52] <brrt> it looks good to me, but that is not a sufficient criterion :-)

[15:52] <ZoffixW> I think the issue is panda bails out with an error when it detects the already installed module. This Issue in particular is the cause I believe: https://github.com/tadzik/panda/issues/274

[16:40] <ZoffixW> That's a confusing statement :P

[16:40] <MadcapJake> Can you install p6doc with rakudobrew?

[16:40] <ZoffixW> Perl === any('Perl 5', 'Perl 6'); # that's how I see it

[16:40] <llfourn> autarch: if you wanted some fun you could mixin %*LANG<MAIN-actions> and then slurp EVAL the file you are interested in. It will give you a callback everytime use is parsed by the compiler.

[16:40] <llfourn> though that will depend on your definition of fun

[16:40] <autarch> llfourn: heh, that sounds like a lot more work than is needed to prototype what I'm working on

[16:41] <smls> I think I found a bug in IO newline handling:

[16:43] <ZoffixW> autarch, what's it called and where is it? (I'm planning on writing my own dist helper, and I'd love to steal some ideas :P)

[16:43] <autarch> ZoffixW: I haven't pushed anything yet but I'm calling it Dist::Wocky

[16:44] <Skarsnik> hm, what is Dist::Zilla?

[16:47] <autarch> Skarsnik: http://dzil.org/ - basically it's a tool that helps you manage distros by turning a lot of boilerplate junk into config - like generating META.info, generating certain types of distro tests (for example Test::Meta tests), automating the release process, etc.

[16:47] *** _mg_ joined
[16:47] <MadcapJake> ZoffixW: well I thought that Task::Star was finishing correctly (exits with 0) but there there is a "JSON::FASt already installed" error and there is no p6doc in my rakudobrew/bin folder

[16:48] <autarch> as someone who maintains dozens of p5 distros I find it _very_ useful and I'm already getting annoyed trying to write META.info files by hand with p6

[16:48] <Skarsnik> I think mi6 was an attemps at that?

[16:48] <mojca> what does "P6M Merging GLOBAL symbols failed: duplicate definition of symbol Panda" mean?

[16:48] <yoleaux> 16:24Z <[Coke]> mojca: if the problem with perl6 in the shebang is that you can't have a shell script as the shebang command?

[16:48] <sprocket> question about Promises - is it possible to have a Promise that’s executed lazily, so that the computation doesn’t start until it’s await’ed or .result is called?

[16:54] <ZoffixW> *sigh* my New Years bot is annoying me with all problems I'm having that I can't repoduce in a small testcase

[16:54] <mojca> but maybe it's just compiler's fault (too old compiler)

[16:54] <Skarsnik> Su-Shee, what is your need exactly?

[16:54] <ZoffixW> mojca, MadcapJake is having similar issue ATM

[16:54] <Su-Shee> Skarsnik: async http client. 

[16:55] <Skarsnik> Oh

[16:55] <Su-Shee> Skarsnik: at least http client. anything which is en par with HTTP::Tiny or Mojo::UA is perfectly fine however.

[16:55] *** xinming_ joined
[16:55] <lucasb> ZoffixW: newline after "}" ends the statement

[16:55] <Skarsnik> should not be hard to write aside http::ua, there is already all the base stuff

[16:55] <ZoffixW> MadcapJake, mojca and right now I'm running I'm running `panda --force install Task::Star` and it gotten further than before, but I see if it succeeds

[16:56] <Skarsnik> My guess will be to look at http::useragent class code and change for an async arch

[16:56] <ZoffixW> lucasb, thanks. I marked the ticket as rejected.

[16:56] <mojca> so "Merging GLOBAL symbols failed" is basically the same or at least related to https://github.com/tadzik/panda/issues/274?

[16:56] <Su-Shee> Skarsnik: I should probably add that SSL is a must.

[16:57] <Skarsnik> Maybe http::ua should be splitted?

[16:57] <lucasb> ZoffixW: you're fast... but maybe I'm not so certain :)

[16:57] <Su-Shee> ZoffixW: is it really shelling out to curl or is it a libcurl binding?

[17:03] <[Coke]> mojca: I'm pretty sure that's not a portable shebang, but if it works on OS X, awesome. (I just tried it here and got a failure...Unhandled exception: Missing or wrong version of dependency ')

[17:03] <Su-Shee> ZoffixW: how is libuv coming into play with HTTP::UserAgent?! 

[17:03] <Su-Shee> ZoffixW: or are you trying to make me use Node? ;)

[17:03] <RabidGravy> ZoffixW, wasn't it something odd to do with the URI module doing a require in a certain way, I think it was golfed to doing a require in a start

[17:03] <Skarsnik> damn no new commit on https://bitbucket.org/chrisburel/smokegen/branch/clang

[17:04] <Su-Shee> interesting to know. 

[17:04] <Su-Shee> hm. 

[17:04] <llfourn> autarch: it seems that CompUnit::Repository has a .loaded method which stores the names of the modules it's loaded if that excites you

[17:04] <mojca> [Coke], most likely it's not a portable way; env works; for anything else, it might help if perl6 was a binary

[17:04] <ZoffixW> RabidGravy, ah, I must've missed that part of the convo :P

[17:05] <[Coke]> mojca: I just did a fresh install of [email@hidden.address] got a precompiled version, and it's barfing.

[17:05] <RabidGravy> let me find the RT

[17:05] <[Coke]> $ /opt/local/bin/perl6 -e 'say 3'

[17:05] <[Coke]> Unhandled exception: Missing or wrong version of dependency 'gen/moar/stage2/QRegex.nqp' (from 'src/Perl6/Pod.nqp')

[17:05] <[Coke]> Is there a way when installing a macport to say don't use precompiled?

[17:06] <[Coke]> ah, -s

[17:07] <mojca> but it would be *very* helpful to figure out the reason for the error

[17:07] <RabidGravy> a workaround at the time was to  do URI.new() *before* starting any threads

[17:07] <mojca> can you please open a ticket before you loose all details?

[17:08] <mojca> I'm unable to get a precompiled version (the buildbot for my os version is defunct at the moment)

[17:09] *** Actualeyes left
[17:09] *** yqt joined
[17:09] <mojca> anyway, you can still uninstall everything and install again to get the precompiled version

[17:09] <[Coke]> typically that error is because there is a stale nqp version; I had inactive nqps & moarvms still installed.. I tried uninstalling them all, even the inactive ones.

[17:09] <Skarsnik> anyone has though on? https://github.com/perl6/DBIish/issues/44

[17:09] *** Arrowhead left

[17:09] <ZoffixW> RabidGravy, neither this code nor the one below it hang for me now: https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126390#txn-1371906

[17:09] <[Coke]> ... and with that, it works fine, even with binary version.

[17:09] <[Coke]> Is there a way to say that a particular distro needs the old version uninstalled?

[17:09] <RabidGravy> ZoffixW cool

[17:10] <ZoffixW> Tried it on two boxes 32bit (couple-days old perl) and 64bit (freshly squeezed)

[17:10] <[Coke]> also: it's super awesome to have a precompiled version to install on a fresh mac box.

[17:10] <[Coke]> mojca++

[17:11] <ZoffixW> RabidGravy, oh, wait, is it an OSX bug only?

[17:11] <mojca> [Coke], when we switch to a new version, the old one will be removed

[17:11] <mojca> but MacPorts cannot touch anything that's not part of distribution

[17:11] <RabidGravy> ZoffixW, no I could reproduce on Linux

[17:11] <ZoffixW> RabidGravy, never mind, I see your note now

[17:12] <mojca> so if you have your own perl6 installed, MacPorts might end up calling *your* perl6 during installation from source in the worst case

[17:12] <mojca> and it certainly cannot uninstall components that you manually installed

[17:19] <nine> mojca: the global symbol merging problem may be caused by loading a precompiled version of a module, then having a "use lib" somewhere and then loading modules again with this time a non-precompiled version of the earlier module

[17:20] *** sprocket left
[17:22] <mojca> nine, thanks; not that I understand though; when I tried to repeat "panda install Task::Star" today, it finished successfully

[17:23] *** nmp left
[17:23] <mojca> do you have any idea which package could be "guilty" of that error? Is there any way to get more verbose output next time?

[17:24] <mojca> (when I will be able to reproduce the problem)

[17:24] <cygx> is RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG=1 still a thing?

[17:25] <Su-Shee> ZoffixW: well I can tell you that HTTP::UserAgent is .. strange. I'm reading for the first time in a decade for an http client the documentation.

[17:25] <Woodi> mojca: when module is precompiled and then loaded it needs to put/merge itself (eg. global variable) into language so when something is loaded second time there is a conflict :)

[17:26] <diakopter> RabidGravy: are you sure the new force default on panda MAIN doesn't break anything

[17:26] <Woodi> nine: use lib  changes repository ?  but newly loaded module should load (replace) or don't load...

[17:26] <RabidGravy> diakopter, no I'm not sure

[17:26] <[Coke]> mojca: they weren't removed when I upgraded....

[17:27] <RabidGravy> I actually suspect there's something weirder going on

[17:27] <RabidGravy> so feel free to revert

[17:27] <[Coke]> they were just inactivated.

[17:27] <mojca> [Coke], what exactly did you have to manually remove then?

[17:27] <mojca> ah, ok, but inactivation is fine

[17:27] <[Coke]> I may be the only person who installed old versions of nqp or moar, though.

[17:27] <mojca> you don't see those files

[17:27] <[Coke]> I did 'sudo port uninstall [email@hidden.address] , e.g.

[17:28] *** Arrowhead joined
[17:28] *** harrison_ left
[17:28] <mojca> the only problem might be (I'm not sure if that is the case for perl) if moarvm would actually try to use some components from nqp, rakudo or panda

[17:28] <[Coke]> I'm willing to ignore it for now; we should make sure there are no issues when 2016.01 comes out, though.

[17:28] <mojca> [Coke], but unless [email@hidden.address] was actually installed *and* activated, you shouldn't have experienced any problems

[17:29] *** atta_ is now known as atta

[17:29] <mojca> you would probably get the problem if you would manually upgrade moarvm, but forget to upgrade nqp/rakudo

[17:29] <[Coke]> I get that. Just telling you what happened, what I did, and that it works now.

[17:29] <Woodi> brrt: libuv-1.8 branch compiles and tests for me (nqp and rakudo), debian 32bit

[17:30] <mojca> nevertheless I still don't understand how an old version could have interfered

[17:30] <[Coke]> moarvm and nqp should force an install of the corresponding version of nqp & moarvm.

[17:30] <[Coke]> ack. retry:

[17:30] <Woodi> mojca: module loader is under developmant :)

[17:30] <[Coke]> rakudo and nqp should force an install of the corresponding version of nqp & moarvm, respectively

[17:30] <[Coke]> mojca: I'm not asking you to explain it, I'm just telling you what I did.

[17:31] <mojca> [Coke]: I don't get exactly what you mean; that as soon as one installs moarvm 2016.01, one should also get nqp 2016.01?

[17:32] <mojca> I'm almost sure that this doesn't work.

[17:32] <mojca> But if users do "sudo port upgrade outdated", it should work as expected

[17:32] <mojca> and if users try to upgrade just nqp, moarvm will be upgraded first

[17:34] <mojca> Woodi: so I should simply stop worrying about the "P6M Merging GLOBAL symbols failed" error and assume it will get fixed?

[17:36] <ZoffixW> 0.o

[17:36] <ZoffixW> running panda install Linenoise did not show the error :/

[17:36] <mojca> ZoffixW, no it no longer fails

[17:36] <ZoffixW> Or rather RAKUDO_MODULE_DEBUG=1 panda --force install Linenoise

[17:37] <ZoffixW> hoelzro, I think it's different. The File::Find error is just panda aborting the install the moment it encounters an installed module

[17:37] <ZoffixW> (instead of just proceeding further)

[17:38] <stmuk> .tell [ptc] yay updating docs.perl6.org .. BTW *.un~ is a vim undo file which my .vimrc has enabled

[17:38] <yoleaux> stmuk: I'll pass your message to [ptc].

[17:40] <mojca> but I admit that I'm confused because I didn't change anything in my installation since yesterday when it was failing

[17:45] <mojca> ZoffixW, which File::Find error are you talking about?

[17:45] <hoelzro> I just made one commit to Linenoise to fix it last night

[17:46] <hoelzro> it was working then =/

[17:46] <hoelzro> ZoffixW: what's the failure look like?

[17:48] <ZoffixW> hoelzro, "===SORRY!=== P6M Merging GLOBAL symbols failed: duplicate definition of symbol Panda"

[17:48] <hoelzro> yikes

[17:48] <hoelzro> that's (hopefully) not Linenoise's fault

[17:48] <hoelzro> it's probably got something to do with Build.pm

[17:48] <ZoffixW> hoelzro, but then I re-ran panda --force install Linenoise and it installed fine, so I'm 99.999999999% sure it's the issue in panda

[17:48] <ZoffixW> (or lower up the food chain)

[19:13] <ZoffixW> :)

[19:13] <ZoffixW> uvtc_, what's the error

[19:14] <_sri> lizmat: just seen your comment at http://blogs.perl.org/users/jt_smith/2015/12/christmas-came-bah-humbug.html#comment-1644965

[19:14] <lizmat> _sri: did it make sense ?

[19:14] <_sri> lizmat: you mention specifically "event driven programming using supplies / async sockets / async file IO", why would that be faster in perl6 than perl5?

[19:15] <lizmat> well, syntactically, I don't think you can beat react / whenever / supply

[19:15] <lizmat> but from a performance point of view, it is really threaded

[19:16] *** SwellJoe joined
[19:16] <_sri> that only makes it sound like it should be bad for performance

[19:16] <lizmat> now, I'm not sure how Mojo handles this precisely, but I was under the impression that that was a select loop basically ?

[19:16] <Su-Shee> if I could log into blogs.perl.org I would give a business reason or two.. but I can't. 

[19:16] <uvtc_> ZoffixW: Error when trying to panda install Readline: https://gist.github.com/uvtc/03304823f8d03b3931f2

[19:16] <_sri> lizmat: mojolicious uses libev for scaling

[19:17] <ZoffixW> lizmat, yeah, it's not. I guess the best approach is to ignore this for now, unless more people experience my confusion, which is assuming plurals work for .new, just as they do for .later and not getting any errors when trying to use them in .new

[19:17] <lizmat> _sri: I didn't know that

[19:18] <Skarsnik> Zero_Dogg, still here? You can paste your code somewhere too?

[19:18] <_sri> lizmat: honestly, i would be very surprised if you could get close anytime soon performance wise

[19:18] <AlexDaniel> “Perl 6 is a bit sexier than Perl 5”. A *bit*. Right

[19:18] <ZoffixW> uvtc_, how old is your rakudo? I've seen a whole ton of NC fixes flying in in the past 20 hours

[19:18] <lizmat> _sri: well, we're going to try, that's for sure  :-)

[19:18] <lizmat> Su-Shee: if you want, I could channel you  :-)

[19:19] <flussence> I think, given node decided libuv is good enough for them, we can do pretty well with it too.

[19:19] <_sri> allright, was wondering if there was some async magic sauce i might have missed :)

[19:19] <uvtc_> ZoffixW: Just rm -f'd my ~/.rakudobrew and ~/.perl6 dirs. It's brand new.

[19:19] <lizmat> _sri: I think you're pretty much aware of everything going on here  :)

[19:19] <Su-Shee> lizmat: well I have an account and I'd love to write something useful. ;) anyways. the business case IMHO is "data". I usally sell perl6 is for text what julia is for numbers. 

[19:19] <ZoffixW> uvtc_, weird. Maybe Skarsnik would know. They were hacking on NC today

[19:20] <uvtc_> ZoffixW: Just curious, what's "NC"?

[19:20] <ZoffixW> uvtc_, NativeCall

[19:20] <[Coke]> NC is NativeCall

[19:20] <Su-Shee> lizmat: BUT it all means nothing without a proper set of modules doing.. "the usal stuff"

[19:20] <uvtc_> Ah. Thanks.

[19:23] <_sri> lizmat: just for completeness sake, mojolicious usually scales by using a manager process that spawns a bunch of processes that each run their own libev event loop

[19:23] <_sri> the traditional nginx model

[19:24] <lizmat> _sri: so there are no shared data structures ?

[19:24] <Su-Shee> lizmat: I'm selling perl6 here, not caring for underlying tech. :) I expect that to be fixed sooner rather than later because it actually brings perl6 en par with all the jvm based langs... otherwise, perl6 will soon get the question why it again wrote its own vm after all the parrot stuff. 

[19:24] <_sri> lizmat: nope, data is shared with databases or a pub/sub message bus

[19:25] <flussence> it's Apache2 that uses worker processes, and lighttpd uses libev, nginx doesn't ;)

[19:25] <lizmat> ok, so basically db or the forks::shared method

[19:29] <Su-Shee> ZoffixW: data, education, web for starters. thanks to the excellent data libraries combined with all the other stuff, it's taking over the R world at the moment.

[19:29] <[Coke]> perl6/doc - htmlify calls out to pygmentize; I have pygmentize-2.7 installed. Is the right approach for me to manually make a pygmentize alias, or to make htmlify try harder?

[19:29] <Su-Shee> ZoffixW: it is also by now THE language in education of all kinds.

[19:29] *** shicheng joined
[19:29] <ilmari> Su-Shee: one of the cons raised in the post was the lack of migration path, which Inline::Perl[56] helps with

[19:29] <Su-Shee> ZoffixW: there is no data related job ad without mentioning python.

[19:29] <ilmari> Su-Shee: and it's similar to your JVM argument: you can keep using all the cpan stuff

[19:30] <Su-Shee> ilmari: I see.

[19:30] <TimToady> nine: so...I run 'panda install Inline::Perl5', and it fails because Inline::Perl5 is "already installed", and then I do a make spectest, and it says: "Inline::Perl5 not installed: not running Perl 5 integration tests"...what's up with that?

[19:30] <Su-Shee> ilmari: on the other hand: why would I bother with perl6 then? I can use all the cpan stuff with perl5.

[19:33] <Su-Shee> alpha123: considering which languages so far have been "the scripting languages" or really "the languages" most in use it's certainly not the "doing something well" languages. "worse is better" applies a lot.

[19:33] <RabidGravy> does a "type lookup"

[19:33] <Zero_Dogg> Skarsnik: yep, that's when it segfaults

[19:34] <TimToady> nine: a force install makes it show up to spectest; is the already-installed check ignoring version number or something like that?

[19:35] <nine> TimToady: the already installed check really is just perl6 -e "exit !try { require Inline::Perl5; 1 }"

[19:35] <Su-Shee> but anyways, I'm not the marketing department for perl6, there's a perl foundation and what not which should be selling it and finding business arguments and use cases and all that jazz.

[19:40] <TimToady> autarch: we try to be very clear in the distinction between hard refs and symbolic in p6

[19:41] <autarch> TimToady: yeah, that's what I'm starting to figure out - it all makes sense, it's just new

[19:41] <TimToady> why we don't need 'strict refs' anymore

[19:41] <autarch> I'm used to the p5 "just fling stuff around and it'll work, sort of" approach ;)

[19:41] <Su-Shee> lizmat: well. you have my arguments. that's how I'd be selling perl 6. 

[19:41] <TimToady> same with $obj.$routine vs $obj."$routine"()

[19:41] <nine> TimToady: the installation process does consider versions just fine. You needed to to a panda update, because panda's meta data was out of date.

[19:41] <TimToady> okay

[19:41] <kittenlips> nine++ thanks a lot!!

[19:41] <autarch> TimToady: yep, that one also made sense once I realized that $routine could be a Routine object

[19:42] <autarch> I think a little extra typing is worth it for the clarity it provides

[19:42] <nine> TimToady: the spec test check failed because you had a version installed that wouldn't work anymore with rakudo nom

[19:42] <TimToady> funny thing is that we didn't actually anticipate that $obj.&subroutine would work, it just fell out that way :)

[20:01] <nine> Well the goal is to never ever break user code by updating a published version of the language. One way to do that is to just never update. Though right now there's not that much code relying on 6.c. There still can be changes that are reasonably safe to do.

[20:02] <lnrdo> http://venturebeat.com/2015/12/30/debian-founder-and-docker-employee-ian-murdock-has-died-at-42/

[20:02] <TimToady> the basic assumption should be that we don't break 6.c by default, but that we can grant a "variance" in some circumstances, but only after due consideration of how best to introduce the change over time

[20:06] <flussence> hasn't the rule always been "coercing to the same or looser type is a no-op"?

[20:06] <ZoffixW> AlexDaniel, consistency with other methods, such a .new that does not take plurals and silently ignores them. And adding them is expensive

[20:06] <yurivish_> oh, I didn't mean to map a say... That was me trying to reduce to a simpler test case

[20:06] <ZoffixW> AlexDaniel, spot the bug ^ :)

[20:07] <AlexDaniel> doesn't it mean that plurals should be better supported?

[20:07] <AlexDaniel> and not that we should get rid of them

[20:07] <ZoffixW> It's messy and expensive

[20:07] <yurivish_> the actual code I was trying to write seems to work now

[20:08] <AlexDaniel> as a user I don't really want to think whether it is “day” or “days”, I'd prefer it to work either way

[20:08] <TimToady> seems to me, if you were really worried about performance, you'd have a position new for DateTime that avoids named entirely

[20:11] <ilmari> mempko_: does kafka do sharding, like amazon kinesis? it would be neat to have the consumer automatically spawn a consumer thread per shard

[20:11] <flussence> just in time to put it back up again :)

[20:11] <ZoffixW> Begi, I was thinking of living it in until like middle of January, just for the people who missed it

[20:11] <perlpilot> yurivish_: by mentioning * twice, you got two different parameters to .map

[20:11] <gfldex> Begi: or replaced when we get something better until then

[20:11] <ZoffixW> Begi, or keeping permanently and removing the "new article daily" blurb

[20:11] <[ptc]> [Coke]: moritz helped me with this solution:  my $perl-pod = qqx{perl6-m -Ilib --doc=Perl $file};   Where one also defines a Perl parser for the pod...

[20:11] <yurivish_> I want ['3,4', '1,2']

[20:12] <[ptc]> stmuk_: cool, thanks for the info :-)

[20:12] <perlpilot> yurivish_: then use .map({ .key ~ ',' ~ .value })

[20:19] <skids> IMO IO::ArgFiles should be put back in and not removed till 6.d.  It is reasonable for a user of 6.c to interpret that test as "IO::ArgFiles is part of the spec" even if its internals are not tested.

[20:27] <autarch> what does this error mean - "Virtual call @.skip may not be used on partially constructed objects" ?

[20:27] <TimToady> I think that used to have a better message, but the innards are leaking somehow

[20:27] <autarch> I have a class with a BUILD submethod where I'm trying to set @.skip

[20:27] <perlpilot> autarch: you want to set @!skip

[20:27] <autarch> ah, that makes sense

[20:27] <TimToady> @.skip is really a call to self.skip

[20:28] <webstrand> When destructuring arrays, what's the use of the asterisk in my ($first, *@rest) = 1..20; It doesn't seem to change behaviour when missing like the documentation in Signature says it should.

[20:28] <perlpilot> autarch: the object isn't fully constructed in BUILD, so any calls to @.skip are ... what TimToady said

[20:28] <perlpilot> autarch: which can't work

[20:28] <autarch> yeah, that makes sense when I think about it

[20:28] <Skarsnik> . is an accessor x)

[20:28] <TimToady> which you can still do if you really mean it, but we don't want people falling into confusing virtual attributes with physical attributes by accident

[20:45] <TimToady> We are amused.

[20:45] <webstrand> Is destructuring using `my` supposed to work like subroutine parameters? I.e. is `my ($a, @b) = (1,2)` supposed to result in an error?

[20:45] <perlpilot> TimToady: Are there any "rules" for writing good spec tests written down somewhere?  autarch's LTA discovery had me wondering if there were any spec tests relying on the contents of an error message (I sure hope not!) and if there was anything that would aid in preventing such travesty

[20:47] <skids> perlpilot: well recently all the tests that demanded that an error message be contained in an X::AdHoc were change to just Exception, and in general when testing error messages you just need to be tolerant and only test for the minimum details being present.

[20:48] <skids> perlpilot: throws-like tests are usually where those are found, for examples.

[20:48] <webstrand> TimToady: Do you know where the rules for non-sig-like destructuring are documented?

[20:48] <autarch> what does $thing».method do? I can't find any mention of this on the doc site

[20:48] *** domidumont left
[20:49] <[Coke]> MadcapJake: echo "some stuff"

[20:49] *** ZoffixW left
[20:49] <autarch> MadcapJake: you might also want to use cat

[20:50] <MadcapJake> [Coke]: i think the problem is, I am trying to do `echo "some stuff" | echo` and that really does print a blank line

[20:50] <perlpilot> skids: I was feeling pretty good until you said "when testing error messages"   :)

[20:50] <MadcapJake> autarch: that's a good idea

[20:50] <Hotkeys> autarch: it ESSENTIALLY calls the method on all of the items in a list/array like a map

[20:50] <Hotkeys> but it does it with hyper

[20:50] <autarch> MadcapJake: no need for the '| echo ' bit - I don't think piping stuff _into_ echo does anything

[20:50] <Hotkeys> so in the future you may get the results out of order

[20:50] <[Coke]> autarch: http://design.perl6.org/S03.html#Hyper_operators

[20:50] <[Coke]> ... crap, that's not quite right. dammit. :)

[20:50] <MadcapJake> autarch: true, i guess I could just remove the pipe and pager and just leave it blank

[20:51] <autarch> so @array».foo is more or less like @array.map( { .foo } )?

[20:51] <perlpilot> Hotkeys: no, you'll always get the results *in* order, they just won't necessarily be processed in order

[20:51] <zengargoyle> echo 'foo' | cat

[20:51] <Hotkeys> oh

[20:51] <[Coke]> just don't pipe it to anything unless you need it.

[20:51] <hankache> autarch yes

[20:51] <MadcapJake> autarch: but cat seems to work well for this

[20:51] <Hotkeys> So I assume that's why you can't do $foo».say

[20:51] <Hotkeys> because they'll be said out of order

[20:51] <Hotkeys> maybe

[20:51] <Hotkeys> in future

[20:51] <autarch> MadcapJake: cat seems like a good option if you have a file you want to print to stdout

[20:52] <MadcapJake> part of me feels like the default should be pagerless, people can add a pager if they want (what do others think about this?)

[20:52] <perlpilot> Hotkeys: right-ish.

[20:52] <hankache> Hotkeys hyper gets the results in order

[20:52] <hankache> it's race that doesn't

[20:52] <zengargoyle> usually something like: FILTER=less; ( echo stuff; someprog-more-output; echo more stuff ) | $FILTER

[20:53] <zengargoyle> and then sometimes FILTER=cat

[20:53] <awwaiid> webstrand: looks like that is a weakness in the docs. http://doc.perl6.org/routine/%3D says the left-hand-side decides, which suggests that destructuring on the left in parens is from Array (and there is a link), but no doc that I can find

[20:53] <[Coke]> autarch: http://design.perl6.org/S12.html#Parallel_dispatch

[20:53] <sprocket> hello all!

[20:53] <autarch> is the use of $match.ast in grammars considered bad form? the docs now just use .made

[20:53] <hankache> so logically (in the future) they should be in order no?

[20:53] <sprocket> perl5 used to have a select builting function, but i don’t believe it’s built into perl6 - is there something that has replaced the need for it?  or was it expected to be provided in a external library?

[20:53] <nine> TimToady: that's ^^^ what I meant before

[20:54] <perlpilot> autarch: I dunno.  I've wondered that myself.  Both "do the same thing" for now though

[20:54] <nine> TimToady: https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127019

[20:54] <skids> perlpilot: e.g. look at S32-io/open.t where the only demans on the message are that the filename appear.

[20:54] <nine> sprocket: what do you need select for?

[20:54] <nine> sprocket: select in Perl 5 has 3 completely separate uses

[20:55] <webstrand> awwaiid: Thanks. Perhaps it's documented here: http://doc.perl6.org/type/List#Items%2C_Flattening_and_Sigils . But slurpy parameters don't seem to flatten in destructuring assignment.

[20:55] <sprocket> nine: personally, I don’t - I’d started a basic POSIX lib in the ecosystem, and someone was asking me about select :)

[20:56] <Begi> Can't we use "or die" with module's routine ?

[21:08] <sprocket> RabidGravy: were you able to use anything in RPi?

[21:08] <Idiosyncrat> The answer: I would characterize Perl 6 grammars as exponential worst case, and linear for LL(1)

[21:09] <Idiosyncrat> I've not gone through the Perl 6 grammar code like I have that for Perl 5, but here's the basis for my assertions:

[21:09] <RabidGravy> sprocket, I'm goint wrap the i2c-dev thing which provides all the methods I need :)

[21:09] <hoelzro> awwaiid: I was wondering if that would be best solved via a module

[21:10] *** FritzZaucker joined
[21:10] <hoelzro> you could easily do it via sub MAIN_HELPER(...) is export { }

[21:10] <Idiosyncrat> PEG is linear for LL(1), and I assume that the linear time complexity of Perl 6 grammars is no better and no worse.

[21:10] <lizmat> TimToady: there is a Date.new(year.month,day) candidate and similar DateTime candidate

[21:10] <awwaiid> hoelzro: short-term definitely; but the command pattern for cli is common enough it would be cool to have it in MAIN. I believe that TimToady or someone had specific ideas about some sort of sub-signature thing I didn't understand

[21:10] <hoelzro> ah, interesting

[21:11] <Idiosyncrat> I think this assumption is reasonable because the time complexity of parsing algorithms is not something you are likely to overcome unless you target it in a specific way, say via LL tables or some such.

[21:11] <nine> Zero_Dogg: is this with the absolutely current version?

[21:12] <FritzZaucker> Hi ... after failing with GTK::Simple I am trying NCurses now for a little Perl6 exercise. The following NCurses example is working: https://gist.github.com/zaucker/aa14025a16edcd671e25 whereas a similar one using a supply doesn't properly display the text: https://gist.github.com/zaucker/0290915997b1ddc3ad53 after a few iterations. Am I doing something wrong or am I hitting a bug somewhere?

[21:12] <Zero_Dogg> nine: yes, just installed now

[21:12] <nine> Zero_Dogg: how can I reproduce this issue?

[21:12] <Idiosyncrat> Similarly for the characterization of the worst case as exponential.  In general, top-down with backtracking goes exponential worst-case.

[21:13] <Zero_Dogg> nine: it's on my raspberry pi again, all I did was install it, and tried use Inline::Perl5;, resulting in that error

[21:14] <Zero_Dogg> nine: perl5 5.20.2, perl6 with rakudo on moar 2015.12, Inline::Perl5 installed through panda

[21:14] <RabidGravy> FritzZaucker, it's entirely possible the libcurses itself isn't entirely thread safe

[21:14] *** Arrowhead_ joined
[21:14] <Idiosyncrat> You can overcome this for top-down by using techniques like GLL, but even careful expert programming won't usually overcome the time complexity bound unless it uses special techniques targeted at the worse case bound.

[21:32] <lizmat> MadcapJake: perl6/doc contains tests ?

[21:33] <FritzZaucker> RabidGravy: meaning that I would have to re-draw the entire screen inside the timer callback to be on the save side?

[21:46] <Ulti> or is eager

[21:47] <webstrand> Is there any meaning to the slurpy operator in assignment? For instance:`my (*@a) = (1,2),(3,4)` seems like it should flatten (and one tutorial say that it does)

[21:47] <AlexDaniel> lizmat: yea, I don't get it. What's wrong with hyper?

[21:47] <hankache> i think hyper is drunk

[21:47] <lizmat> insufficiently tested ?  :-)

[21:47] <dalek> rakudo/nom: 

[21:47] <dalek> rakudo/nom: Pointer to Int doesn't make sense in NativeCall, since Int is no C type.

[21:47] <dalek> rakudo/nom: Use Pointer[int32] instead as that will translate to int* in C.

[21:49] <Ulti> hankache then the answer there is you are late binding the map rather than getting the "list" not sure that is how it should be working though

[21:52] <Ulti> might be a bug

[23:03] <RabidGravy> oh I thought I had remove the close from Supply

[23:04] <Notwang> RabidGravy: what did you give instead? ;f

[23:05] <RabidGravy> no from the doc

[23:05] <RabidGravy> what are you trying to do?

[23:06] <Notwang> RabidGravy: general idea of what I want to do http://paste.lisp.org/display/304214

[23:07] <ugexe> how do i use a specific version of a module?

[23:07] <dj_goku> weird

[23:07] *** pierre-vigier joined
[23:07] <jdv79> ugexe: doesnt it work mow?

[23:07] <jdv79> now

[23:07] <dj_goku> m: say enum E <:a(1) b c d>

[23:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar adb160: OUTPUT«Map.new((":a(1)" => 0,:b(1),:c(2),:d(3)))␤»

[23:07] <dj_goku> m: say enum E <<:a(1) b c d>>

[23:07] <camelia> rakudo-moar adb160: OUTPUT«Map.new((:a(1),:b(2),:c(3),:d(4)))␤»

[23:08] <dj_goku> m: say enum E <<:a(1) b :c(4) d>>

[23:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar adb160: OUTPUT«Map.new((:a(1),:b(2),:c(4),:d(5)))␤»

[23:08] <jdv79> :ver<0.011>

[23:08] <jdv79> on a use

[23:08] <ugexe> m: use Test:ver<*>;

[23:08] <camelia> rakudo-moar adb160: OUTPUT«===SORRY!===␤Could not find Test:ver<*> in:␤    /home/camelia/.perl6/2015.12-52-gadb1608␤    /home/camelia/rakudo-m-inst-1/share/perl6/site␤    /home/camelia/rakudo-m-inst-1/share/perl6/vendor␤    /home/camelia/rakudo-m-inst-1/share/perl6␤    C…»

[23:08] <RabidGravy> Notwang, just put the last whenever inside the first and call $conn.close

[23:08] <jdv79> i think i tried it.  it worked.  but i couldnt install multiple vers yet.

[23:09] <ugexe> does * not work for ver then?

[23:09] <jdv79> maybe dony do that for now:)

[23:09] <Notwang> RabidGravy: thanks (also just came up with it)

[23:10] <Notwang> RabidGravy: how can I create "whenever" blocks at runtime? is whenever equivalent to tap?

[23:10] <jdv79> its supposed to take anything that can smartmatch so i tbink it should work

[23:10] <jdv79> eventually

[23:10] <RabidGravy> whenever is like tap in some ways yes

[23:10] <Notwang> okay, thanks

[23:11] <RabidGravy> it just covers a frequent use case

[23:11] <ugexe> use CSV::Parser:auth<github:tony-o>; does not work either

[23:11] *** pierre-vigier left
[23:12] <RabidGravy> you could just put a "Promise.in(15).then({$conn.close})" in outer whenever

[23:12] <jdv79> nine might be the only one at this point that knows

[23:12] <ugexe> i thought avoiding dependency hell was suppose to be a key point before release

[23:13] <jdv79> we have some serious bus factor factors round here

[23:13] <jdv79> who said that?

[23:14] <jdv79> cur landed slightly too late so id say no to that:(

[23:14] <jdv79> nobody's fault...

[23:15] <lizmat> .oO( too many takers, not enough givers )

[23:15] <jdv79> we all suck:(  sorry.

[23:15] <ugexe> there were other givers that were turned down

[23:16] <lizmat> ugexe: ??

[23:16] <jdv79> kudos to those that tried and or did though!

[23:16] <ugexe> tony-o explicity offered

[23:17] <lizmat> well, if there's anything I've learned here, is that you should do instead of offer

[23:17] <lizmat> and be prepared to flush it down the drain if it isn't accepted after alle

[23:17] <lizmat> *all

[23:18] <ugexe> he did, and then boilerplate was merged

[23:18] <ugexe> and thus he did flush it

[23:19] <dalek> rakudo-star-daily: today (automated commit)

[23:19] <dalek> rakudo-star-daily: review: https://github.com/coke/rakudo-star-daily/commit/d2f859a0d4

[23:20] <jdv79> good news is its barely tested so it might be fixable under cover of 6.c:)

[23:20] *** devans2 joined
[23:22] <devans2> hiya, so i've installed perl6 and gotten some modules to install, is there a perl6 version of perldoc that i can run from the command line?

[23:22] <RabidGravy> p6doc

[23:22] <dj_goku> devans2: https://github.com/perl6/doc

[23:22] <RabidGravy> you'll need to install it like "panda install p6doc"  

[23:23] <devans2> ah thank you

[23:23] <RabidGravy> it'll install the core documentation, I'm not quire sure what the state of getting the module docs is right at this moment

[23:23] *** araujo left
[23:24] <jdv79> last i checked it was not goid.

[23:24] <jdv79> good

[23:24] *** araujo joined
[23:24] *** webstrand left
[23:24] <jdv79> as is the path was needed.  not the name.

[23:24] <lizmat> looking at the Supply doc, it seems to have missed an overhaul after the SSR

[23:25] <devans2> yeah, looks like p6doc fails to pass the tests on install, guess that's an opportunity to learn some more perl6

[23:25] <jdv79> ussr!

[23:25] <lizmat> it will probably have to wait until jnthn is back from R&R

[23:25] <jdv79> whats a ssr!

[23:25] <lizmat> Small Supply Refactor

[23:25] <RabidGravy> lizmat, I looked at it and took out some stuff

[23:25] <jdv79> i keep hitting ! instead of ?

[23:25] <jdv79> sorry

[23:25] <lizmat> aka the splitting off of Supplier

[23:26] <jdv79> ah, that.

[23:26] <lizmat> I need to think about this after a good night sleep

[23:26] <lizmat> so good night, #perl6 !

[23:26] <RabidGravy> yeah, I moved the emit and stuff to a new Supplier doc

[23:27] *** Notwang left
[23:27] <RabidGravy> and changed the introductory text to reflect the new world order but may not have reflected all the changes

[23:34] <ZoffixWin> flussence, can you press CTRL+F5 and try perl6.org again? I fixed the wrapon-two-lines thing this morning in https://github.com/perl6/perl6.org/commit/cbb9efa09230f5117be84d8ae6fab3c8c0d7c54a

[23:34] <ZoffixWin> flussence, and if the issue is still there... what browser/OS are you using (and screenshot, if possible). I'll fix it tomorrow morning :)

[23:34] <flussence> looks much better now :D

[23:34] <ZoffixWin> Ah \o/

[23:35] *** llfourn joined
[23:35] <dj_goku> ZoffixWin: just who I wanted to see!

[23:36] <ZoffixWin> orly :)

[23:36] <ZoffixWin> Why? :)

[23:36] <jdv79> lizmat: later

[23:36] <flussence> the right edge of that blue box in the announcement looks slightly weird to me because of the way the box shadow's placed, I think that's just me being picky though

[23:36] <dj_goku> ZoffixWin: so I saw your mr for lxymin was merged. I wanted to add a few examples of enum.

[23:36] <dj_goku> I guess I should just open a new PR

[23:37] <ZoffixWin> dj_goku, yeah

[23:37] <ZoffixWin> vendethiel / Ven has merge powers, I believe.

[23:37] <vendethiel> hi?

[23:37] <vendethiel> (either will highlight me on both clients :).)

[23:37] <ZoffixWin> :P

[23:37] <dj_goku> lol

[23:38] <vendethiel> dj_goku: yeah, I do the merges on lxiny often

[23:38] <dj_goku> Alright I'll a few enum examples.

[23:38] <dj_goku> and submit a PR!

[23:39] *** llfourn left
[23:40] <AlexDaniel> hmm, nobody commented on hyper issue and nobody submitted a bug report

[23:41] <AlexDaniel> I'll submit it then… if it is supposed to be this then ok, at least I'll get a nice email notification about that :)

[23:41] <ZoffixWin> Hyper issue?

[23:41] <AlexDaniel> m: my @result = eager ^10000 .hyper.map: * + 10; say @result ~~ @result.sort

[23:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar eca5df: OUTPUT«False␤»

[23:41] <AlexDaniel> m: my @result = eager ^5 .hyper.map: * + 10; say @result ~~ @result.sort

[23:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar eca5df: OUTPUT«True␤»

[23:41] <ZoffixWin> :o

[23:41] <AlexDaniel> hmm eager is not needed here

[23:41] <AlexDaniel> m: my @result = ^10000 .hyper.map: * + 10; say @result ~~ @result.sort

[23:41] <camelia> rakudo-moar eca5df: OUTPUT«False␤»

[23:42] <ZoffixWin> m: my @result = ^10000 .map: * + 10; say @result ~~ @result.sort

[23:42] <AlexDaniel> this should give True because hyper is supposed to give the results in the same order

[23:42] <camelia> rakudo-moar eca5df: OUTPUT«True␤»

[23:42] <AlexDaniel> at least that's how I understand it

[23:42] <ZoffixWin> Right

[23:43] <AlexDaniel> ZoffixWin: what did you win?

[23:44] <ZoffixWin> Win == Windows. My gaming "console" :P

[23:44] <AlexDaniel> Why not use “ZoffixWindows” then :D

[23:44] <ZoffixWin> Are you sure it's .hyper that's the issue?

[23:45] <ZoffixWin> m: my @result = ^10 .hyper(:1batch).map: *+0; say @result ~~ @result.sort

[23:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar eca5df: OUTPUT«False␤»

[23:45] <AlexDaniel> ZoffixWin: I have no idea

[23:45] <ZoffixWin> m: my @result = ^10 .hyper(:1batch).map: *+0; say [@result, @result.sort]

[23:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar eca5df: OUTPUT«[[0 2 1 3 4 5 6 8 9 7] (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)]␤»

[23:45] <AlexDaniel> something is definitely wrong…

[23:45] <ZoffixWin> Oh, right, order's messed up

[23:45] * ZoffixWin had a few beers and is blind

[23:46] <ZoffixWin> m: my $wrong; for ^10 { my @result = ^10 .hyper.map: *+0; $wrong++ unless @result ~~ @result.sort }; say $wrong

[23:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar eca5df: OUTPUT«(Any)␤»

[23:46] <ZoffixWin> m: my $wrong; for 1..10 { my @result = ^10 .hyper.map: *+0; $wrong++ unless @result ~~ @result.sort }; say $wrong

[23:46] <camelia> rakudo-moar eca5df: OUTPUT«(Any)␤»

[23:47] <ZoffixWin> At least it's consistent at being wrong :P

[23:47] <ZoffixWin> or wait

[23:47] <AlexDaniel> I don't think so

[23:47] <AlexDaniel> but maybe it is

[23:48] <ZoffixWin> m: my $wrong; for 1..10 { .say; my @result = ^100 .hyper.map: *+0; $wrong++ unless @result ~~ @result.sort }; say $wrong

[23:48] <camelia> rakudo-moar eca5df: OUTPUT«1␤2␤3␤4␤5␤6␤Memory allocation failed; could not allocate 15016 bytes␤»

[23:48] <ZoffixWin> Interesting.

[23:48] <ZoffixWin> eh... night all :)

[23:48] *** ZoffixWin left
[23:49] <AlexDaniel> no, it is not consistent

[23:50] <flussence> that last one prints out 1..10 and 6 on separate lines here

[23:51] <flussence> (and I've also learned through experimentation that `ulimit -m` has zero effect on my system...)

[23:52] <AlexDaniel> hah
