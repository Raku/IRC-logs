[01:07] * raydiak gave up on desktop linux and basically just runs it for the web browser and graphics work, virtually everything else gets done in the transparent terminal

[01:08] <Juerd> How is that not desktop linux?

[01:09] *** yeahnoob joined
[01:10] <raydiak> all the essential parts of my regular workflow work just as well sans X11, mainly excepting just the browser

[01:10] <raydiak> heck I've spent months at a time doing it all over ssh

[01:11] <Juerd> You're describing exactly how I've been using Linux, on the desktop, ever since I began using X.

[01:11] <Juerd> I don't really see how using an xterm makes it any less "desktop linux"

[01:12] <Juerd> With higher resolutions I have switched from a single fullscreen xterm to smaller 80x24 ones.

[01:13] <Juerd> (No, 80 chars isn't because my screen is small, it's because my screen is BIG, and I like having multiple terminals side by side.)

[01:13] <raydiak> I wouldn't describe that as much of a "desktop" as most people think of it

[01:13] <raydiak> honestly I think there's a more meaningful distinction to be made here than whether X is running

[01:14] <ugexe> yeah, like nto having to deal with all the linux desktop machine crap like driver issues

[01:16] <Juerd> raydiak: I move xterms around to suit whatever I'm doing. These floating window thingies are a real innovation :)

[01:17] <Juerd> And I use pointing devices to focus these windows. (Sloppy focus, of course.)

[01:18] <Juerd> Also, I do a lot of this: http://juerd.nl/i/65b1f14ff812c69fa4729b549aef7da9.png

[01:18] <Juerd> Don't you? Could you really work just as well on tty1..tty6? :P

[01:19] <raydiak> Juerd: I just have one giant full-screen-sized drop-down console; I switch windows with the keyboard; I'm not even sure I remember the last time I had 2 things open side by side in different X windows

[01:19] <raydiak> the last time I tried to go completely X-free, the main problem I had was some really nasty unicode limitations of the linux console

[01:19] <Juerd> I see. Are you on a 1024x768 display? :)

[01:19] <raydiak> that was last year

[01:20] <ugexe> FROGGS: didnt appear to help. same error

[01:20] <raydiak> 1600x900, though admittedly I do use the mouse to adjust the split sizes of the terminal after I boot up

[01:20] <Juerd> A-ha! :P

[01:20] <Juerd> I don't even do that, to be honest

[01:21] <Juerd> Something I do like about desktop linux: copy/pasting!

[01:22] <Juerd> It's why I have listchars off in vim. I use X select and paste more than vim's yank and paste

[01:22] <raydiak> true, though I wish there was only 1 clipboard

[01:22] <Juerd> A single clipboard can be had.

[01:22] <raydiak> I have vim's yank/paste tied to the x clipboard...or copy buffer...or whatever it is

[01:22] <Juerd> Try autocutsel

[01:23] <Juerd> Ooh, that's actually a nice idea. How does that work?

[01:23] *** perigrin joined
[01:23] <raydiak> :set clipboard=unnamed or unnamedplus

[01:23] <raydiak> iirc

[01:24] <raydiak> ah autocutsel looks nice, I'll keep it in mind when I switch desktops and distros in the hopefully near future

[01:24] <Juerd> Doesn't seem to work for me.

[01:52] <raydiak> Juerd: I guess my real point about "gave up on desktop linux" was that I've found relying too much on any particular linux desktop featureset to be a burden in several ways e.g. varying interoperability between different toolkits for things like drag and drop and DE integration, migrating settings for gconf-type-stuff is a pain, and getting things like colors and even keymaps to match everywhere can be a large

[01:53] <raydiak> undertaking...irritations like that

[01:54] <raydiak> so to the extent it feels practical and productive, I've moved whatever I can out of GUI land, even though I still am technically using X...just endeavour to minimize my reliance on such things

[09:09] <FROGGS_> eli-se: well, it appears for shell and spawn for moarvm

[09:09] <lizmat> FROGGS_: in the newio branch, all is forward slashes, as Win doesn't need backward slashes, I'm told ?

[09:09] <FROGGS_> eli-se: and then for the jvm

[09:09] <FROGGS_> lizmat: yes, that's why I am asking if we need that at the vm level or not

[09:10] <FROGGS_> lizmat: either windows really understands forward slashes and we can remove the slash replacement code in the VMs

[09:10] <FROGGS_> lizmat: or it does not, and that VM code supports the forward slashes for rakudo

[09:11] <FROGGS_> so, I am running a spectest for moarvm on windows now, then remove the slash replacement and spectest again

[10:12] <smls> .tell TimToady My ulterior motive is the attempt to find a good color scheme for a redesigned perl6.org (for after the 6.0 beta release), that *both* fits Camelia *and* has colors that are pleasant enough to be used as the background of larger areas. Which I can't seem to do with the current Camelia colors.

[10:12] <yoleaux> smls: I'll pass your message to TimToady.

[10:13] <smls> .tell TimToady But it might also help end the recurring resistance to Camelia as Perl 6's mascot; because even though Camelias detractors don't always communicate the source of their dislike clearly, I think it has much to do with the colors.

[10:48] <timotimo> http://testers.p6c.org/reports/30790.html - this is equally painful to watch

[10:48] <timotimo> in one case, the tests fail because of windows backslashes as file separators

[10:48] <|Tux|> what can I use instead of $*IN to support both "< hello.csv" and "hello.csv"

[10:48] *** MadcapJake joined
[10:48] <timotimo> that'd be $*ARGFILES

[10:49] <|Tux|> Type check failed in binding $buffer; expected 'Str' but got 'Failure'

[10:49] <timotimo> ARGFILES more or less only fakes being a file descriptor, as it is - in reality - more than one file object under the hood

[10:50] <timotimo> so if you're using ARGFILES in a low-level context, that may give you NYI things

[10:50] <|Tux|> so it cannot be used as a drop-in replacement

[12:22] *** alini left
[12:23] <nine_> Ven: you can declar a function's arguments' types but the caller can decider whether these should be checked or not. So you may declare your intention but cannot actually rely on your arguments having the types you declared.

[12:23] <Ven> nine_: ...

[12:23] <nine_> Feels like all the pain for no gain.

[12:23] <Ven> I don't have anything else to say.

[12:28] <timotimo> at least PHP is getting all those interesting features into the main stream of programming languages

[12:28] <nine_> And of course they make it kind of hard to say that you want strict type checks by making the user remember rules like the declare(strict_types=1); _must_ be the first statement in a file and that declare(strict_types=1) {} (block mode) is specifically disallowed.

[12:28] *** chenryn left
[12:28] <nwc10> nine_: oh, um, sweet. That competely buggers the refactoring approach of putting use strict; as the last line of a file, and moving it upwards, bit by bit by bit.

[12:29] <Ven> timotimo: I think python and ruby talked about having it before, though?

[12:29] <nine_> "Like the encoding directive, but unlike the ticks directive, the strict_types directive only affects the specific file it is used in, and does not affect either other files which include the file nor other files that are included by the file."

[12:29] <timotimo> yeah, but neither got it earlier :)

[12:29] <nine_> Lots and lots of special rules.

[12:30] <nine_> Like it's called "include" but actually does not work at all like an include but more like a require.

[14:55] <|Tux|> size_t depends on the Oracle version. most often it is a long long (64bit)

[15:11] <abraxxa> |Tux|: does sizeof return bits or bytes?

[15:11] <|Tux|> bytes

[15:12] <abraxxa> i could use int which also changes per platform

[15:20] <abraxxa> can I define my own native type which is also called size_t so that I have to specify the translation from the Perl to the C type only in one place and not change every method definition?

[15:21] <FROGGS_> abraxxa: I think you meant long when you said int

[15:22] <moritz> abraxxa: constant size_t = int32; # for example

[16:29] <trzef> is there a place on the internet where some cool scripts in perl6 that show the quality of the language can be seen?

[16:29] <TimToady> rosettacode.org

[16:29] <yoleaux> 10:12Z <smls> TimToady: What do you think of this: http://i.imgur.com/CeF13gV.png

[16:29] <yoleaux> 10:12Z <smls> TimToady: My ulterior motive is the attempt to find a good color scheme for a redesigned perl6.org (for after the 6.0 beta release), that *both* fits Camelia *and* has colors that are pleasant enough to be used as the background of larger areas. Which I can't seem to do with the current Camelia colors.

[16:29] <yoleaux> 10:13Z <smls> TimToady: But it might also help end the recurring resistance to Camelia as Perl 6's mascot; because even though Camelias detractors don't always communicate the source of their dislike clearly, I think it has much to do with the colors.

[16:30] <TimToady> see http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Perl_6

[16:33] <TimToady> also http://github.com/perl6/perl6-examples

[16:42] <[Coke]> in https://p6weekly.wordpress.com/2015/03/16/2015-11-native-arrays-arrive/, why does the first p5 example use integer?

[16:43] <[Coke]> (is that required with native ints?)

[16:44] *** trzef left

[16:44] <TimToady> [Coke]: it's just leveling the playing field by using the only effective integer declaration P5 has

[16:45] <TimToady> yeah, but that sucks as an internal API

[16:45] <[Coke]> TimToady: But if it's uneeded in that sample, seems like an unfair leveling.

[16:45] <[Coke]> which I get. there's marketing and stuff. :)

[16:46] <tbrowder> Thanks TimToady and [Coke].

[16:46] <TimToady> it actually does use different ops optimized for integers when you 'use integer' in P5

[16:59] <nwc10> heresy!

[17:00] <jnthn> heresy *and* typo

[17:00] <nwc10> the beer is good there?

[17:00] *** [Sno] left
[17:00] <jnthn> Only just got off teaching, not had any beer yet :)

[17:01] *** liztormato joined
[17:01] <jnthn> Last night's, however, was excellent

[17:03] <liztormato> colomon: I did not see much difference between use integer and without

[17:03] <TimToady> its main purpose is to for integer semantics where you might expect floating-point

[17:03] <liztormato> Thought it was best to add it anyway

[17:04] <TimToady> *force

[17:04] *** coffee` joined
[17:05] <liztormato> Oops I meant [Coke] ;-)

[17:06] <pmichaud> timotimo: +1

[17:06] <TimToady> and the purpose of the P 6 is not primarily to be readable, more like secret markings that happen to look like P 6 if you squint against the glare

[17:06] <pmichaud> oops, my +1 was in response to an apparently backscrolled item

[17:06] *** tinyblak left
[17:14] *** madmuid joined
[17:17] <TimToady> liztormato: your commit https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/42e6cda418 looks bogus to me; surely it should be paying attention to the itemization, not the Arrayness

[17:18] *** eli-se joined
[17:18] <TimToady> oh, it was bartolin's patch...

[17:18] <liztormato> Please don't blame the merger :-)

[17:19] <bartolin> TimToady: yes, that was from me. Mouq++ already pointed out that "flat $value" instead of "$value.flat" would have been better.

[17:20] <TimToady> oh, I see the comment an hour ago now

[17:20] <jnthn> liztormato: In general, if you're not sure if a patch is right or not, it's better *not* to merge it and leave it to somebody surer :)

[17:20] <TimToady> (still lackbogging)

[17:20] <bartolin> I just spectested the suggestion from Mouq and it passed all tests.

[17:20] <TimToady> bartolin++ Mouq++

[17:21] <TimToady> "Pay no attention the man behind the curtain!"

[17:21] <liztormato> jnthn: it passed all tests and made some todos pass

[17:22] <TimToady> and it flattens something itemized, which is suspect

[17:22] <TimToady> or versa vica

[17:22] *** mohij joined
[17:22] <bartolin> sorry for the trouble

[17:22] <TimToady> one of my points last night was that it's okay to be wrong temporarily :)

[17:23] <TimToady> so don't be sorry

[17:26] <moritz> somebody please throw some motivation my way

[17:26] <TimToady> do it for your kids

[17:26] <moritz> that would be playing with them, not hacking on perl6/doc :-)

[17:26] <jercos> I'm already wearing these shades, make the future bright so I don't look like a dork.

[17:27] <jercos> WHOOPS, TOO LATE

[17:27] <jnthn> moritz: But your kids can use the docs to learn Perl 6 in the future, which will be awesome! :)

[17:35] <bartolin> TimToady: my initial reason to fiddle with SEQUENCE was RT #80574 and the corresponding fudged test

[17:35] <synopsebot> Link: https://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=80574

[17:35] <bartolin> m: my @a := -> { "one", "two" } ... *; say @a[0]

[17:35] <camelia> rakudo-moar bad265: OUTPUT«one␤»

[17:35] <bartolin> do you agree that this should return only 'one'?

[17:36] *** J-L joined
[17:36] <TimToady> yes, you'd need $("one", "two") or ["one,"two"] to get both

[17:37] <bartolin> thanks

[17:37] <TimToady> but it sorta has nothing to do with being an array

[17:37] <TimToady> that's what set off me jitters :)

[17:38] <bartolin> (and rightly so :-)

[17:39] <J-L> Question:  Using Perl6's REPL interface, I notice that it won't let me enter multi-line code unless I end the line with a backslash.  So copying-and-pasting code into REPL won't work (without the backslashes at the end of each physical line).  Is that the way it's going to stay, or are there plans to change it to be more copy-and-paste-friendly?

[17:40] <arnsholt> It's a known bug in the REPL

[17:40] <arnsholt> I don't think we have a timeline for when it'll be fixed, though

[17:44] *** lizmat joined
[17:47] *** tinyblak joined
[17:48] <J-L> arnsholt:  Thanks!  It's good to hear that the issue is temporary.  Or supposed to be, at least.

[17:50] <TimToady> our own readline in P6 might be a good project for someone of a hacky disposition, and might serve as the basis for a better REPL

[17:51] <TimToady> then we could avoid both license and unicode issues

[17:51] *** perigrin left
[17:51] <TimToady> the main thing to learn would be which characters are double-wide in the typical terminal

[18:04] *** bayprogrammer joined
[18:05] <hoelzro> itz_: I agree; I think for that to happen, though, we would need an NQP/VM level op for attaching a completion callback to readline/linenoise

[18:05] <hoelzro> now that NativeCall is core, though, is it necessary to have linenoise/readline stuff in NQP or MoarVM?

[18:05] *** pecastro left
[18:06] *** virtualsue left
[18:09] <jnthn> hoelzro: I wouldn't be sad to see linenoise go

[18:09] <jnthn> It's a mess on Windows.

[18:09] <jnthn> Worse than not having it.

[18:10] <jnthn> And a REPL written in NQP or Perl 6 would mean maintaining it once on Moar and JVM too, if it's done using NativeCall

[18:13] *** Hor|zon left
[18:19] *** eli-se joined
[18:20] <hoelzro> would LineNoise.pm/ReadLine.pm just ship with Rakudo, then?

[18:20] <hoelzro> or should the REPL look for the modules and enable them if available?

[18:20] <eli-se> woo

[18:23] <LonelyGM> m: say <watching champions league>

[18:49] <masak> what's an idiomatic way in Perl 6 to say ".pick($n), but retain the order of the original list" ?

[18:50] <jdv79> quoted strings are like barewords except the quotes - mind blown...

[18:50] <colomon> masak: pick on the size of the list, sort the results and use them to get a slice of the original?

[19:28] <labster> Well, at this point, I'm sure one of my modules stumbled on the compiler.

[19:28] * masak has been teaching Python for two days

[19:28] <FROGGS_> timotimo: one of these? http://testers.p6c.org/auths-L.html

[19:28] <lizmat> hugme: hug masak

[19:29] <lizmat> then the hug is a bonus!

[19:29] <FROGGS_> masak: {} - take these, it is dangerous out there

[19:29] <masak> lizmat: I actually asked $boss if I could create this course, so we'd get more courses like the Perl course :)

[19:29] <timotimo> i think it was the one where i saw the comparisons between forward-slashed and backward-slashed paths as well as the reliance on ordering

[19:29] <masak> FROGGS_: Python put all of them in their formatting strings.

[19:29] <[Coke]> Are due for an nqp stage0 rebuild soon?

[19:29] <[Coke]> *we due

[19:29] <FROGGS_> [Coke]: I dont think so... why?

[19:30] <moritz> masak: I'm doing quite some python for $work, and I find that I spend quite some time debugging things where functions return None...

[19:30] <moritz> masak: simply because I forgot an explicit 'return' :-)

[19:30] <masak> moritz: yeah.

[19:30] <masak> moritz: it happens to me all the time.

[19:30] <masak> moritz: sometimes in JavaScript too

[19:30] <FROGGS_> or C

[19:31] <masak> hm, no. I never do that in C.

[19:31] <labster> timotimo: Ah, that module.  Yeah, I'll fix when I get tuits

[19:31] <timotimo> cool :)

[19:31] <FROGGS_> in P5 I usually think "ohh damn" in the middle of writing down a signature :/

[19:31] <masak> FROGGS_: I thought p5 had them now?

[19:32] <FROGGS_> masak: not on all of our production machines sadly

[19:32] <FROGGS_> labster: when you compare paths, use .cleanup on both LHS and RHS of is()

[19:33] <moritz> also, python is full of WTFs for me

[19:33] <moritz> iterating over keys and values of a dict

[19:33] <labster> FROGGS_: that is a great suggestion, thanks.

[19:33] <moritz> for k, v in d.iteritems()

[19:33] <moritz> huh?

[19:33] <masak> things I am jealous of Python for as a Perl 6 dev: a clear concept of "hashable" built into the language. a small, sensible set of core collection types. bound methods. (*sob*) a better REPL than ours.

[19:34] *** eli-se left
[19:34] <moritz> also, (at least in py3), 'del' exists both as function and sub

[19:34] <moritz> but 'print' only as a function

[19:34] <moritz> masak: yes, hashable is good

[19:34] <masak> moritz: I taught people about 'del', and then immediately told them that using it is a code smell.

[19:34] <masak> moritz: and bound methods!

[19:35] <moritz> masak: so, what does one use instead of del?

[19:35] <masak> I still can't believe how right Python gets bound methods. I need to study it more to understand how they seem to have basically no wtf-y corner in that part of the design.

[19:35] <masak> moritz: it's like asking, "so, what does one do instead of getting eaten by a lion?"

[19:36] <moritz> also, it's kinda weird that len() and del() are subs, not methods

[19:36] <masak> just don't go near the bloody lion, and you'll be fine.

[19:36] <moritz> masak: huh? I just want to delete items from dicts, for example

[19:36] <masak> moritz: yes. it's weird.

[19:36] <timotimo> or lists, yeah

[19:36] <masak> moritz: oh, deleting from dicts is mostly fine. deleting variables ain't.

[19:37] <masak> moritz: even so, I find I don't delete from dicts so much either. not so much because it's bad; just that the case doesn't arise so much.

[19:37] <jercos> len() is the one that gets me every time. is it length(foo)? no? foo.length? no? foo.len()? no? oh! right, len(foo).

[19:37] <jercos> I've gone through a process nearly identical to that dozens of times :|

[19:37] <moritz> masak: mostly? :-)

[19:37] *** regreg joined
[19:37] <masak> moritz: I still maintain that there are better ways sometimes.

[19:38] <moritz> masak: dict.pop?

[19:38] <masak> no; just don't go near the bloody lion.

[19:38] <masak> sorry, I'm explaining it badly.

[19:38] <FROGGS_> the lion must be drawn here?

[19:39] <masak> deleting things that you added to a structure is a sign of a poor design.

[19:39] <jercos> like taking the tabs off manilla folders.

[19:39] <masak> even if the structure happens to be something as mutable as a dict.

[19:39] <jercos> Stop recycling the same folders, go to officemax and buy another pack :|

[19:39] <masak> jercos: right. you get me.

[19:39] <timotimo> ooh, is this a contest? who wins gets the masak? :D

[19:40] <masak> very unique offer!

[19:40] <vendethiel> mmh

[19:40] <FROGGS_> :D

[19:40] <moritz> masak: for struct-like things I agree. Not so much for typical 'seen' hashes etc.

[19:40] <vendethiel> I think I had a better one somewhere

[19:40] <masak> moritz: sometimes you wish you'd unseen something? :P

[19:40] <FROGGS_> ohh yes

[19:41] * masak .oO( what is this, Friday? )

[19:41] <[Coke]> FROGGS_: shouldn't we do it semi-frequently, with the thought that we're able to generate more awesome results with newer nqps?

[19:41] <timotimo> masak: it's a joke. and don't call me Friday.

[19:41] <moritz> masak: ok, not seen, but tracking items to-be-done by key, for example

[19:42] <FROGGS_> [Coke]: this will more likely just eat disk memory and will make the git repo explode

[19:42] *** nige left
[19:42] <FROGGS_> [Coke]: and we already compile nqp twice when we build the nqp that gets installed

[19:43] <FROGGS_> so there is no need for a more optimized nqp in stage0

[19:43] <FROGGS_> unless you want to speed up building stage1

[19:44] *** tgt joined
[19:45] *** spider-mario left
[19:45] *** aoeuhtns left
[19:46] <timotimo> that's only a tiny fraction of the actual compile time, isn't it?

[19:46] <timotimo> and i don't think we've had a lot of improvement in the code-gen or optimization of nqp itself in the recent months

[19:46] <masak> moritz: mark the item as done; leave it in the hash.

[19:46] <FROGGS_> yes yes

[19:47] *** spider-mario joined
[19:47] <masak> moritz: a "done" item tells you more about the outcome than a missing item.

[19:50] <tgt> Hi. For some reason rakudo has very high memory usage on an Ubuntu VM I use. Any suggestions about how to figure out why? It's a VM at work so I can't look into it now. https://gist.github.com/tgt/090214c4e2a529820189

[23:16] <adu_> ok, I'll work on getting rosettacode write access

[23:17] *** geever left
[23:17] <CurtisOvidPoe> Still trying to find the docs/discussion on .kxxv

[23:18] <adu_> grondilu, so what is the "Digest" interface?

[23:18] <vendethiel> .u ᐛ

[23:18] <yoleaux> U+141B CANADIAN SYLLABICS NASKAPI WAA [Lo] (ᐛ)

[23:18] <grondilu> adu_: sub digest-function(Blob $b --> Blob) {...}

[23:18] <adu_> grondilu, is it just a module with a function from Str to Blob?

[23:19] <adu_> because that won't work for Shake128

[23:19] *** Osto joined
[23:19] <grondilu> adu_: no, it should take only a Blob as input, since Str to binary is encoding-dependant.

[23:19] <grondilu> the user is supposed to encode the string himself before feeding the disgest

[23:19] <adu_> grondilu, how would you recommend handling Shake128/256?

[23:20] <grondilu> I don't know about those.

[23:20] <adu_> grondilu, they're digest/hash functions from N bytes to M bytes

[23:20] <adu_> so you need a way to specify how much digest you need

[23:20] <grondilu> then you can use a where clause until sized arrays are implemented.

[23:21] <adu_> Ideally, it would be implemented using I/O interfaces, like .read(M) -> Blob of M bytes

[23:21] *** Osto left
[23:21] *** ostomachion joined
[23:21] <grondilu> oh yu mean M is a parameter?

[23:21] <adu_> yes

[23:22] <grondilu> :output-size then

[23:22] *** LonelyGM joined
[23:22] <adu_> grondilu, oh, like a symbolic parameter

[23:22] <grondilu> no

[23:22] <grondilu> hang on

[23:23] <adu_> shake128:output-size(32)(msg)?

[23:23] <grondilu> sub digest-function(Blob $, :$ouput-size = 128) returns Blob {...}

[23:23] <adu_> ah

[23:23] <adu_> ok

[23:23] <grondilu> something like that anyway

[23:23] <adu_> that makes sense

[23:24] <adu_> it's part of sha3

[23:25] <adu_> aren't those semantically equivalent?

[23:25] *** lichtkind left
[23:28] <grondilu> one other possibility would be:

[23:29] <skids> adu_: in Sum I just export parametric roles so if you need other than common parms you can make your own class.

[23:29] <grondilu> ah no I've just realized what I was thinking would not work.  forget it.

[23:31] * grondilu was thinking about something like multi hash(Blob $, :$sha256! --> Blob) {...} but was not sure about how to write a proto for that.

[23:36] <skids> At the same time, for common parameter sets I really need to build a catalogue so you can do lookups not only of the class, but by crypto strengths, MAGNET ids etc.

[23:36] *** tinyblak left
[23:37] <skids> Anyway I'm partway through a native Whirpool myself.  Unless you use the LUTs it is a pretty hard algo to code compared to SHA/MD

[23:43] <skids> s/native/pure perl/

[23:45] *** osto joined
[23:46] <osto> Hello, I have a question and heard that this would be a good place to ask

[23:50] <grondilu> osto: shoot

[23:53] <osto> So, I'm teaching myself Perl 6 focusing on grammars right now, I have some experience in Perl 5. I'm trying to write a regex that would match a character with the Open_punctuation property, then anything with out the Open/Close property, then the matching closing character

[23:53] *** adu_ left
[23:53] *** mohij left
[23:54] *** adu_ joined
[23:54] <osto> I think the only part I'm missing is the matching closing character

[23:54] <adu_> skids, Sum? where can I find that?

[23:55] <skids> adu_: panda install Sum, unless it's been broken lately.

[23:55] <adu_> cool

[23:55] <skids> It runs a lot of tests though so plan for a hot lap.

[23:55] <adu_> ok, I'll check it out, I would much prefer Roles to specific function names

[23:56] <adu_> "hot lap" lol, I'll use that next time I need to refer to a well-tested library

[23:56] *** madmuid left
[23:58] <skids> Has FROGGS++ pushed the C++ nativecall stuff yet?  I was thinking of rolling in libbotan, whose C API is too new to be in most distros yet.

[23:59] <skids> .karma C

[23:59] *** LonelyGM left
[23:59] <adu_> skids, also, earlier, I was working on something related to NativeCall

[23:59] <adu_> I might have to maintain that
