[07:12] <nine> ShimmerFairy++ as well :)

[07:15] <ShimmerFairy> nine: are you sure your implementation of Seq.perl won't consume the Seq in the process?

[07:16] *** rindolf joined
[07:17] <nine> ShimmerFairy: oh I'm sure it does. Same as .gist. I just don't see the harm. .perl is usually used for debugging and in addition is supposed to return something that can EVAL back into the original object. For that we have to consume it.

[07:17] <ShimmerFairy> of course not, I just wanted to make sure it doesn't consume the Seq where it's not supposed to :)

[07:18] <ShimmerFairy> And if you consume it in .perl, you render the Seq useless. So if that .list consumes it, you'll have to change it so that it clones the Seq and exhausts the clone instead.

[07:18] <nine> The irony is, that instead of expected: Seq.new, got: Seq.new I now get expected: ("foo", "hate").iterator, got: ("foo", "hate").iterator

[07:19] *** darutoko joined
[07:21] <nine> ShimmerFairy: Numeric, Int, Str, Stringy, fmt, gist, AT-POS and EXISTS-POS all consume the iterator. None clone.

[07:22] <ShimmerFairy> nine: AFAIK that's a mistake. Seq shouldn't be consumed by things like gist and perl, at least.

[07:22] <ShimmerFairy> that is, if you stick a  say $seq.perl;  in the middle of your code while debugging, that shouldn't break subsequent use of the Seq.

[07:26] <laben> ShimmerFairy: about our dicussion yesterday, CORE code assumes that if both a class and a role have implemented the same only method, the role one gets skipped entirely. see Bridge in Int and in Real (Int does Real, btw)

[07:26] <nine> ShimmerFairy: I'm not sure I'm really qualified to have this discussion.

[07:27] <nine> ShimmerFairy: I certainly see your point. On the other hand, consuming a Seq can have side effects, can't it? Cloning therefore could lead to even more surprises.

[07:28] <ShimmerFairy> I don't know of any side-effects it would have, but the point is that sticking a  say $seq.perl  in your code when debugging shouldn't suddenly give an empty Seq down the line. Debugging tools are not typically supposed to affect the outcome of code :P

[07:30] <ShimmerFairy> laben: that's an interesting example. The signatures are textually different, but the role and class both use their own name there. Since the role's stuff "becomes" the class' stuff, in most ways, that might not count as a conflict. Hm.

[07:30] <jdv79> well its lazy so what is one supposed to do?

[07:31] <ShimmerFairy> (look at the "ambiguous call" error you get when you have an identical multi method defined in a role and a doing class: the candidates printed both use the _class'_ name)

[07:31] <jdv79> maybe .list it at least to not lose it

[07:32] <nine> ShimmerFairy: side effect ^^^

[07:33] *** Ven left
[07:35] <laben> ShimmerFairy: consider that the implemented method in the class has a narrower sig that the role "interface" one...

[07:36] <ShimmerFairy> laben: true. I think you'd have to use ::?CLASS if you really meant the class that will be doing the role.

[07:37] <ShimmerFairy> Although perhaps the invocant argument needs to be handled differently than other arguments, who knows?

[07:39] <laben> ShimmerFairy: you mean that while composing a method from a role, it should check which param is Role and allow it to be Class when comparing the sig?

[07:39] <ShimmerFairy> My current intuition says that the something like  method foo(Role $a:)  would be overridden by  method(Class $a:)  , since a 'Role' invocant wouldn't make sense in the class anyway (I don't think).

[07:40] <ShimmerFairy> laben: at least for the invocant specifier (which just describes the object itself, e.g.  class Bar { method foo(Bar:D:) }  says that Bar.foo needs to be called on a "real" (instantiated) Bar object)

[07:41] <laben> ShimmerFairy: mh, i think we can do that just about only to the sel param, yes. messing with the others is sure to mess up what the class writer means to achieve

[07:41] <ShimmerFairy> Basically, I think    role R { method M(R: R $a, R $b) { } }; class C { method M(C: R $a, R $b) { } }    would be just fine, but (say) M(C: C $a, C $b) would cause a conflict of multiple 'only' methods.

[07:42] <ShimmerFairy> (er, with a 'does R' on the class, duh :P)

[07:42] <laben> ShimmerFairy: understood, makes sense to me

[07:42] <ShimmerFairy> laben: yeah, I think if the role means to specify whatever class will be doing the role, it'll have to use ::?CLASS (or however its spelled) in the other arguments.

[07:43] *** AlexDaniel joined
[07:44] <laben> ShimmerFairy: unfortunately, i think other conflict could be seen if class specifies those other params to be C rather than R

[07:44] <ShimmerFairy> just for the sake of making sure it's clear, M(C: C $a, C $b) would only work (in my thinking) if the role declared that same signature, or more generically, M(C, ::?CLASS $a, ::?CLASS $b) (again however ::?CLASS is actually spelled)

[07:46] <ShimmerFairy> laben: yes. If the role says it expects an argument of its own kind to appear $thing.foo(HERE), then the class can't narrow down that expectation. But the invocant argument specifies the thing you're calling the method on, and that naturally changes in role composition.

[07:46] <laben> iiuc we would preclude this from working: role R {method M(R: R $a, R $b){}}; class C does R { method M(C: C $a, C $b){}}

[07:47] <laben> ShimmerFairy: ok, i'm clear on this now

[07:47] <ShimmerFairy> Yes. The R: will naturally become a C: when you do role composition, so the conflict detector should check for that. The other Rs are asking for any kind of R-doing thing, so you can't spell that out as C instead.

[08:14] <ShimmerFairy> couldn't pre-GLR contain mutables too? :)

[08:14] <TimToady> yes, in which case it didn't proviede a value type

[08:15] <ShimmerFairy> If you wanted a truly immutable list type, how would you detect and disallow mutable things?

[08:46] <laben> jnthn: what type have the decont'ed code_objs passed to add_method? is it not Routine?

[08:46] <jnthn> laben: The ones the compiler passes will typically be Method/Regex

[08:46] <jnthn> Well, or Submethod

[08:46] <laben> jnthn: do these have no .code method?

[08:46] <jnthn> The MOP cares little though, it assumes you're giving it something invokable

[08:47] <jnthn> What would a .code method do?

[08:47] *** pochi joined
[08:47] <jnthn> They already *care* code objects.

[08:47] <jnthn> uh, *are*

[08:47] <laben> i wanted to get the signatures, thought i would do .code.signature

[08:47] <jnthn> Just .signature?

[08:47] <laben> maybe i just need to do .signature, then?

[08:47] <laben> jnthn: thanks

[08:47] <jnthn> :)

[08:48] <ShimmerFairy> My first idea is that Lists could apply operators like === in a chaining fashion, i.e. [===] @a-List

[09:51] <JimmyZ> I would like to see the new POD 6 parser 

[09:53] <ShimmerFairy> thanks. It'll take some time, though :)

[09:54] <nine> Well, it's also about time :)

[09:57] <JimmyZ> :

[09:59] <ShimmerFairy> I remember back when rakudo didn't even have a Pod parser, and I tried foolishly tried writing one. But it was outside of rakudo, and I didn't want to play along with all the Pod:: classes as mentioned.

[09:59] <ShimmerFairy> So it's kinda funny and surreal to find myself doing the same exact thing a few years later, but for totally different reasons :P

[10:01] <JimmyZ> A few year ago, rakud core is full of PIR :)

[10:02] <JimmyZ> *was

[12:41] <ShimmerFairy> There were plans to move to CPAN at some point, but I do not know where those plans are status-wise.

[12:42] <jdv79> also, can a version be a git hash?

[12:43] * ShimmerFairy still isn't sure having P5 and P6 modules live so close together on one system is a good idea, fwiw

[12:45] <[Coke]> ISTR lots of work was done to map out how to safely put sixperl things on cpan.

[12:45] <ShimmerFairy> People who know both languages probably feel differently, but for me it's super weird to insist on having Perl 5 and Perl 6 code be handled by the same system, when they aren't at all the same language.

[12:45] <jdv79> where is it

[12:45] <[Coke]> ShimmerFairy: insist? 

[12:45] <[Coke]> It's less weird than having to build cpan from scratch.

[12:46] <[Coke]> we don't have to reinvent every where.

[12:46] <[Coke]> *wheel

[12:46] <jdv79> i just think about how much work and resources it would take

[12:46] <[Coke]> jdv79: I'm remembering a snippet of conversation that occurred sometime in the last 5 years.

[12:46] <ShimmerFairy> [Coke]: well, it seemed last time that people were really keen on trying to slap stuff onto CPAN, since it's such a 5 thing. I still find it odd that our RT system is the same as P5's, for example.

[12:46] <jdv79> the cpan ecosystem isnt simple or tiny

[12:46] <|Tux|> still no panda on glr

[12:47] <[Coke]> there was an early draft that was the result of a TPF grant that went nowhere. There was a more recent discussion that occurred, I think, at a perl qa hackathon. I *think* lizmat was involved.

[12:47] <[Coke]> ShimmerFairy: "why reinvent the wheel"

[12:47] <jdv79> lizmat: ?

[12:47] <ShimmerFairy> [Coke]: I don't remember much from when CPAN stuff was happening here, but I vaguely recall that the setup was very much "try to fit it on CPAN in a way that won't cause problems", which makes P6 seem like an unimportant afterthought

[12:48] <[Coke]> having gone through this on parrot before, there's a great desire to do everything ourselves, but then that leaves little time to do the actual thing we're trying to do.

[12:48] <|Tux|> jdv79, markov was also working on CPAN6 iirc

[12:48] <nine> |Tux|: no, but it's much further along. I also have a glr branch of panda on github.com/niner/panda

[12:48] <[Coke]> ShimmerFairy: I think you're projecting.

[12:48] <ShimmerFairy> [Coke]: I'd much prefer a setup that was appropriate for Perl 6, not a setup that tries to shoehorn itself into an existing system

[12:49] * |Tux| is sooooooo eager to see possible gain of GLR on Text::CSV :)

[12:49] <jdv79> thats akin to saying lets reinvent github kinda

[12:49] <jdv79> no thanks

[12:49] <ShimmerFairy> [Coke]: Like I said, people who know 5 and 6 would probably feel different from me. But as someone who knows 6 and nothing of 5, it's always strange when people try to stuff both languages into the same room.

[12:50] <nine> ShimmerFairy: I was at the QAH and was advocating for using CPAN for 5 and 6 (still am). There was interest there for sure.

[12:50] <[Coke]> ... the other room is -already built-. :)

[12:50] <[Coke]> it's got a lot of nice furniture.

[12:50] <jdv79> its not really about p5 and p6.  its more about cpan being state of thecart.

[12:50] <nine> |Tux|: then please help making glr a reality :)

[12:50] <jdv79> the art

[12:51] <ShimmerFairy> I did eventually sign up for a CPAN account, but IIRC I've never liked how I had to provide a full name (I only relented when I saw I could get by with initials)

[12:51] <ShimmerFairy> And I've not touched that CPAN account, and for various reasons would like an account with different names attached to it now :)

[12:52] <jdv79> trivial details in context.

[12:52] <ShimmerFairy> [Coke]: there's also the fact that CPAN feels really... old, last time I looked at it. Even if I were programming Perl 5, I suspect I wouldn't use CPAN to publish my stuff. (It's just... bleh)

[12:52] <jdv79> but if you want to impl p6 cpan, testers, pause, mirrors, metacpan, etc... plesse:)

[12:52] <jdv79> please

[12:53] <|Tux|> nine, how?

[12:55] <nine> |Tux|: my first attempt at helping was finding out how much of Inc.pm we can run before crashing. That was just a week ago. It's really 90 % just mechanical work and 10 % banging one's head.

[12:56] <nine> For the NYI methods I usually find a close enough method to use as a template.

[12:56] <ShimmerFairy> jdv79: why no, it just doesn't impress me.

[12:56] * |Tux| works with Oracle: enoungh headbanging already

[12:56] <jdv79> cpan is why alot, perhaps most, use p5!

[12:56] <jdv79> geez

[12:57] <jdv79> gotta respect the cpan...

[12:57] <ShimmerFairy> (also, please refrain from --'ing people, especially over their opinions. That's just rude.)

[12:58] <jdv79> i did include a :)

[12:58] <nine> ShimmerFairy: http://metacpan.org looks quite fresh to me :) It's just http://pause.cpan.org that could use a re-vamp. But I only see that when uploading a dist and that's not all that often. Heavy contributors have that step automated anyway.

[12:59] <|Tux|> no, I do not have that automated

[12:59] <|Tux|> all hand-work

[12:59] <ShimmerFairy> nine: yeah, admittedly it's PAUSE that looks and acts like it's straight out of the 80s. _Emailing_ people to _manually_ make an account? Demanding a full name from people, who may like me not enjoy giving out personal info freely?

[12:59] <|Tux|> but that is mainly because my pre-release tests take so much time

[13:00] <ShimmerFairy> nine: I suppose in reality, I just don't want Perl 6 to be a second-class citizen on CPAN (which as I recall the latest plan for CPAN involved making sure not to upset P5's tools, which is kinda lame to me)

[13:01] <ShimmerFairy> Perl 6 is kinda a big deal; too bad if your P5 CPAN tools need a little updating :P

[13:01] <|Tux|> my LT in Granada will be about pre-release actions

[13:02] <DrForr> My big thing there is making perl6-1.0 available on perlbrew, that would go a ways toward adoption.

[13:02] <nine> ShimmerFairy: I for sure don't want Perl 6 to be a second-class citizen on CPAN. I also think, that we can work together to avoid that. Of course, backwards compatibility is and always has been an issue. But certainly one worth the gain.

[13:03] <ShimmerFairy> nine: sure, for example I wouldn't dream of suggesting "if P6 modules have to be in Perl6/ subdirs on accounts, then you better be equal and move P5 modules to a Perl5 subdir !!!" :)

[13:06] <ShimmerFairy> nine: though I'll never be caught dead using P5 modules in P6 code :D

[13:06] <mst> ShimmerFairy: your disappointingly combative attitude is the sort of thing that led to a lot of perl5 people hoping perl6 wouldn't use CPAN at all

[13:06] <mst> "I don't want to be a second class citizen of the thing somebody else already built and maintained for 20 years for me"

[13:07] <mst> well, ok, then don't use it at all

[13:07] <ShimmerFairy> pmurias: I've historically been a _very_ private person, so requiring a full name is pretty unreasonable for me (I'm more comfortable with my name now, funny enough, but still)

[13:07] <jdv79> yeah...:(

[13:07] <mst> me, I'll keep working with the people who actually care about perl5 and perl6

[13:07] <jdv79> cant we all just be friends?

[13:07] <jdv79> sorry

[13:08] <mst> also, the perl5 tooling is full of cruft but the perl6 tooling is currently essentially the one to throw away

[13:08] <mst> so there's plenty of room for things to work together later

[13:08] <ShimmerFairy> mst: Sorry for coming off as combative, it's just that as someone who enjoys Perl 6, I'm generally frustrated when Perl 6 isn't treated as its own thing (being shoehorned into CPAN instead of making CPAN support the two equally, the specs assuming P5 knowledge, etc.)

[13:08] <ShimmerFairy> who enjoys Perl 6 with no knowledge of Perl 5, to be clear

[13:08] <mst> 'making CPAN support' - so you want perl5 to be second class instead

[13:09] <mst> which is why you're getting pushback

[13:09] <mst> you can't -make- a volunteer run system do anything

[13:09] <mst> either be nice, or build your own

[13:09] <ShimmerFairy> mst: I'm not saying that at all, I'm saying both should be supported equally.

[13:09] <mst> either be nice, or build your own

[13:09] <mst> yes, you are, because you're expecting somebody else to do the work

[13:09] <mst> either you play nice with what's already there, or you put the work in to build something else

[13:09] <jdv79> it may not be possible but 2nd class is still bettervthan no class.

[13:09] <ShimmerFairy> mst: proposing equality is not at all like proposing a flipping of the tables.

[13:10] <mst> you're not listening

[13:10] <ShimmerFairy> I just don't want Perl 6 support to be stuffed into whatever corner of CPAN it can get crammed into, that's all.

[13:10] <mst> proposing "equality" when the work to support perl5 has already been done and you're expecting other people to do the work to support perl6

[13:10] <mst> is not constructive

[13:10] <DrForr> "some things are more equal than others."

[13:11] <ShimmerFairy> nine: do you think the existing cpan website would show P6 stuff too, or would separate site(s) be better?

[13:11] <nine> With ShimmerFairy already being on the defense, I suggest letting this discussion rest for now.

[13:11] <mst> entitled children are no fun anyway

[13:11] <mst> ShimmerFairy: *PLONK*

[13:11] <nine> ShimmerFairy: in my world, CPAN would show Perl modules.

[13:11] <RabidGravy> at some point some one who cares enough will make something happen

[13:12] <ShimmerFairy> mst: Insisting that I have to personally do all the work just to have the privilege to suggest things is very poisonous

[13:13] *** rmgk_ joined
[13:13] *** rmgk_ is now known as rmgk

[13:13] <jdv79> so glad i brought this up.

[13:13] <ShimmerFairy> nine: yeah, I wonder what it would look like to retool cpan and metacpan to let you browse both languages, as well as what it would take to retool modules.perl6.org (though that could just be a portal to CPAN if those sites get retooled)

[13:15] <nine> ShimmerFairy: the problem becomes much smaller once you think of it in terms of one language

[13:15] <ShimmerFairy> jdv79: I hope don't feel bad about it :) I admit I was being combative for a bit, I've noticed lately I tend to start out like that when I discover I'm the only one with my view on things.

[13:15] <pmurias> mst: re combative I think that's a really small majority

[13:16] <pmurias> * combative attitude to perl5/perl6

[13:16] * lizmat is back from sightseeing

[13:16] <lizmat> will backlog before reacting to anything :-)

[13:17] <mst> pmurias: yes. I was really surprised to see somebody doing that

[13:17] <mst> everybody else has grown up already

[13:17] <ShimmerFairy> nine: sure, if you allow for the C/C++ analogy (of which I make use of C++ only as well, appropriately), then of course C and C++ can and should intermingle as much as feasible. I just happen to be someone who codes in only C++, so I don't tend to see the C side of stuff.

[13:17] <mst> five or so years ago it was rather more of a problem

[13:17] <jdv79> i am justba bit concerned we've not got past the whole 5 6 hostility thing:(

[13:17] <jdv79> i hoped that was wellbbehind us

[13:18] <ShimmerFairy> jdv79: in reality I think it would be a good thing for 5 and 6 to get more friendly. I just happen to have no use for 5, so my opinions tend to be heavily 6-based :)

[13:18] <mst> the refusal to let the two languages have their own names means it never well be

[13:18] <RabidGravy> well right now there are 361 P6 modules by 87 distinct authors in the perl 6 ecosystem, not really sure how much further the current mechanism will scale

[13:18] <mst> but, OTOH, we can get pretty close without

[13:18] <DrForr> Shrug, that's why I'm writing p5-6 bridges, hoping to get more people at least interested.

[13:18] <nine> jdv79: I stopped fighting my brother and found him to be one of the most awesome persons I know when I was about 17. So maybe it'll take a year or two more ;)

[13:18] <mst> basically, occasionally you get some foolish child who starts blaming the other 'side' for not magically inventing extra volunteers

[13:18] <mst> then you stomp on it

[13:19] <mst> then you move on

[13:19] <ShimmerFairy> RabidGravy: of course, if we stuck with panda I can't imagine keeping it to the ecosystem repo

[13:19] <ShimmerFairy> mst: I hope you're still not insinuating that I specifically am a child.

[13:19] *** lizmat left
[13:20] <RabidGravy> but it will annoy someone at some point and someone will do something and at that point someone will consider the options for bringing P6 and P5 modules under one fold

[13:20] * leont isn't sure why p6 on CPAN is supposed to make sense. He does think a CPAN inspired system would be a terribly good idea.

[13:20] <dalek> rakudo/glr: 67e9f32 | (Stefan Seifert)++ | src/core/Hash.pm:

[13:20] <dalek> rakudo/glr: Fix positional support in hash('foo', 1) Hash constructor

[13:20] <dalek> rakudo/glr: review: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/67e9f32fb1

[13:20] <nine> 254/1047 spec test files failing

[13:20] <tadzik> leont: can we figure out a list of things that CPAN does either wrong or not fitting to Perl 6 that we want changed?

[13:21] <leont> I mean, CPAN is essentially little more than an indexer and a distribution system. The indexer can't be shared, and the distribution system is easily copied.

[13:21] <mst> right

[13:21] <mst> I think 'piggyback on the distribution stuff temporarily' isn't a bad plan

[13:21] <mst> and eventually you'll end up with your own indexer

[13:21] <mst> and at some point you can pick a new distribution system

[13:21] <nine> leont: I don't see anything about metacpan.org that I don't want for Perl 6

[13:21] <mst> will work fine

[13:21] <jdv79> no. its testers and search also at least

[13:22] <jdv79> plus other more minor aspects

[13:22] <leont> nine: metacpan is a layer on top of CPAN, it's not tied to the core of it at all

[13:22] *** lizmat joined
[13:23] <leont> tadzik: when doing things over, I'd make the index a dynamic one (e.g. webservice based), instead of the current set of files

[13:23] <mst> there's a difference between cpan-the-thing and cpan-the-ecosystem

[13:23] <jdv79> i was talking eco

[13:23] <tadzik> leont: will you be at SPW next week?

[13:24] <jdv79> the thing isnt as valuable

[13:24] <jdv79> obviously

[13:24] <leont> No, I won't even be online next week

[13:24] <leont> Some of the ecosystem can probably easily be adapted to perl6. CPAN-Testers is ultimately a fancy value-storage engine. If you write a Perl6 smoker you can probably easily reuse the centralized bits..

[13:25] <jdv79> YES

[13:25] <leont> It might need some adaptation (wrt namespacing p5 and p6 separately), but other than thatÖ

[13:25] <jdv79> maybe we should assemble all the past discussions

[13:26] <nine> m: my $hashref = {:a(1), :b(2), :c(3)}; my %h; %h = $hashref; say %h.perl;

[13:26] <camelia> rakudo-moar 375435: OUTPUT¬´Odd number of elements found where hash initializer expected‚ê§  in block <unit> at /tmp/NKuKiMTev9:1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[13:26] <GLRelia> rakudo-moar fde07e: OUTPUT¬´{:a(1), :b(2), :c(3)}‚ê§¬ª

[13:26] <lizmat> leont: the *big* difference is that Perl 6 has multiple backends

[13:26] <lizmat> so this multiplies times the number of OS's 

[13:26] <jdv79> thatvcan just be folded into platform dimension, right?

[13:26] <leont> I don't know metabase well, I suspect the main changes would be on the web-facing side of it

[13:26] <RabidGravy> the http://cpan.io/ref/cpan/history.html might help to focus on the how and why CPAN got like it is right now

[13:27] <ShimmerFairy> lizmat: do you have an on-hand link to a list of how P6 support on CPAN was planned? IIRC It was a specific subdir you had to put stuff in, but that's about it.

[13:27] <mst> metabase is basically a joke anyway

[13:27] <mst> it's some weird recursive mongodb storage that got prematurely generalised

[13:27] <mst> so long as you don't breathe hard on it, it probably won't break

[13:27] <RabidGravy> :)

[13:27] <lizmat> ShimmerFairy: if a distribution contains the file META6.info (or .json, I might have that wrong in my memory)

[13:27] <mst> but it's a fragile implementation of an incredibly silly design

[13:28] <lizmat> PAUSE will put that distribution into a possibly newly created Perl6 subdirectory

[13:28] <lizmat> the distrubution will *not* be indexed for Perl 5

[13:28] <jdv79> really? work has already been done?

[13:29] <lizmat> yes, that has been done

[13:29] <ShimmerFairy> lizmat: as I recall it was the forced subdir that I didn't like, even though it is just a stinkin' subdir :)  (and if PAUSE can detect a P6 module from P5, why can't the rest do the same? :P)

[13:29] <RabidGravy> sounds perfectly reasonable as something to get it started

[13:29] <lizmat> the delay is *really* on the Perl 6 side

[13:29] <jdv79> thats fantastic!

[13:29] <nine> 253 to go...

[13:29] <lizmat> the problem is really on the Perl 6 side, getting CURLI to work as specced

[13:29] <jdv79> ah...

[13:29] <lizmat> I hope we can nail that at the SPW Perl 6 hackathon

[13:30] <ShimmerFairy> I wonder if panda should be retooled to work off CPAN, as long as it's getting upgraded to GLR anyway... :)

[13:30] * ShimmerFairy looks up CURLI

[13:30] <jdv79> the path is set

[13:30] <jdv79> very nice

[13:30] <lizmat> ShimmerFairy: panda should become a client of CURLI.install

[13:30] <lizmat> and CURLI.install should Do All The Right Things(TM)

[13:31] <jdv79> i found the cur stuff under specced

[13:31] <jdv79> is there more info somewhere else?  

[13:31] <leont> Where can I find thsi CURLI?

[13:31] <lizmat> jdv79: CompUnitRepo::Local::Installation

[13:31] <jdv79> for example how is a remote cur supposed to work

[13:31] <lizmat> the P6 equivalent of the installed modules list of P5

[13:31] <jdv79> no.  remote.

[13:32] <leont> Ah

[13:32] <lizmat> sorry, was an answer to ShimmerFairy 

[13:32] <jdv79> the totality of the design space

[13:32] <lizmat> leont

[13:32] <lizmat> *sigh*

[13:32] <nine> ShimmerFairy: there's not much to change in panda for GLR. Mostly a couple of "flat"s here and there.

[13:32] <leont> Panda needs more work, unless it changed since last time I looked at it

[13:32] <ShimmerFairy> lizmat: ah, an abbreviation of a P6 term (I thought it was a P5/CPAN thing). I'll add it to S99 if you don't beat me to it :P

[13:32] <jdv79> oh.  sorry.

[13:32] <leont> Its extensibility is kind of sucky IMO

[13:32] <ShimmerFairy> nine: I figured, but as long as people are already working on it... :)

[13:32] <lizmat> ShimmerFairy: I'm pretty beat being out there in the 33C heat for most of the afternoon / evening

[13:33] <lizmat> it's going to be a cold night here in Tokyo, with lows of 26C   :-)

[13:33] <ShimmerFairy> lizmat: eee, sounds unfun (not a fan of warm weather myself)

[13:33] <RabidGravy> shocking

[13:33] <jdv79> its 33c here too in istanbil

[13:33] <nine> ShimmerFairy: as I'm currently the only one working on panda/glr I won't take on any extra work ;) Especially since I haven't done anything for my YAPC talk in a week...

[13:33] <jdv79> killing me, really

[13:34] <lizmat> jdv79: know the feeling :-(

[13:34] <RabidGravy> actually quite chilly in London :-\

[13:34] <lizmat> yeah, in NL we had a record cold for August as well

[13:34] <lizmat> 15C max for August is pretty unheard of

[13:35] <nine> lizmat: last time I was in Japan, I met an 86 year old Japanese. He spends two months every year on Hawaii, because he just can't stand the hot and humid Japanese summers :)

[13:35] <lizmat> and lots and lots of rain: I wonder how long it will take before people realize we're going to have a monsoon season in NL in the future

[13:35] <lizmat> nine: sounds like a smart guy

[13:40] <DrForr> I'm sure it'll speed up. Shrug.

[13:40] <RabidGravy> I think it's something that's more likely to actually happen after more people start using P6 and the current arrangments for the ecosystem become unmanageable

[13:41] <jdv79> huh. ok.

[13:41] <ShimmerFairy> I think so too, but on the other hand it'd be nice if panda+ecosystem didn't blow up before we made it all work.

[13:54] <nine> smls: well I'd say bringing back (1, 2, 3) === (1, 2, 3) is above my pay grade :) No idea how even to begin trying to do that. For now I just change tests that are actually not concerned with this particular feature, but are testing something else and should be content with eqv.

[13:54] <smls> nine: Understood.

[13:56] <lizmat> nine smls : I don't think they can ever be the same, as the containers can be changed, so it is not a value based object

[13:56] <smls> the *contents* of child containers can change

[13:57] <smls> but both would still have the same container as child

[13:57] <smls> hence "shallow" immutability

[13:57] <nine> lizmat: then I will bow to your understanding of these things and happily continue replacing === with eqv when I'm sure it's ok :)

[13:58] <lizmat> nine++  :-)

[14:00] <b2gills> ShimmerFairy: When working with Perl 5, if the code isn't on CPAN it doesn't exist. Also I like that getting an account isn't automated, it helps prevent drive-by uploads that don't follow the guidelines, and having many uploads with slight variations ( I think I read this is a problem with Ruby Gems ).

[14:00] <nine> tadzik: if that was before yesterday, you're long out of date ;)

[14:01] <tadzik> nine: I think it was yesterday :P You now have a commit bit

[14:01] <lizmat> m: my $a = (1,2,3); my $b = $a; $b[2] = 4; say $a === $b

[14:01] <lizmat> if they *are* immutable Int's then List.WHICH should reflect so

[14:01] <lizmat> which would fix ===

[14:01] <ShimmerFairy> b2gills: fair enough on the CPAN being the only place where stuff exists, but I still think manual account creation is a very antiquated-looking thing :)

[14:02] <lizmat> ShimmerFairy: that's because it's 20+ years old :-)

[14:02] <leont> In practice, the manual account creation is not that much of an issue

[14:02] <RabidGravy> b2gills, it definitely is a problem with npm.js

[14:03] <leont> The bar to upload something is still really low, as is proven my certain people

[14:03] <ShimmerFairy> lizmat: yes, and PAUSE's web (not-)design reflects that best :P

[14:03] <nine> tadzik: thanks! pushed

[14:03] *** rindolf left
[14:03] <leont> TBH, I rarely use PAUSE's web-interface anymore CPAN::Uploader/cpan-upload is useful like that

[14:05] <smls> ^^ lizmat: Set/Mag/Mix also happily accept mutable child elements, without breaking ===

[14:05] <smls> List could do the same

[14:06] <lizmat> smls: could you show me an example of that ?

[14:06] <smls> === on the set simply checks === on the children

[14:06] <smls> and === vor mutable types, does object identity

[14:07] <lizmat> no, it does an eq on the .WHICH

[14:07] <RabidGravy> I've only got three more P6 modules until I've got more than I have on CPAN

[14:07] <lizmat> (currently)

[14:08] <lizmat> and the .WHICH of a set is a concatenation of all the .WHICHes of the elements

[14:08] <smls> lizmat: Doesn't the example I gave show it?

[14:08] <lizmat> which is sub-optimal, but there you go

[14:08] <lizmat> RabidGravy++

[14:08] <RabidGravy> or maybe I should just delete Linux::Svgalib from CPAN as I'm pretty sure it doesn't work any more

[14:08] <RabidGravy> ;-)

[14:08] * leont should add more of his modules to the ecosystem, even if the others are currently fairly minor

[14:09] <RabidGravy> the more the merrier leont :)

[14:10] <smls> lizmat: Those are implementation details :P

[14:11] <smls> The gist is that Set's are immutable, and if two sets have the same elements as defined by ===, the sets themselves compare positively with ===.

[14:12] <lizmat> smls: ok, :-)

[14:12] <smls> And I was under the impression that like pre-GLR Parcel, post-GLR List should be like that too.

[14:13] <smls> Thus, my surprise at nine++'s commits message... :P

[14:14] <smls> Though only jnthn and TimToady will know for sure, what post-GLR List is supposed to be like... ;)

[14:25] <laben> if panda could get modules from CPAN, we would need a Perl6 module to upload there and a good part of the work would be done :)

[14:26] *** davercc`` joined
[14:26] <laben> meanwhile can i ask you to think of the distro packagers, please don't make their work harder than it needs to be

[14:28] * leont is using @fooª.bar a lot as short hand for @foo.map(*.bar), even when I don't care about it being hyper. Is there any reason why this is a bad idea? I understand that post-glr the performance cost is minimal

[14:28] <leont> At least in single thread, but I'm not sure it really pays off in multi when the method is essentially an accessor

[14:29] <lizmat> leont: for small @foo in hot loops, >>.'s overhead (estimated at about 5%) might be an issue

[14:29] <laben> leont: can you make sure you're single threaded? otherwise the results order is not assured to be the same as input order, as with .map

[14:30] <lizmat> otherwise, on multi-core machines, I don't think there's any other theoretical drawback

[14:30] <ShimmerFairy> leont: ¬ª doesn't guarantee evaluation order (it's currently scrambled specifically to discourage this when it becomes more problematic), and if the method you're hyper-ing can't handle being multi-threaded (for whatever reason), there's another reason not to use ¬ª

[14:30] <lizmat> laben:  >> ensures same order at the end

[14:30] *** zakharyas left
[14:30] <leont> ShimmerFairy: I know, but they're accessors, so that shouldn't be an issue. It's more than I'm not actively trying to distribute the work over multiple cores, as the method should be fast

[15:35] <[Coke]> isBEKaml: I tried to re-enable the pugs line, but cabal isn't available on hack, and I didn't figure out how to install it yet.

[15:36] <isBEKaml> [Coke]: ah, who admins hack?

[15:36] * [Coke] sheepishly raises his hand.

[15:36] <[Coke]> i have sudo, anyway.

[15:36] <isBEKaml> hehheh

[15:37] <timotimo> me, too *cough*

[15:37] <timotimo> that's documented in the infrastructure docs repository on github

[15:37] <isBEKaml> perhaps I can help?

[15:37] * [Coke] guesses "apt-get install <mumble>", and pokes.

[15:37] <moritz> cabal-install maybe

[15:38] <isBEKaml> apt-get install cabal-install #guesses

[15:38] * moritz does so

[15:38] <moritz> there's now a 'cabal' binary on hack.

[15:38] <isBEKaml> moritz: now, you'd also need stack

[15:39] <nine> I'm afk for a while, teaching how to fly this baby: http://segelflieger-linz.at/static/1/7/8/118/image/OE-5502.jpg

[15:39] <moritz> isBEKaml: what's stack?

[15:39] <isBEKaml> moritz: https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/wiki/Downloads#debian

[15:40] *** telex left
[15:40] <isBEKaml> pug.hs readme also mentions it

[15:41] <moritz> they didn't seriously name a debian package "stack", did they?

[15:41] <isBEKaml> haskell-stack, I guess. 

[15:41] <isBEKaml> It should be available on testing or experimental repos

[15:41] <moritz> well, hack is Jessie, which is stable now

[15:42] <isBEKaml> *shrugs* I haven't used debian for a few years now

[15:42] <isBEKaml> It was etch when I was using it

[15:42] <[Coke]> pugs build dies with unrecognized option `--extra-prog-path=/home/coke/.cabal/bin'

[15:43] <isBEKaml> what's the cabal version?

[15:43] <[Coke]> oh. one thing I could totally do is setup a daily glr run.

[15:43] <moritz> seems I have to add that fpcomplete.com debian repo

[15:43] <[Coke]> cabal-install version 1.20.0.3

[15:43] <isBEKaml> 7.10 ships with 1.22, I think

[15:44] <[Coke]> "cabal-install is already the newest version."

[15:45] <moritz> ghc 7.6.3 is installe

[15:45] <moritz> d

[15:46] *** mr-foobar left
[15:47] *** chansen_ joined
[15:47] <isBEKaml> ok, pugs is known to build with 7.6+ too. 

[15:48] <[Coke]> known?

[15:48] <[Coke]> This is post-resurrection?

[15:48] <isBEKaml> yeah, it's mentioned somewhere in the repo. The only thing having a problem with it is windows (I raised an issue a while back -- not checked since)

[15:48] *** mr-foobar joined
[15:49] <[Coke]> (while back) it's been broken for a while back.

[15:49] <isBEKaml> I know. Somebody was good enough to fix them all, thanks to stack

[15:50] *** mr-foobar left
[15:50] *** mr-foobar joined
[15:51] <isBEKaml> let me try building it here, without using stack. I got ghc 7.8

[16:00] <[Coke]> not me, but sure.

[16:01] <laben> i was just reading that and considering, how useful would it be to make it into asingle test

[16:02] <laben> a single test file

[16:05] <RabidGravy> well a big list of naughty javascript strings

[16:06] <laben> the unicode ones could make for a good test for Unicode normalization

[16:07] <RabidGravy> It might make a good test for a json parser too

[17:03] <laben> does a table of NQP types exist?

[17:03] <arnsholt> Don't think so

[17:04] <arnsholt> What kind of types are you looking for?

[17:04] <laben> trying to debug an object i get when calling .signature on a candidate method

[17:05] <laben> it's not-null, concrete, not Signature, not Code, not Block, .... not Hash, not LIst, not anything i could think of

[17:05] <arnsholt> What about Capture?

[17:05] <laben> is it a type?

[17:06] <arnsholt> Until GLR lands, sure

[18:56] <vendethiel> pyrimidine: yeah, I can see that. I'm not a perl5 guy, so I can't really say

[18:56] <moritz> _itz_: the double response for nqp* targets for example is a bit redundant

[18:59] <_itz_> moritz: thanks for the feedback. I'll hack the code about a bit tomorrow

[19:00] <vendethiel> [Coke]: do you have any good coldfusion learning ressources?

[19:00] <nine> Another 5 character GLR fail ;)

[19:04] <[Coke]> vendethiel: nope, just years of annoying, hands on experience.

[19:04] <[Coke]> happy to answer questions off channel if you ahve something specific.

[19:06] <vendethiel> no, i'm just always up to learn the basics of another language :)

[19:13] <[Coke]> the scripting is an afterthought which gets slightly better each release, as more tag-based stuff is made available. variable scoping is evil, whitespace output is evil, everything is case insensitive except when it's not...

[19:14] <[Coke]> (e.g. you can not declare a variable in a method... in an object... that can be invoked multiple times across multiple requests, and isn't thread safe. and that's the -default-.

[19:15] <vendethiel> uhm. seems confusing alright :) thanks

[19:16] <flussence> sounds like php :D

[19:17] <nine> probably worse though

[19:17] <flussence> well, true, php doesn't have thread safety to worry about...

[19:36] <_itz_> it understands both atom and rss

[19:37] <skids> nine: that looks like a "single item rule" thing.

[19:37] <smls> ok

[19:38] <nine> skids: thanks. I think, I can just use the standard idiom for handling that

[19:42] <laben> pyrimidine: does the majority of p5'ers think that way about p6? that would be quite disheartening :-(

[20:19] <nine> ugexe: but you didn't use gimme directly. Some other core code still does and has to be refactored. Using >> is still fine.

[20:20] <ugexe> bin/scripts can be busted in the mean time or it can use .map. I didn't think it was a controversial choice

[20:41] <nine> oh, GLRelia is up to date :)

[20:41] <smls> Heh. I guess it's because the ... op doesn't care what its LHS is (except in the case of numbere) and just calls .succ until it reaches the target?
