[00:33] <dpk> is it possible to implement parsers for Python-style indentation-sensitive recursive syntaxes with Perl 6 rules?

[00:34] <dpk> without needing an initial tokenization stage or input preprocessing

[00:34] <dpk> pure PEGs (and CFGs in general) cannot do this

[00:34] <dpk> but looking at Perl 6's possibilities with code assertions and closures it seems it *should* be possible …

[00:56] <tony-o_> dpk: you can implement a grammar that surrounds anything indented more than the previous line with { }

[01:13] <tony-o_> then in your source all you'd need is use PyPerl; or whatever you call it

[01:40] <rjbs> hoelzro: converted a bunch of code to Buf.push!  One weird case, going to try to sort that out now.

[01:44] <rjbs> how up to date is "m:"'s build?

[01:45] <rjbs> m: my $b = Buf.new; $b.push(1)

[01:45] <camelia> rakudo-moar c2a57e: OUTPUT«Cannot call push(Buf: Int); none of these signatures match:␤    (Any:U \SELF: *@values, *%_)␤  in block <unit> at /tmp/lO1erViuT4:1␤␤»

[01:45] <rjbs> Not up to date neough. :-)

[01:45] <rjbs> Why does this happen?

[01:45] <rjbs> ~$ perl6 -e 'my $b = Buf.new; $b.push(1 xx 1)'

[01:45] <rjbs> Method 'shift' not found for invocant of class 'Parcel'

[01:46] <rjbs> I'm guessing because of this in Buf.pm: +        nqp::push_i(@splicees, @values.shift) while @values;

[01:46] *** panchiniak left
[01:46] <rjbs> This smells like failure: my $b = Buf.new; $b.push( (1 xx 1).list )

[03:25] <vendethiel> dpk: yes

[03:25] <vendethiel> dpk: that's what I did with https://github.com/vendethiel/Nephrite.pl/blob/master/lib/Text/Nephrite/Grammar.pm, based on masak++'s blog post

[03:29] <dpk> hmm, interesting. can it handle arbitrary/mixed indentation styles? e.g. it doesn't force you to use tabs or two or four spaces, and you can use e.g. two spaces at one level and four at another?

[03:30] * dpk reads also https://github.com/masak/text-indented/blob/master/lib/Text/Indented.pm

[03:30] <vendethiel> it does!

[03:30] <tony-o_> dpk: you can build it however you want!

[03:30] <vendethiel> but just looking for initial space is easy

[03:30] <tony-o_> the actions is the harder part but still doable

[03:31] <dpk> http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/parsing-indented-text is the post you mean, i assume

[03:32] <tadzik> ingy: ^^ this is relevant to your interests

[03:33] <dpk> "But there are some indent jumps that we're not allowed to make. Anything that indents more than one step at a time, basically." — this implies that there's a predetermined size to 'steps'

[03:34] <vendethiel> in this post, yes.

[03:34] <dpk> indeed, that blog post looks like it implements a parser makes you use 4 spaces

[03:35] <vendethiel> but really, $baseIndent ~~ /^(\s+)/; should work to detect it

[03:36] * dpk also looks at https://github.com/arnsholt/snake/

[03:36] <tadzik> I like.to.think that I follow masak++ blog, but it seems like every day someone posts something cool that I have not read yet :)

[03:37] <tadzik> Ohh, a cool new post! Wait, 2014?

[03:37] <dpk> hmph, https://github.com/arnsholt/snake/blob/master/src/Snake/Grammar.nqp tokenizes first (unsurprising, since that's what the Python specification says to do)

[03:38] <dpk> https://github.com/arnsholt/snake/blob/master/src/Snake/Grammar.nqp#L175 is relevant nonetheless

[03:43] <dpk> it's rapidly becoming clear that i don't at all understand how closure state is managed while parsing with grammars

[14:44] <llfourn> hey I was just messing around with opreator overloading -- I was wondering if it's possible to add an infix operator that worked like '.'. Eg $obj->method instead of $obj.method

[14:44] <llfourn> I can do $obj->"method" but ofc I get error without the ""

[14:45] <llfourn> using a multi sub infix

[14:46] *** skids joined
[14:46] *** raiph left
[14:51] <timotimo> right, . is not really an operator, because the RHS isn't a "thing"

[14:51] <timotimo> it's not an expression, that is

[14:52] <timotimo> so you'll have to build a slang instead of just adding an operator

[15:00] <timotimo> froggs' v5 has been properly slangified a few months ago and we have a simple SQL slang and Tuxic, which allows [Tux] to adhere to his coding style properly

[15:00] <timotimo> i think Piersing is a very simple slang that might serve as a good example, no?

[15:01] *** itz joined
[15:01] <timotimo> um ... wait what

[15:01] * grondilu has no idea what Piersing is.

[15:01] <timotimo> allows ? and ! at the end of identifiers

[15:01] <timotimo> froggs forgot to put "Piersing" back into the code when he copy-pasted it from Tuxic

[15:01] <timotimo> https://github.com/FROGGS/p6-Slang-Piersing/commit/d78041daee398ec5f3beb32a615eafa72689c14e

[15:01] * grondilu notices the link above https://github.com/FROGGS/p6-Slang-Piersing/

[15:02] * grondilu checks it out

[15:02] <timotimo> https://github.com/FROGGS/p6-Slang-Piersing/pull/1 :)

[15:03] <grondilu> so nqp code is required, apparently.

[15:03] <timotimo> no, just nqp ops

[15:03] *** pecastro left
[15:03] <grondilu> well, that qualifies at nqp code in my book

[15:03] <timotimo> though "use nqp" kind of sounds like "use the nqp slang" or "this is nqp code"

[15:04] <timotimo> i respectfully disagree

[15:04] <timotimo> but then i come at this with a guts-programmer mindset

[15:04] <grondilu> will it always be necessary to invoke nqp ops to define slangs?

[15:04] <moritz> I hope not

[15:05] <grondilu> then that's what I meant when I wrote that I thought rakudo was not quite ready for slangs.

[15:05] <moritz> in the past, we've provided a way to avoid nqp:: ops in the MOP by having Perl6::Metamodel::Primitives

[15:05] <moritz> maybe we need the same for Perl6::Compiler::Primitives or so

[15:06] <hoelzro> japhb: thanks for pointing that out, fixed!

[15:08] <timotimo> i don't remember the primitives thing

[15:08] <timotimo> where can i find that?

[15:16] <moritz> if there's no reaction, or a negative reaction, we can clone into the perl6-community-modules org

[15:17] <hoelzro> moritz: the PRs should send jpve an email, right? I figure we can clone if they PRs aren't addressed for quite some time

[15:17] <hoelzro> maybe another few months

[15:20] <timotimo> the PRs will only send an email if it's not deactivated in the account, or the repository is muted ... can you mute your own repositories?

[15:20] <hoelzro> ah, good point

[15:20] <hoelzro> timotimo: I think you unwatch it

[15:21] <moritz> and a mail from a human asking about several pull requests is quite a different thing than a few automated mails

[15:22] <timotimo> aye

[15:22] <timotimo> on the other hand, mails that are automated, but made to look like they're from a person ... those are aggravating :S

[15:24] <JimmyZ> hoelzro: any reason why not https://github.com/MoarVM/linenoise?

[15:25] <hoelzro> JimmyZ: ignorance of the existence of that repo, mainly =)

[15:25] <JimmyZ> hoelzro: which supports windows :)

[15:25] <JimmyZ> ha

[15:28] <timotimo> but MoarVM/linenoise is just a fork of the upstream linenoise repository with a tiny amount of patches, if any

[15:28] <timotimo> AFK for a bit

[15:30] <llfourn> can I do something like 'use STD' so I can do STD.parse( 'my $foo = "bar"' ) 

[15:30] <llfourn> for STD.p6

[15:31] <llfourn> STD.pm6*

[15:31] <llfourn> im trying to sort of figure out what it calls each of the things so I can make a slang

[15:33] <hoelzro> it's quite difficult to find this guy's e-mail

[15:34] <JimmyZ> timotimo: yeah, for supporting windows 

[15:34] <hoelzro> this is making me wish GH hadn't gotten rid of messaging =/

[16:05] <hoelzro> ok, just reproduced it on 2015.05 =o_O

[16:06] <hoelzro> it just didn't happen with rakudobrew'd 2015.05?

[16:06] <hoelzro> this is getting weird

[16:07] *** kaare_ joined
[16:11] <AlexDaniel> Hm, I'm wondering: if you can change perl6 syntax so easily, how the hell text editors are supposed to do syntax highlighting and other stuff?

[16:11] <llfourn> ==> Successfully installed JSON::Tiny with my rakudobrew 2015.05

[16:12] *** vendethiel joined
[16:12] <timotimo> AlexDaniel: there's always the problem of trust, but the syntax highlighter could use a perl6 grammar and load the slang as well; sounds very flaky, though, doesn't it?

[16:13] <llfourn> speaking of loading the perl6 grammar -- can you actually do that atm with rakudo? ie use Perl6::Grammar; Perl6::Grammar.parse(...)

[16:14] <llfourn> I've been trying to figure this out for last 20 mins :)

[16:14] *** araujo left
[16:18] <moritz> I don't think it's possible (or easy)

[16:19] <moritz> https://github.com/cedric-vincent/kains/blob/master/META.info is it normal/correct to not have a 'source-url' or 'repo-url', but rather a 'support'/'url'?

[16:20] *** cognominal joined
[16:20] *** dwarring left
[16:20] <timotimo> you can nqp::getcomp('Perl6').parse( ... )

[16:20] <timotimo> with getcomp you get the Perl6::Compiler object

[16:21] <llfourn> moritz: hmm shame -- i thought my Mu $MAIN-grammar := nqp::atkey(%*LANG, 'MAIN'); make give aceess to it

[16:21] <timotimo> hm, it might

[16:22] <llfourn> nqp::getcomp('Perl6').parse( 'my $a = "foo";' ); Cannot call method 'parse' on a null object

[16:22] *** kaare__ joined
[16:23] <moritz> try it with lower case?

[16:23] <moritz> llfourn: I don't know to which degree the grammar depends on the actions being there

[16:23] <moritz> m: use nqp; nqp::getcomp('perl6').parse( 'my $a = "foo";' );

[16:23] <camelia> rakudo-moar c2a57e: ( no output )

[16:26] <llfourn> cool thanks. I wonder how easy NQPMatch can be used.

[16:28] *** FROGGS joined
[16:29] <llfourn> not easily I guess. Ok I'll scratch the parse perl6 with perl6 to figure out what tokens to override to make a slang.

[16:29] <llfourn> for now :)

[16:36] <hoelzro> ok, this is just wacky

[16:37] <hoelzro> rakudobuild build moar nom and panda install JSON::Tiny works

[16:40] *** gfldex left

[16:40] <llfourn> tony-o_: I was simply trying to add -> operator which to start off with was just going to be the same as '.' method call

[16:41] <tony-o_> add that operator to what?

[16:41] <tony-o_> or to mean what?

[16:41] <llfourn> like $obj->method as well as $obj.method

[16:41] <tony-o_> ah!, that should be fun :-)

[16:41] <llfourn> I hope so :)

[16:42] <tony-o_> there are a couples slangs out there now that can be used as examples

[16:42] <tony-o_> slang::tuxic 

[16:42] <tony-o_> slang::sql

[16:43] <tony-o_> slang::piersing is out there now too, not sure what the source for that one looks like

[16:43] <llfourn> https://github.com/FROGGS/p6-Slang-Piersing/blob/master/lib/Slang/Piersing.pm

[16:45] <tony-o_> yea i mean i haven't studied it, i wrote slang-sql, i read slang-tuxic quite a bit

[16:45] <llfourn> hmmm thanks

[16:45] <llfourn> yeah methodop might be the one I need to look at

[16:50] *** brrt left
[16:50] <llfourn> wait... maybe I can just do autoload so $obj->meth doesn't give undecl routine and just return string from there
