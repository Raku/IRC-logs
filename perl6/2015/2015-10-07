[00:29] *** laouji joined
[00:29] <konobi> tried `brew options <perl6?>` ?

[00:29] *** TingPing joined
[00:30] <pfhork> I think I used OS X provided perl to run http://perlbrew.pl/ and got man pages. ymmv

[00:30] *** muraiki joined
[00:30] <mst> and then there's rakudobrew for installing rakudo

[00:30] <timotimo> i'm not even sure rakudo has a man page

[00:31] <perlboy_> yeah I 'brew install raduko-star' - no man option

[00:36] <johnjohn101> hi perl6 peeps

[00:36] <johnjohn101> what's the word?

[00:36] <perlboy_> Hm seems canonical(?) Perl6 documentation is on GitHub: https://github.com/perl6/doc

[00:36] *** Idiosyncrat joined
[00:37] <johnjohn101> perl 6 will be "out" EOY?  what will be available?

[00:37] *** coetry joined
[00:37] <TimToady> perlboy_: doc.perl6.org

[00:37] <timotimo> bird's the word! :)

[00:38] <coetry> TimToady, are you seriously Mr. Larry?

[00:38] <johnjohn101> so perl6 will use the java engine? or will it be parrot?

[00:38] <TimToady> johnjohn101: yes, more or less what works now

[00:38] *** dbenton joined
[00:38] <TimToady> moar and maybe java

[00:38] <timotimo> coetry: he's not always very serious

[00:39] <johnjohn101> TimToady: so download rakudo?

[00:39] <Idiosyncrat> Just dropped in to say congratulations on the announcement.

[00:39] *** laouji left
[00:39] <timotimo> johnjohn101: we've not been developing against parrot for multiple months now

[00:39] <coetry> TimToady, congratulations sir, you are an inspiration. I look forward to joining the perl community

[00:39] * TimToady bows

[00:39] <johnjohn101> timotimo: i see

[00:39] *** mattprelude left
[00:39] <timotimo> johnjohn101: the release will likely be on JVM; it will be on MoarVM guaranteed

[00:39] *** laouji joined
[00:40] <Idiosyncrat> I was at the Monterey convention where the Perl 6 decision was made, though not "in the room"

[00:40] * TimToady tried to show forest-fire running on JVM last night, but it blew up on the signal handler :)

[00:40] <Idiosyncrat> Which is OK because I'm not good at dodging coffee cups.

[00:40] <johnjohn101> timotimo: interesting. 

[00:40] *** rurban joined
[00:41] *** alpha- left
[00:42] <Idiosyncrat> I'm pleased to hear that Perl 6 includes Lua.

[00:42] <Idiosyncrat> Which version? 5.1? 5.2?

[00:43] <muraiki> Idiosyncrat: https://github.com/raydiak/Inline-Lua/

[00:43] <timotimo> "includes" lua?

[00:43] <timotimo> ah, that

[00:43] <TimToady> it doesn't include Lua, but there's a start on an Inline::Lua module

[00:43] <Idiosyncrat> muraiki: thanks

[00:43] <timotimo> just like Inline::Perl5 and Inline::Python

[00:43] <timotimo> except the latter two are very advanced

[00:43] <TimToady> well, the Python one doesn't really do the 'inline' part yet

[00:44] <ShimmerFairy> Maybe they're referencing MoarVM's lua stuff as well? (I recall hearing luajit around mvm, at least)

[00:44] *** laouji left
[00:44] <TimToady> still have to use the object there

[00:44] *** laouji joined
[00:44] <Idiosyncrat> OK.  Says 5.1 and Luajit compatible, which is good because that's exactly the choice we made for Marpa

[00:44] <timotimo> there's a minilua in MoarVM's build system

[00:44] <TimToady> it uses luajit, yes, though I don't know if that will continue

[00:44] <TimToady> once we get our own superjit, which has been in the works all summer

[00:45] <timotimo> oh

[00:45] <timotimo> we're not using "luajit", we use "dynasm", which is what luajit uses

[00:45] <muraiki> I was hoping we'd go with lejit

[00:46] <muraiki> bad attempt at pun

[00:46] <TimToady> all attempts at pun are bad :P

[00:47] <BenGoldberg> That pun was illejit.

[00:47] <Idiosyncrat> He did manage to find a pun not already used as the name of a language.

[00:49] <Idiosyncrat> timotimo: minilua?

[00:50] <timotimo> yeah, just a tiny lua implementation we can use to run dynasm on our source

[00:50] <timotimo> only needed when you develop

[00:50] <timotimo> and only needed once during the build steps

[00:50] <Idiosyncrat> Lua is already pretty mini.

[00:50] *** laouji_ joined
[00:51] <Idiosyncrat> Did you drop language features?

[00:51] <timotimo> we didn't do anything :)

[00:51] <timotimo> https://github.com/LuaDist/luajit/blob/master/src/host/minilua.c - apparently minilua belongs to luajit?

[00:53] *** DaveFol joined
[00:54] *** tokuhirom joined
[00:54] <Idiosyncrat> Gotta wonder why you'd try to shrink Lua any further -- though Mike Pall is definitely a guy who knows what he's doing, so I guess there had to be a reason

[00:55] *** laouji_ left
[00:55] <boggard> i was going to jokingly ask when there would be an inline C module, but then i looked again at the modules directory and sure enough...

[01:03] <llfourn> o/ #perl6

[01:03] <llfourn> congrats on new site

[01:03] <llfourn> looks good

[01:04] <pink_mist> Zoffix++

[01:05] <llfourn> indeed!

[01:05] <fling> http://perl6.org/ ?

[01:05] * fling is on cdma, can't check atm :P

[01:06] <llfourn> yes it's new and bootstrappy

[01:06] <llfourn> but not too much

[01:08] <fling> hmm hmm.

[01:08] <rjbs> So, I have a Buf[uint8].

[01:08] *** chenryn_ joined
[01:09] <rjbs> Something is doing $buf1.push( $buf2.list )

[01:09] <rjbs> I get: This type cannot unbox to a native integer

[01:09] <rjbs> This used to work.  Any hot tips?

[01:10] <ShimmerFairy> try .append, if that's available on Buf

[01:11] <pfhork> I just realized I was in a Perl6 channel... I retract my mention of Perlbrew.

[01:11] *** sufrostico left
[01:12] <BenGoldberg> perlbrew

[01:12] <BenGoldberg> There aren't enough versions of perl6 yet for that to be worthwhile!

[01:12] <timotimo> rjbs: we probably have to implement append and prepend for buf

[01:12] <llfourn> rjbs: $buf1.push(|$buf2)?

[01:12] *** chenryn_ left
[01:12] *** nbiiebbiih joined
[01:13] <llfourn> i dunno much about native bufs but .list might not behave the same way after GLR

[01:13] *** shifty_ joined
[01:13] <timotimo> we may want a hundred more tests in the spec test suite for this

[01:14] <rjbs> timotimo: But it worked in June. :-/

[01:14] <rjbs> llfourn: That sounds like a guess.

[01:14] <rjbs> llfourn: I mean, a good guess!

[01:14] *** shifty_ left
[01:14] <llfourn> rjbs: it sure is a guess :D

[01:14] <ShimmerFairy> rjbs: .push was recently changed so that  $a.push($a.pop)  always ends up with the same list, with .append taking the place of "push a list"

[01:14] <mst> pfhork: I dunno, you can use perlbrew to get a decent perl, then rakudobrew to use that to build a perl6

[01:14] <rjbs> llfourn: It was a good guess.

[01:14] <timotimo> june is oooold :)

[01:14] <rjbs> Yeah, I knew some GLR stuff would affect this code.

[01:15] <pfhork> Dropped in perl6 to ask this Question: If /. says last night Larry said perl6 is released as a development preview, why is there nothing about that on perl6.org the perl6-announce list ... is it (Christmas) a misunderstanding, or specific to some subpart of perl6?

[01:16] <rjbs> Next problem is:

[01:16] <rjbs> Cannot unbox a type object in any  at /Users/rjbs/.rakudobrew/moar-nom/install/share/nqp/lib/Perl6/Metamodel.moarvm:1 in block <unit> at t/basic.t:163

[01:17] <rjbs> That line is:   is-deeply( $zscii, Buf[uint16].new("Ameri\x[9D]ans".split('')>>.ord), "...and they're what we expect too",

[01:17] <timotimo> pfhork: is it already christmas?

[01:17] *** BenGoldberg left
[01:18] <timotimo> m: Buf[uint16].new("Ameri\x[9D]ans".split('')>>.ord)

[01:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 06edf9: OUTPUT¬´Cannot unbox a type object‚ê§  in any  at gen/moar/m-Metamodel.nqp:1670‚ê§  in block <unit> at /tmp/mfcMUJICOi:1‚ê§‚ê§¬ª

[01:18] <timotimo> m: say "Ameri\x[9D]ans".split('')>>.ord.perl

[01:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 06edf9: OUTPUT¬´(Int, 65, 109, 101, 114, 105, 157, 97, 110, 115, Int)‚ê§¬ª

[01:18] <timotimo> why use split('') and not comb?

[01:18] <rjbs> timotimo: probably ignorance

[01:18] <mst> pfhork: so far as I'm aware all that happened last night was larry gave a talk saying "probably this christmas", like he did at FOSDEM earlier etc.

[01:18] <rjbs> Do bugs have comb?

[01:18] <rjbs> bufs

[01:18] <timotimo> if the thing you're splitting with matches at the beginnign and/or end, you'll end up with '' at the beginning and end

[01:19] <ShimmerFairy> rjbs: no, afaik

[01:19] <rjbs> fixing

[01:26] <pfhork> Thanks; I ... guess it's not actually real big news then. Sorry my captive-portal wifi crapped out just after I asked.

[01:27] <llfourn> how do I find path of current source file? (ie FindBin)

[01:27] <timotimo> to be fair, we've been doing lots of releases for a long time

[01:27] <timotimo> but now we have 6.Birthday

[01:27] <timotimo> and soon we'll have 6.Christmas

[01:27] <mst> pfhork: larry gave a talk, somebody wrote a blog post with a suggestive title, lots of people then reported the title and not the content

[01:27] <mst> pfhork: welcome to the internet

[01:28] *** nuc_ joined
[01:28] *** nuc left
[01:29] <pfhork> Okay... thanks. I did check the log after reloading. So I guess it's what I suspected and not something more special. (not to detract from existing regular releases)

[01:29] <timotimo> to be fair, we have been looking forward to this time

[01:29] <timotimo> as the "first release we'll use the special 'ready' word for", or something like that

[01:29] <timotimo> because people have been bugging us like crazy about this s**t :)

[01:29] <timotimo> "but when will it be production ready?" - "well, what is 'production ready' for you?" - "oh you're just evading the question!1"

[01:30] <pfhork> It could be an opportunity for attention, better managed by calling it out on perl6.org.

[01:30] <timotimo> since we've been working on perl6.org recently anyway, perhaps we should put a blurb bout that there

[01:30] <pfhork> production is always a matter of "what makes you want to say that"

[01:30] *** roguelazer left
[01:31] <timotimo> that's what we say anyway, pfhork :)

[01:31] <timotimo> others aren't so interested in that

[01:31] <mst> don't worry, if you think it's annoying in here, you should see how annoying it is for the perl5 community

[01:31] <mst> "

[01:31] <mst> "why haven't you released a major version?"

[01:31] <mst> "we did, version 22 came out this year"

[01:31] *** [Sno] left
[01:31] <mst> "but but but perl6"

[01:31] <timotimo> oh god

[01:31] <mst> "that's a different language that is very cool but not the same thing"

[01:32] *** roguelazer joined
[01:32] <mst> "but WHY HAVEN'T YOU RELEASED A MJAOR VERSION"

[01:32] <mst> "*shoots user*"

[01:32] <mst> or "omg, you mean this is going to be python 2/3?"

[01:32] <mst> "no, they're TWO LANGUAGES. also we have interop both ways"

[01:32] <mst> "but but but"

[01:33] <mst> "*shoots user again*"

[01:34] * mst ponders writing a blog post titled "almost, but not entirely, quite unlike python 3"

[01:34] <ShimmerFairy> My preferred analogy is C and C++. Two different languages, it takes a little work to let the other language use your language's stuff ('extern "C"' et. al.), but they're undoubtedly connected :)

[01:34] <pfhork> Should it be explained like C & Obj-C or C & C++ or C & C# [I believe that's varying degrees of sibling-hood]

[01:35] <mst> I like C and C++ as an analogy

[01:35] *** laouji_ joined
[01:36] <mst> since in general I've been criticised and insulted about equally by perl5 and perl6 people for using it

[01:36] <ShimmerFairy> pfhork: like I just said, I've thought of it like C/C++ for quite a while :)

[01:36] <mst> which suggests it's probably right

[01:37] <ShimmerFairy> mst: I wouldn't know for sure, but I feel like python 2/3 isn't quite as good a comparison, because AFAIK 3 is still seen as the "next version" of Python.

[01:37] <mst> also C# is a java family language, so that makes no sense

[01:37] <mst> ShimmerFairy: uh. that's precisely my point.

[01:38] <ShimmerFairy> mst: oh, I'm afraid I misunderstood your point then. I thought you wanted to point out how neither is a direct successor of the other, kinda like C and C++ (where C++ isn't seen as the "next version" of C)

[01:38] <mst> I do

[01:38] <mst> that's why the python 2/3 comparison makes no sense at all

[01:39] <ShimmerFairy> mst: ah, so "precisely my point" was about me saying python wasn't a good comparison then? :)

[01:39] <mst> yes!

[01:39] <timotimo> %)

[01:39] <timotimo> this system is finally converging instead of oscilating! :)

[01:40] <mst> hence why I was suggesting a blog post titled 'almost, but not entirely, quite unlike python 3'

[01:40] <ShimmerFairy> mst: OK, sorry 'bout the confusion. I misread the tone of that response :)

[01:40] <mst> also hence why the dialogue where somebody compared python ended with '*shoots user again*'

[01:40] <pfhork> There's always B & C or C & D, ... ML and OCaml

[01:40] <mst> ShimmerFairy: no, no, C/C++ is my goto comparison

[01:40] <ShimmerFairy> good, mine too :)

[01:40] *** laouji_ left
[01:41] <mst> ShimmerFairy: not sure what part of 'I like C and C++ as an analogy' led you to think I disagreed :D

[01:41] <pfhork> but... I'd feel strange calling C# a Java family language; I think you only get to be in the family if you compile to java bytecode and run on the jvm. The [DC]LR might be analogous, but it's different.

[01:41] <mst> pfhork: um. lolwut?

[01:41] <ShimmerFairy> mst: that statement read to me like "oh, that's a good idea for my post" rather than "yes, I've felt the same". Sorry for misinterpreting things :D

[01:41] <mst> C# is not a *JVM* language

[01:42] <mst> but it's totally a java derivative

[01:42] <mst> the whole point was to be a java derivative except suck less

[01:42] <mst> at which I think it's succeeded admirably

[01:43] <mst> ShimmerFairy: yeah. the bit I was confused by was why you thought I liked python 2/3 as a comparison when I brought it up specifically as a thing that was obviously wrong :D

[01:43] <ShimmerFairy> If I remember my history, C# was Microsoft's way of saying "you won't let us make a Windows-based variant of Java, Sun? Well fine then, we'll make our own."

[01:43] <pfhork> mst: right, it is not. So it's not quite fair to call it a java family language. Unless there's some definition of that family that's different than what I was thinking it was.

[01:43] <mst> pfhork: wut

[01:43] <mst> language family is something totally different to runtime

[01:43] <timotimo> C# is so similar to java that i'd be willing to put them into one family

[01:43] <mst> moarvm and the perl5 VM are completely different codebases

[01:43] <boggard> except that java runs just about anywhere, and .net doesn't.

[01:43] <mst> but they're still both perl family

[01:44] <mst> pfhork: I'm talking about language families

[01:44] <mst> pfhork: runtimes are a totally separate thing

[01:44] <pfhork> okay, so here, the def of lang family is different than how I'd considered it. Duly noted.

[01:44] <boggard> those are runtime implementations.

[01:44] <llfourn> borthers from another mother :D

[01:45] <boggard> openjdk and oracle-jdk are completely different codebases as well.

[01:45] <mst> pfhork: 'things that share a runtime' are a totally different thing to language family in every conversation I've ever had about language families

[01:45] <mst> like ... lisps are definitely a language family

[01:45] <mst> 'JVM implemented languages' is an important grouping

[01:45] <pfhork> which you'd put scheme in

[01:45] <mst> common lisp, scheme, eulisp, clojure

[01:46] <mst> symbolics lisp, for all four people who still remember it

[01:46] *** chrstphrhrt left
[01:46] <pfhork> and then clojure is... on the jvm right, so you get some interoportunities

[01:46] <boggard> https://ouseful.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/proglanginfluence.png

[01:46] <boggard> the whole idea of 'language family' implies an arbitrary threshhold.

[01:47] <boggard> some languages are more closely related to each other than other languages. anything beyond that is subjective.

[01:47] <ShimmerFairy> pfhork: 'language family' is more akin to how we tend to group natural languages, e.g. Romance, Germanic, etc. That is, it's more about the similarities and history behind the language, rather than the places supporting them.

[01:47] <mst> right

[01:47] <mst> are you going to claim that java magically became a different language when the dalvik implementation was released?

[01:47] *** rurban left
[01:47] <mst> (note: I'm not saying you are, I'm just trying to illustrate what I mean)

[01:48] <timotimo> why are we even talking about this still :

[01:48] <timotimo> :)

[01:48] <timotimo> it seems to me everybody already knows everybody's position on this

[01:48] <pfhork> yeah I didn't want to waste anyone's time

[01:48] <pfhork> someone was asking about a queue or something

[01:49] <mst> timotimo: because we were trying to expand on our positions to avoid confusion

[01:49] <timotimo> OK :)

[01:49] <mst> and to present useful linguistic parallels that make the concepts clearer

[01:49] <mst> clarity is nice

[01:51] <Zoffix> llfourn, thanks :) After reading maybe too many trolls and haters about the new design it's nice to see people who do like the new design :)

[01:51] <ShimmerFairy> Along the natural language analogy: just because the UN officially supports Germanic and Romance languages, doesn't mean they're any more related to each other :)

[01:51] <Zoffix> I didn't even expect the new design to "make the news". It was a couple of hours of work over a beer lol :)

[01:51] *** laouji_ joined
[01:51] <timotimo> i like the new design

[01:51] <mst> would be nice if the link at the bottom said 'perl5 to perl6' instead of 'perl 5 to 6'

[01:51] <mst> the former would be more consistent with the 'two languages' principle

[01:51] <boggard> front page of slashdot.

[01:51] <llfourn> Zoffix: Much better than it was before and much easier to improve it from here

[01:57] <mst> sorry, we're going to have so much trauma over people failing to get it in the next year or so, I'm trying to be pedantic in advance :)

[01:57] <pfhork> Front page of /. means the same in magnitude as it did in 2000. Meanwhile other magnitudes have eclipsed it.

[01:57] <timotimo> not a bad idea

[01:57] <Zoffix> I try to view it from the positive side: "Perl: Two languages. One family" 

[01:57] <ShimmerFairy> .oO( mst -Wpedantic )

[01:58] <pfhork> May I say that mst and others are right when you think of the language from its own linage and useage perspective that you get family groupings and influences, with loan-words-and-concepts. I just, thought of family as a community or clique, which is where my difference stemmed, and C# and Java stand apart there on common libraries (some get cross ported etc, so yeah... hibernate, hibernate.net, lucene, lucene.net etc.) I may have been 

[01:59] <mst> pfhork: aha!

[01:59] <pfhork> it was quiet.

[01:59] <mst> pfhork: and I've just remembered the word I forgot to use earlier

[01:59] <mst> pfhork: JVM *ecosystem*

[01:59] <pfhork> oh; right.

[01:59] <mst> is how I see that

[01:59] *** Tideflat joined
[01:59] <mst> 'language family' versus 'platform ecosystem'

[01:59] <mst> and then I think everything is basically clear all round :D

[02:00] <mst> C# code as written/deployed is mostly in the context of the CLR/.Net ecosystem, yeah

[02:02] *** kid51 left
[02:02] *** dkm_ left
[02:04] <pfhork> Yeah. I've idly wondered if packaging and containerizing a java app on Dalvik instead of Open/Oracle JDK, would work or have any utility, peculiar or not. Pardon; I'm getting kicked out of the locale with the captive portal wifi. I appreciate the discussion and clarifications on the reporting regarding perl6. And language relationships.

[02:16] <ajjay827> Looking to get started with perl 6

[02:17] <timotimo> cool

[02:17] <timotimo> have you installed a version of rakudo yet?

[02:17] *** pecastro left
[02:17] <ajjay827> I will right now. Only after I install will it show me what I need to do. 

[02:18] <ajjay827> ?*

[02:18] <ajjay827> I know c and c++

[02:18] <timotimo> hm? "show you what you need to do"?

[02:18] <timotimo> it's also interesting to know what operating system you're on

[02:18] <ajjay827> I have a dual boot 

[02:18] <ajjay827> I use Linux and Windows 10

[02:19] <timotimo> ah, ok

[02:19] <ajjay827> Ill use Windows if the process is easier 

[02:19] <timotimo> personally, i'm a linux user, so i believe it's easiest to do it on linux; it's easy-ish to do on windows, as well ... i just don't know how

[02:19] <timotimo> we often release a .msi for rakudo star

[02:19] <Tideflat> Command-line things are often easier to do on Linux.

[02:19] <timotimo> let me see if there's something up to date

[02:20] <ajjay827> For sure

[02:20] <timotimo> oof, the newest .msi we have on offer is 2015.06

[02:21] <TimToady> better just rakudobrew something more recent

[02:21] <ajjay827> Ok

[02:21] *** laouji_ joined
[02:21] <timotimo> that's right

[02:21] <timotimo> rakudobrew works on windows, too

[02:21] <timotimo> but there's some stuff you need ... like strawberry perl? i think?

[02:21] <TimToady> probably easier on Linux

[02:22] <ajjay827> Ok sounds good. 

[02:22] <timotimo> and the MSVC compiler, which you probably have already

[02:22] *** moznion joined
[02:23] <TimToady> you might need to install build-essentials on Linux, if you haven't been developing

[02:24] <ajjay827> i just finished school for programming 

[02:24] <ajjay827> I haven't developed really anything 

[02:24] <TimToady> build-essential

[02:24] *** pecastro joined
[02:25] <ajjay827> Ok I'll do that first 

[02:25] <llfourn> (build-essential is only for debian things I think)

[02:25] <ajjay827> I have Linux mint

[02:26] <TimToady> which is debian based via ubuntu

[02:26] <ajjay827> That should work 

[02:26] *** laouji_ left
[02:26] <timotimo> yeah, should work well

[02:26] * TimToady uses mint

[02:26] <ajjay827> üëç

[02:26] <timotimo> on anything fedora-ish you'll be able to dnf groupinstall 'Development Utilities' or something similar to that

[02:26] <Tideflat> Didn't mint switch to directly from Debian?

[02:26] <timotimo> er, actually, only fedora has dnf, others have yum

[02:27] <timotimo> anyway

[02:27] *** tokuhirom joined
[02:27] * TimToady wishes irssi actually handled Unicode outside the BMP...

[02:29] <boggard> unicode is for the weak and infirm.

[02:29] <TimToady> then it's for me :)

[02:29] <ShimmerFairy> Is source-url still meant to be used in META6.json ? It's not in S22, but Panda apparently needs it.

[02:30] *** noganex_ left
[02:31] <ajjay827> Ok it's downloading 

[02:31] <timotimo> ajjay827: after build-essential, the next thing you'll want is a git clone of rakudobrew which you'll find on github

[02:31] <timotimo> github.com/tadzik/rakudobrew

[02:32] <ajjay827> Ok

[02:32] *** dbenton left

[02:37] <ajjay827> Thank you for your help. Now it's time for me to learn 

[02:37] *** timbunce_ left
[02:37] <timotimo> sure

[02:37] <timotimo> there's a nice set of slides that ought to be a good introduction to perl 6

[02:38] <timotimo> http://jnthn.net/papers/2015-spw-perl6-course.pdf

[02:38] <thowe> Man, nothing brings out the haters like suggesting Perl (especially Perl 6) should be paid attention to.

[02:38] <ajjay827> Ok

[02:39] <thowe> I should probably just not look at slashdot

[02:39] <ajjay827> Oh yeah bad ass

[02:39] <ajjay827> Thank you

[02:40] <Tideflat> Is it true that perl 6.0 has been released?

[02:40] <thowe> If I use a recent rakudobrew will I get the latest 6.0.0 dev release?

[02:40] <timotimo> 6.0 is for christmas

[02:40] <timotimo> we have 6.Birthday at the moment

[02:40] <TimToady> we just went to beta state

[02:41] <Tideflat> ah, thank you.

[02:41] <thowe> Tideflat, I think it was a dev release for the release planned for Christmas

[02:41] <Tideflat> Does perl 6 have scalar and list contexts like perl 5?

[02:41] <timotimo> not in the same way

[02:42] <TimToady> the heavy-duty language tweaks of the last year are essentially done, and now we're just doing docs, bugs, and optimizations for December

[02:42] <timotimo> you could say "not at all"

[02:42] <thowe> I went to a "tutorial" for Perl 6 at YAPC::NA not knowing much about it.  Despite being very tired and buzzed, mind was blown.

[02:42] <thowe> I think I heard context is not a thing in Perl6

[02:42] <timotimo> perl 6 has a few neat things, yeah

[02:43] <thowe> I'll be loving on Perl 5 for a long time, though.

[02:43] <TimToady> context works lazily in Perl 6, so it's a binding-time concept, not a compile-time concept

[02:44] <thowe> I'm about 4 years into playing with it and would kind of like to get a job doing it, but I'm not sure how to make that transition.

[02:44] <thowe> so I'm rewriting everything at work in Perl.

[02:46] *** ajjay827 left
[02:46] <timotimo> it's not necessarily the best strategy to just rewrite everything in perl just for rewriting in perl

[02:47] <thowe> TimToady, huh, can you link to an explanatory example?

[02:48] <thowe> timotimo, Well, it all needs to be rewritten anyway, as it sucked the first time, but I'm now better at programming in perl than anyone else here has ever been programming in anything.  The end results are helping us a lot.

[02:48] <timotimo> oh

[02:48] <timotimo> that's all right in that case

[02:49] <thowe> Redoing our CRM/Billing interface in Mojo.  Superfun

[02:49] <timotimo> oh, CRM, that's a hairy thing

[02:50] <thowe> timotimo, yeah...  It's really easy to overthink something as seemingly easy as a contact record schema

[02:51] *** laouji_ joined
[02:52] <thowe> all the bootstrappy/jQuery/ajaxy/Angular/Mojo magic I've been weaving is making people happy, though.

[02:52] <llfourn> thowe: I get good things done with angular + mojo too :)

[02:53] <thowe> "Domain Driven Design" is a nice authoritative thing to point to when I need to explain what I'm up to, also.

[02:53] *** jwhitecl joined
[02:54] *** coetry left
[02:55] <thowe> I'm sort of "community trained".  listeing to falks like mst has helped me come a long way.  I finally met other people people in person this year at YAPC::NA.  It changed me.

[02:55] <thowe> s/falks/folks/

[02:55] *** laouji_ left
[02:57] <thowe> my nonstop Perl harping has gotten another guy at work into it, so there's that

[02:57] *** jwhitecl left
[02:57] <ShimmerFairy> .ask lizmat is 'source-url' still a thing you need to put in your META6.json, or is it just something panda still needs? I ask because it's not in S22, so I'm not sure if it was missed or it's 'deprecated', in a sense.

[02:57] <yoleaux> ShimmerFairy: I'll pass your message to lizmat.

[02:58] <llfourn> good to hear that people are still learning perl given that there is no hype with it

[02:59] <boggard> thowe: that sounds like it has significant potential to not be maintainable.

[02:59] <thowe> I think it gets more attention now than 4 years ago when I stumbled into it.

[03:00] <thowe> boggard, What does?

[03:00] <boggard> (re: rewriting everything in perl only because it needs to be rewritten)

[03:00] <boggard> perl developers aren't as common as, say, java developers.

[03:02] <thowe> boggard, It's an unmaintainable random collection of poorly written redundant php files now.  I'm using a framework and an ORM lib that all my other code shares.  It's a big step up and it's helping us to unify our process and reporting infrastructure.  It's been great.

[03:03] <boggard> while i would agree that that's an improvement, it may not be the best improvement :P

[03:03] * boggard sounds like management

[03:04] <thowe> because it's Perl?

[03:05] <mst> generally if people can program, they can learn perl fine

[03:06] <thowe> mst, o hai...

[03:07] <thowe> I tried for years to spur the development in directions that others at work were more familiar with.  It went nowhere every time.  I gave up and decided to do it to suit myself, and the results have been good.

[03:08] <thowe> I find not using PHP is its own reward.

[03:08] *** skids left
[03:09] <ShimmerFairy> As far as I'm concerned, anything that leads to clearer and/or better-documented code is an improvement :)

[03:31] <TimToady> we're now in beta state, but the first actual beta release will be in a week or two

[03:32] <xtreak> TimToady :):)

[03:33] <xtreak> Is the glr work that was remaining done?

[03:33] <johnjohn101> that is exciting news that the 1st beta will be official

[07:33] <El_Che> Oh, besides the misunderstanding about what actually released, I found the attitude of people very positive

[07:40] <masak> I loved the discussion about sequence heuristics on HN. :)

[07:40] <yoleaux> 04:56Z <TimToady> masak: no, the -ME in CALL-ME is not frivolous (though admittedly a joke), because CALL is completely ambiguous about who doing the calling

[07:41] <masak> "This is cool but I still don't get how it is able to distinguish between linear, power, exponential, etc. sequences so easily."

[07:41] *** yobj joined
[07:42] <moritz> it's called "magic" :-)

[07:42] <masak> TimToady: if you say so. JavaScript has .call (and .apply), which in turn is inherited from the Scheme tradition. it works for them. I'd say there's a minimal amount of ambiguity -- if I see a method $obj.call(|@args), then I'd assume that what we're calling is the invocant.

[07:43] <masak> but maybe I misunderstand. "completely ambiguous about *who* is doing the calling" -- er, the callee of .CALL ? :)

[07:43] <masak> er, caller*

[08:22] <Ulti> gtodd yeah I had grand plans for doing nice Stats stuff like R and Pandas make a nice DataFrame class which can just plot itself nicely etc. Happy to accept anything into that repo ;P I'll try and spend a bit of time making sure what is in there works this week

[08:23] <ShimmerFairy> ooc, what's needed to get CURLI and the other stuff working for getting packages off CPAN? I think it'd be great if we didn't have just a humble ecosystem/ repository to maintain by Christmastime :)

[08:25] *** pecastro left
[08:26] <ShimmerFairy> Ulti: two things I can think of on Stats: first, unicode sub names where feasible :P (œÉ for standard deviation, for example, assuming I got the greek char right). Second, a function that told you if stats you're comparing are statistically significant.

[08:26] *** chenryn__ joined
[08:26] *** Zimoo left
[08:26] <ShimmerFairy> The 'statistically significant' stuff I've done before, but I couldn't quite figure out how to calculate the CDF whose values you use in the calculation (I'm not a stats expert).

[08:51] <jnthn> morning, #perl6

[08:51] <yoleaux> 6 Oct 2015 21:19Z <FROGGS> jnthn: the initializer is now required... works on vars, attrs but not in sigs: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/7f0e6a56ae

[08:52] *** pecastro joined
[08:52] <jnthn> ShimmerFairy: same patch looks good correctness wise :)

[08:53] <jnthn> ShimmerFairy: Can make it fail faster by moving `$cur := self."!cursor_start_cur"()` into the branch where we matched, so we dont' create a throwaway Cursor in the failing cases.

[08:54] <ShimmerFairy> jnthn: I hoped it would look good :) . I know having two conditional branches that lead to a fail cursor can seem redundant, but I figured it was clearer than trying to cram too many checks on one line.

[08:54] <ShimmerFairy> That's true. I can make the change if you'd like.

[08:54] <jnthn> (Then you don't need to bind the $cur at all in the other branches)

[08:55] <jnthn> ShimmerFairy: If you've time to do/test the tweak it's nice to have; we need all the perf help we can get in the regex engine :)

[08:56] <ShimmerFairy> jnthn: so the failing branches should just return the fail cursor, instead of binding it, I take it?

[08:56] <jnthn> ShimmerFairy: Yeah, then your if/elsif/else is the top level

[08:56] <jnthn> ShimmerFairy: uh, last statement even :)

[09:11] <FROGGS> good :o)

[09:12] <FROGGS> ShimmerFairy: well, that will grow with the number of users exponentially

[09:12] <Ven> ..and we have Inline::Perl5(/Python) :P

[09:13] <ShimmerFairy> FROGGS: of course. Reading that thread made me realize that we really need to get our CPAN interaction working (and maybe migrating the ecosystem over, if that's desired), as well as improve on documentation.

[09:14] <ShimmerFairy> Basically, the kind of stuff that would make it easier for newcomers: documentation, an easy way to distribute packages, and so on.

[09:23] <FROGGS> wow

[09:24] <jnthn> Some of them are mostly small things in need of a little design decision.

[09:25] <FROGGS> yeah

[09:25] <jnthn> There's a cluster of them around Unicode bits, and a cluster of them around I/O bits.

[09:26] <FROGGS> sometimes you start working on an RT to solve a technical issue, and instead you've to become a language designer to solve it

[09:26] <jnthn> A couple of parsing ones that I hope I can persuade TimToady++ to look into :)

[09:27] <FROGGS> hmm, I like (easyish) parsing issues

[09:27] <jnthn> Not sure how easyish they are. :)

[09:27] <jnthn> And I think they need a decision making

[09:28] <jnthn> https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=67700 https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=79174 https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=114464 are the three notable parsing ones

[09:28] <ShimmerFairy> I'd love if someone were able to solve The Inf Problem‚Ñ¢. Every time I think about it, it's quite perplexing how you'd make it work.

[09:29] <donaldh> lizmat: thanks for the weekly blog  - quick comment, the "gotten a face-lift" link goes to "about:blank" for me.

[09:29] <FROGGS> jnthn: I can make up a decision ;o)

[09:29] <lizmat> donaldh: huh?  lemme check

[09:29] <yoleaux> 02:57Z <ShimmerFairy> lizmat: is 'source-url' still a thing you need to put in your META6.json, or is it just something panda still needs? I ask because it's not in S22, so I'm not sure if it was missed or it's 'deprecated', in a sense.

[09:29] <yoleaux> 07:03Z <FROGGS> lizmat: it is a recent change, aye

[09:29] <ShimmerFairy> jnthn: didn't we decide that https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=67700  was horrible and wrong?

[09:29] * donaldh is loving the new perl.org

[09:30] <lizmat> perl6.org I assume ?

[09:30] <ShimmerFairy> that is,  $foo.meth: {...}.perl  being just like  $foo.meth({...}).perl

[09:30] <donaldh> lizmat: double : in url

[09:30] <lizmat> donaldh++  # fixed

[09:31] <FROGGS> ShimmerFairy: that would be the decision I'd make if I would be in the right position

[09:31] <jnthn> ShimmerFairy: I don't recall an actual ruling, though yeah, I think there was a leaning in that direction. :)

[09:31] <FROGGS> okay, decision made

[09:34] <FROGGS> no, it was only about blocks IIRC

[09:35] *** peperloni joined
[09:35] <peperloni> ahoy

[09:35] <FROGGS> but that would mean that  $a.b: { ... }.c  is different from  $a.b: $callable.c

[09:35] <FROGGS> which is also kinda insane

[09:36] <FROGGS> and you can easily add parens, but you cannot remove implicit parens

[09:36] <FROGGS> hi peperloni 

[09:37] <ShimmerFairy> FROGGS: ah yes, forgot it was blocks only. But still, it seems so niche and problematic. When I stumbled on it in the spec and talked about it here last time, I was quite surprised by it.

[09:37] *** peperloni left
[09:38] <FROGGS> yes, so I'm inclined to go ahead and resolve that ticket and the tests, and revise the design docs...

[09:38] <El_Che> moritz: how usable is https://github.com/moritz/perl6-Module-Starter? you put a big sign there?

[09:41] <moritz> El_Che: dunno, I haven't looked at it in ages

[09:42] <El_Che> moritz: i use module-starter often on perl5, hence the question :)

[09:42] <moritz> El_Che: feel free to take over that module if you want

[09:43] <El_Che> moritz: I need to get more knowledgable with perl6 first. Hence the porting of a known module first

[09:44] <jdv79> FROGGS: no way to find out if its "good enough" without building it out and trying.  unless you have specific issues we could look into.

[10:14] *** pmurias joined
[10:14] <lizmat> I don't think we've actually implemented it this way at the moment?

[10:15] <pmurias> having a grammar example on perl6.org would be great

[10:15] <camelia> rakudo-moar c47145: OUTPUT¬´A‚ê§¬ª

[10:15] <lizmat> according to S06:1633, that should have been an error ?   

[10:15] <jnthn> lizmat: Indeed. Another little thing to decide before Christmas.

[10:16] <jnthn> lizmat: I think the problem has always been that it makes it harder to write `new` methods

[10:16] <lizmat> should I ticket this, or is it on the list somewhere already

[10:16] <jnthn> You can ticket it

[10:16] <lizmat> will do

[10:16] <jnthn> The resolution may well end up being we change S06, but we should decide on it one way or the other.

[10:16] <lizmat> yup, indeed  :-)

[10:17] <ShimmerFairy> Note that IIRC, .new has a default :U invocant

[10:17] <ShimmerFairy> (by spec, of course)

[10:18] <lizmat> the "default" new has an :U

[10:19] <lizmat> all other .new 's would need to add it manually (as the default one actually has)

[10:20] <lizmat> jnthn: #126283 added

[10:21] *** s_kilk left
[10:22] <lizmat> at the Amsterdam.pm meeting yesterday, the general feeling about the unflattening behaviour of .push / .unshift was that it was a good decision

[10:23] <lizmat> what was less understood, was why we would *need* a .append/prepend?  Why not just teach that .push/unshift do not flatten

[10:23] <lizmat> if you want flattening there, you will need to add it yourself

[10:23] <lizmat> rather than start using .append/.prepend

[10:25] *** chenryn__ left
[10:26] <ShimmerFairy> lizmat: In a list-like class I have, I wrote an append method that takes another class like it and appends it to the invocant. In this case, it felt more natural to have a specific method for that, than to treat the object as though it were "just" a list by flattening it.

[10:26] <jnthn> lizmat: 'cus if we make folks write `@a.push($_) for @b` they'll probably be unhappy

[10:26] <ShimmerFairy> (also, I'll point out that my particular 'append' method would've happened regardless of the change being discussed :P)

[10:27] <lizmat> @a.push(flat @b) would work, would it not, jnthn?

[10:27] <jnthn> No

[10:27] <jnthn> That's the point - push received a single argument pushes a single thing

[10:28] <jnthn> *receiving 

[10:28] <jnthn> Always

[10:28] <lizmat> aaaaahhhh  hmmm... ok

[10:28] <jnthn> Oh, though we made an exception for a Slip

[10:28] <ShimmerFairy> you'd have to Slip-ify it, in which case you're pushing a singular Slip that turns into a list

[10:28] <jnthn> Still, @a.push(@b.Slip) is kinda ugly

[10:28] <ShimmerFairy> *part of a list

[10:28] <jnthn> And 'cus it's an argument list, @a.push(|@b) doesn't do the right thing.

[10:28] <ShimmerFairy> @a.push(|@b) is nicer, but still sub-optimal imo

[10:28] <ShimmerFairy> m: my @a = 1,2,3; my @b = 4,5; @a.push(|@b); say @a

[10:29] <ShimmerFairy> jnthn: apparently not?

[10:29] <jnthn> It still doesn't hit the Slip candidate

[10:29] <jnthn> It flattens the thing into the argument list

[10:29] <jnthn> To have them collected into a **@args

[10:30] <jnthn> There'll be quite a big performance difference between doing that and doing @a.append(@b)

[10:30] <lizmat> well, that may be sub-optimal from a performance point of view

[10:30] *** me joined
[10:30] <lizmat> jnthn: but if it doesn't hit the Slip candidate, why do we have a Slip candidate then ?

[11:53] <jdv79> i'd love to understand that someday.  as if a one-liner or a script are not enough.

[11:54] <suman> any plotting library in perl 6?

[11:55] <suman> I mean like ggplot2, rbokeh, ggvis, shiny??

[11:55] <arnsholt> No plotting libs yet, AFAIK

[11:55] <lizmat> there's NativeCall  :-)

[11:55] <arnsholt> That's not really a plotting library though =)

[11:56] <lizmat> no, but you should be able to interface to a plotting lib quite easily, no ?

[11:56] <arnsholt> But for plotting I'd probably just use gnuplot anyways

[11:56] *** sjn_phone joined
[11:56] <suman> lizmat how to interface to ggplot2 in perl6? Can you show me please?

[11:56] *** sjn_phone left
[11:57] *** sjn_phone joined
[11:57] <arnsholt> NativeCall is for C libs, so doing ggplot2 would probably be tricky since that's an R lib, AFAICT

[11:57] <DrForr> suman: Shell out to the binary, or use NativeCall?

[11:57] <lizmat> arnsholt: Ah, I didn't know that

[11:57] <arnsholt> Yeah, shelling out is probably the easiest way ATM

[11:58] <xtreak> I had this strange question from reddit thread as "Why does Array inherit from a numeric type?" as Array inherits from COOL. Any ideas on over why its done that way?

[11:58] <arnsholt> Well, Cool isn't really a numeric type

[11:58] <arnsholt> Cool is the supertype for things that support various kinds of default coercions and such (they're "cool" with it =)

[11:59] *** lme joined
[12:00] <suman> arnsholt shelling out??? Ain't got it? Can you point me where I can get help?

[12:01] <xtreak> So when a string is used as numeric type or vice versa the same method like e.g. sine can be used and the appropriate coercion is done ? this is where I got the question https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3nr0xo/larry_wall_unveils_perl_600/cvqo4k1

[12:01] <jdv79> maybe we should have a list of tasks people want to see

[12:01] <ShimmerFairy> lizmat: Int:_ should definitely be allowed (it just means the same as Int in most places by spec), that appears to be an oversight.

[12:01] <lizmat> yeah, looking at that now...

[12:02] *** vytas joined
[12:02] <arnsholt> suman: If you're familiar with Perl 5, it'd be something like "open my $plotter, '|-', 'gnuplot'; print $plotter $generated_gnuplot_script;"

[13:52] <jnthn> "Python and apparently Perl6/More implement recursion on the C stack" - well, if he meant Moar, then no, so they're already wrong by that point.

[13:53] <daxim> that's the kind of reply I expected, with technical details

[13:54] <jnthn> You can be as many callframes deep as you like when you take, it's not a local CPS transform.

[13:54] <jnthn> Same with await.

[13:54] <n0tjack> my favorite lang (J) still uses the C stack for recursion, and it drives me nuts

[13:54] <n0tjack> breaks on me at least twice a year

[13:56] <jnthn> Moar's "stack" frames actually live on the heap, and our gather/take impl is actually done in terms of delimited continuations, fwiw.

[13:57] <brrt> oh, and to clear up any confusion on the point. MoarVM uses a run-time assembler from the LuaJIT project. it doesn't use LuaJIT proper, and none of the things that make luajit fast are taken over from luajit

[13:57] <brrt> *just* the assembler and a runtime preprocessor :-)

[14:21] <csd_> -MMoose doesn't seem to affect anything

[14:22] <lizmat> csd_: perl6 has Moose like capabilities built in

[14:27] <_itz> oh the osname for 64bit Perl 5 is MSWin32

[14:27] <_itz> confusing

[14:30] <brrt> yes. yes it is

[14:30] <brrt> actually, i think (although I don't speak for perl5 developers at all) that is because MSwin32 is the *platform name*

[14:31] <gfldex> win32 is the windows api name

[14:31] <_itz> ah

[14:31] <brrt> as in, win32 is the name of the OS+APIs, regardless of whether the actual CPU architecture is 32 of 64 bit (or even x86 based)

[15:58] <TimToady> which we could save about 2.5% on by revising

[15:59] *** chenryn__ left
[15:59] <TimToady> that is, last I measured a couple weeks ago, we had 2.5% overhead on dynvar lookup in compiling setting

[15:59] <nine> jdv79: no, Test::WWW::WebKit of course doesn't help with cross browser testing. However it's great to test the JS parts of your application on a very standards conformant engine. We've found that if you don't do anything crazy, it's quite sufficient.

[16:00] <TimToady> and a better cache scheme would reduce that to near 0

[16:00] *** antiatom left
[16:00] <jnthn> absence: There was a 2015.09 release; the MSI is typically a bit behind the source releases

[16:00] <TimToady> absence: the headlines on those stories are less accurate than the stories themselves, which indicate a Christmas release

[16:00] <PerlJam> absence: you can always built it yourself or use rakudobrew

[16:01] <TimToady> we just went into beta state on my birthday, and the first beta will come out in a week or so as a real compiler release

[16:01] * jnthn heard someone mention working on the MSI a bit earlier on today, so mebbe it'll be there within the next day or two.

[16:01] <TimToady> the point, however, is that the current HEAD is beta, and being treated like a beta

[16:03] <TimToady> we had it right associative, and that was a problem

[16:05] *** kjs_ joined
[16:05] <b2gills> Also that doesn't work if I swap `is assoc` and `is equiv`

[16:06] *** laouji joined

[16:06] <TimToady> b2gills: you don't need the assoc except to override the default for the precedence level

[16:07] *** donaldh joined
[16:07] <TimToady> and I see that I neglected to add a proto in the setting...

[16:07] <TimToady> but since it's hardwired in the parser anyway, it just uses the <O %concatenation> thing there

[16:08] <TimToady> so a proto doesn't really need the equiv

[16:08] *** grondilu joined

[16:19] <TimToady> jnthn: how much overhead are we taking on our binary operators that do ($?, $?) instead of (|)?

[16:19] <TimToady> (in the proto)

[16:19] <jnthn> Umm...I'd have to go look

[16:20] <TimToady> might want an 'is count(2)' if we want to just lie about a |

[16:20] <jnthn> I *think* we ended up with hitting the multi-cache in those cases though

[16:20] <jnthn> Because you can only get an entry in the multi cache if you went through the proto's check at some point

[16:20] <jnthn> So it's a one-off overhead per type tuple

[16:29] <TimToady> well, sure, but that's not the common meaning of arity

[16:29] <b2gills> I was just thinking that if you forced to the count to 2 in binary operators it could prevent the ability to optimize `[+] 1,2,3` with `sub infix:<+> (@_) { .... }` or so

[17:31] *** espadrine left
[17:32] <masak> liztormato: one is that named variables are better documentation than anonymous variables, and it's not the compiler's job to force me to make named variables anonymous.

[17:32] <liztormato> But what made niecza's warnings so annoying?

[17:32] <masak> liztormato: another is that sometimes I have multis, and in some of the candidates I don't end up using a parameter, even though I still declared it for consistency.

[17:32] <n0tjack> is it necessary or recommended to use strict; use warnings; at the top of p6 scripts?

[17:32] <liztormato> Ok, so parameters should be exempt?

[17:32] <masak> liztormato: the fact that I felt I was right and the compiler should stay out of my business made warnings so annoying.

[17:33] <FROGGS> liztormato: think of multi subs where dont use all params in all candidates, it will warn about the unused

[17:33] <FROGGS> where you*

[17:33] <masak> liztormato: to be honest, I'd prefer if there weren't warnings for correct things such as unused variables.

[17:52] <[Coke]> steve-robot:  that's literally all of the code? what are you entering at the prompt?

[18:31] <timotimo> it's about the "take as many as you like" thing?

[18:31] <lizmat> FROGGS: since we're going to handle the initializer on attributes with :D differently, maybe we would need an "use attributes :D" pragma as well ?

[18:31] <TimToady> I've been fixing up some arity/counts, but not yet 'so'

[18:31] <moritz> I guess it's messing up the zero-args case

[18:32] <timotimo> thank you, TimToady 

[18:32] <FROGGS> lizmat: hmmm, good question

[18:33] *** mprelude joined
[18:33] <FROGGS> lizmat: I would not say no to an attributes pragma, on the other hand I find all of these pragmas kinda weird

[18:33] <lizmat> well, without the pragma's, we wouldn't need Int:_

[18:33] <FROGGS> troo

[18:34] <FROGGS> I just can't imagine that somebody will use these pragmas, is all

[18:34] <lizmat> I'm pretty sure *I* would

[18:34] <FROGGS> hehe

[18:34] <lizmat> and possibly use them in the settings with :D all of them

[18:35] *** coetry left
[18:35] <lizmat> even to the point I was thinking of 'use smileys :D' would be doing all of them  :-)

[18:36] <ab5tract_> FROGGS: "all of these pragmas" -> what pragmas are you referring to, ooc?

[18:36] <lizmat> use smileys :D would be the same as: use variables :D; use attributes :D; use parameters :D; use invocant :D

[18:37] <FROGGS> ab5tract_: ^^

[18:37] <FROGGS> :o)

[18:37] <ab5tract_> :)

[18:37] <FROGGS> except there is no 'use smileys'

[18:38] <FROGGS> I guess 'use invocant :D' really does make sense, in so far that you often add to all methods except .new

[18:38] <ab5tract_> fwiw, I like it. but I have to say part of that attraction lies in the cute factor, which I know can be a turn off to others

[18:38] <ab5tract_> but from that perspective, one could argue that it's a good way to avoid those folks ;)

[18:40] <lizmat> probably something for a macro then

[18:44] <steve-robot> FROGGS: Although my problem is now resolved, I just can't figure out what +$_ does? Black magic? 

[18:45] <FROGGS> steve-robot: $_ contains a string, your input, and the + prefix op numifies it

[18:45] <FROGGS> steve-robot: so it turns a string that turns a valid number into said number type

[19:18] <jnthn> TimToady: Optional parameters don't have a variable name to bind to and so we don't even go so far as to create containers

[19:19] <st_iron> timotimo: I used it in the past (way years back) to measure something

[19:19] <timotimo> you do know that this for loop is useless? :)

[19:19] <st_iron> timotimo: I just wrote it to perl6 to look at it :)

[19:19] <jnthn> El_Che: We can document that, and point people to just grab a normal Windows build and use it under cygwin, which should be good enough for most cases.

[19:20] <st_iron> ouch, so I killed my notebook

[19:20] <st_iron> "sit down, rtfm mr. iron" :)

[19:20] <timotimo> st_iron: you'll get a single run of the for loop with the complete contents of that file

[19:20] <flussence> that doesn't seem like... very computer-murdery code

[19:20] <timotimo> you'd probably prefer using "lines" to iterate

[19:20] <timotimo> can you tell us how big exactly your dict file is?

[19:21] <jnthn> TimToady: Don't see a reason why \a? couldn't work; it'd jsut shove Any (or Mu, or whatever declared type) in there

[19:21] <flussence> oh, the regexing a giant string part might be a little painful, yeah... (but why does it do that?)

[19:35] <TimToady> n0tjack: two reasons: 1) slightly faster if the listop is implemented in terms of the method, and 2) you don't have to worry about a list infix eating up the block accidentally

[19:56] <FROGGS> uff, we have about 50 ppl more in here as usual

[19:57] <TimToady> for some strange reason :)

[19:58] <FROGGS> I've heard good things about that specific strange reason :o)

[19:58] <[Coke]> do we have a writeup somewhere of when we'd want append instead of push?

[19:59] <[Coke]> moritz: I wonder how recent the perl6 that's being used to build docs is.

[19:59] <FROGGS> [Coke]: it is from last weekend

[20:00] <lizmat> hmmm.. just had a non-repeatable hang on t/spec/S17-supply/syntax.t

[20:00] <dalek> roast: review: https://github.com/perl6/roast/commit/d9a5f454c6

[20:01] <boggard> is there a perl IDE written in perl6 yet?

[20:01] <FROGGS> [Coke]: .append does Single Arg Rule‚Ñ¢ IIRC - which is like... "I don't care what data I push", or so

[20:01] <TimToady> lizmat: yeah, and I just had a double free on something else, so we're still a bit flakey in spots

[20:01] <FROGGS> boggard: no

[20:01] <boggard> that's too bad. seems like it would be a fun project.

[20:02] <TimToady> but then it would turn into an editor, and we'd have to go out and hang ourselves

[20:02] <saaki> you mean "hell, yea, i'm taking that sucker on!"

[20:02] <boggard> considering how easily extended perl6 is...

[20:02] <[Coke]> FROGGS: I basically have no idea if any of the 10 instances of push are wanting an update.

[20:02] <FROGGS> boggard: well, it is your chance to "register" the perfect name, and start hacking :o)

[20:02] <boggard> thinking about it :P

[20:02] <TimToady> [Coke]: if it was working before, append is always safe

[20:03] *** dbenton joined
[20:03] <TimToady> append is +args semantics, and push is **args semantics, so push will never flatten anything, and will push one thing for each comma-separated item at a syntactic level

[20:04] <dha> So, what is the C<:&as> in "multi sub    unique(*@values, :&as) returns Seq:D"? It's not covered in the documentation?

[20:04] <TimToady> the difference is if you say .push: @foo you get the array pushed as a single item, but .append: @foo will split it up and push each element of @foo

[20:05] *** darutoko left
[20:06] *** laouji joined
[20:06] <lizmat> dha: the :as indicates how you would like to transform values seen before judging them unique

[20:06] <dha> That's what I figured, but the documentation contradicts that.

[20:07] <leedo_> is there an equivalent to `perldoc -f` with perl6? i'm not getting a perl6doc or seeing anything i perl6 --help

[20:08] <PerlJam> leedo_: not yet, unfortunately.

[20:08] <dha> oh, wait. it may not contradict it, as such. But you have to know what C´<===>ª does to have any idea what's going on, as written.

[20:08] <leedo_> ah ok, thanks

[20:08] <moritz> well, perl6/doc comes with a small command line tool for viewing docs, but it's mostly broken right now :(

[20:11] <moritz> [Coke]: yes

[20:11] <dha> AS seems insufficiently descriptive.

[20:11] <moritz> [Coke]: lib/Perl6/* is run, iirc

[20:11] <lizmat> COMPARE_AS

[20:11] <lizmat> ?

[20:11] <dha> Particularly as the following documentation is unclear.

[20:11] <dha> ah., that would work.

[20:12] <moritz> maybe just fix the documentation?

[20:12] <lizmat> COMPARE-AS   perhaps ?

[20:43] <ZoffixWork> (Is there a Perl 5 EOL being discussed?)

[20:43] <dha> So, as a subroutine it takes an integer, but it serves as a method to List.

[22:55] <grondilu> STD.pm is very much used by rakudo, I think.

[22:56] <gfldex> Commits on Feb 24, 2015 

[22:56] <gfldex> that's quite some time ago

[22:56] <cognominal> After the Perl 6 denial phase,  general perception will shift to the "blind men and the elephant" phase.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant  :)

[22:57] <grondilu> STD.pm is edited as often as the rest of rakudo, but it is from times to times.

[22:57] <grondilu> *is not*

[22:57] <grondilu> let me rephrase that

[22:57] <grondilu> STD.pm is *not* edited as often as the rest of rakudo, but it is from times to times.

[22:57] <grondilu> usually byt TimToady 

[22:58] <sitaram_> hi all; I'm pretty new to perl 6 (but not perl 5).  How does perl 6 compare in terms of speed?  I have a plain text program plus data that seems to be at least 2 orders of magnitude slower so I am sure I screwed up somewhere, but thought I'd ask about general impressions of perl 6 (Rakudo, moarvm, 2015-07 version) speed first

[22:58] <sitaram_> s/plain text program/plain text handling task/

[22:58] <thou> OK, I was prompted to consider this since STD was sorted into the "Historical Compilers" section on the Compilers tab

[22:59] <grondilu> Perl 6 is still slow for most task, but it's improving fast

[22:59] <grondilu> *slower*

[22:59] *** tokuhirom left
[23:00] <grondilu> thou: I'm not sure but I think it's a bit complicated as there are several versions of STD if I'm not mistaken.  The official one serves as a reference or something.

[23:00] <sitaram_> grondilu: thanks

[23:01] <gfldex> sitaram_: the inliner doesn't inline much, the optimiser doesn't optimise much and the JIT doesn't jit much right now. That will change with time.

[23:03] <grondilu> (hopefully that will change before Xmas)

[23:03] <sitaram_> gfldex: :)

[23:03] <donaldh> sitaram_: since you're running rakudo on MoarVM, you can profile your program and get a great interactive HTML report.

[23:04] <gfldex> sitaram_: you could also like a nopaste here and we can have a look

[23:04] <sitaram_> donaldh: naah; I was only playing with a straightforward grep-type task.  I'll paste, as gfldex said.  Give me a minute or three.

[23:05] <AlexDaniel> sitaram_: by the way, although you might not get better performance (comparing to perl5) with regular code, you might try parallelizing it!

[23:05] <AlexDaniel> sitaram_: and since this is pretty easy with perl6, there is a chance that you will get better wall clock time

[23:05] *** yqt left
[23:06] *** firstdayonthejob left
[23:06] <AlexDaniel> sitaram_: also, most of the execution time is actually startup time, did you account that?

[23:07] <donaldh> sitaram_: it's as easy as perl6 --profile script.p6

[23:08] <thou> grondilu: I hear you, but I also think it's a poor representation to have http://perl6.org/compilers/std-viv show "Note: STD and viv aren't actively developed any more" warning, but also indicate that it is the "official Perl 6 grammar" on the Design page.

[23:09] <sitaram_> AlexDaniel: informally, I did account for startup and it's still pretty high

[23:10] <[Coke]> thou: good point.

[23:10] <sitaram_> gfldex: http://paste.fedoraproject.org/276148/44259295 is the coe.  https://dimroc-public.s3.amazonaws.com/etl-language-comparison/tweets20140416.tar.gz but I worked with only one percent of it (10,000 lines from each file instead of the million in each that exist there)

[23:11] <sitaram_> this takes 47 seconds.  The perl 5 version... don't ask (about 3.2 seconds for the full dataset.  That would be over 3 orders of magnitude!)

[23:11] <sitaram_> AlexDaniel: hence why I am assuming startup-time is not what I am seeing here :)

[23:12] <sitaram_> oops; s/coe/code/ 3 messages above

[23:12] <TimToady> note that we're quite a bit faster than the 2015-07 version already

[23:12] <grondilu> viv very much worked along with STD and really is not developped anymore.  But STD still is used I think.

[23:13] *** donaldh left
[23:13] <TimToady> STD was a prototype grammar, and was always meant to be thrown away

[23:13] <[Coke]> grondilu: from observing how it's used, it's a reference for rakudo at this point.

[23:13] <[Coke]> basically, once TimToady started commiting to rakudo...

[23:13] <AlexDaniel> sitaram_: also, are you running on 32-bit or 64-bit system?

[23:13] <TimToady> and hardly even that; rakudo has surpassed STD in many respects

[23:15] <sitaram_> AlexDaniel: aah that could be it; this is 32-bits.  Thanks for reminding me of that

[23:16] <AlexDaniel> sitaram_: well, the thing is that there is no JIT for 32-bit, as far as I know

[23:16] <AlexDaniel> yet?

[23:16] <TimToady> 2015-07 was pre-GLR, so slow on list processing

[23:16] <AlexDaniel> sitaram_: there is nothing wrong with your code, I think

[23:17] *** rurban joined
[23:17] <AlexDaniel> sit

[23:17] <AlexDaniel> sitaram_: so, have you tried profiling it? What does it say?

[23:18] <sitaram_> AlexDaniel: looking at the HTML; overview page says no JIT (JIT bar is 0%).  I'll take a look on a 64-bit system when I get to work

[23:19] <sitaram_> "JIT-compiled frames [blank color bar]", then "0% (0)"

[23:19] <AlexDaniel> sitaram_: even though there is no JIT, it shouldn't be as slow as it is right now, I think. Where did it spend most of its time?

[23:21] <gfldex> sitaram_: i took the first 10000 lines of the first tweet file and get real    0m3.574s

[23:21] <gfldex> user    0m3.520s

[23:21] <gfldex> sys     0m0.052s

[23:22] <AlexDaniel> gfldex: woah!

[23:22] <sitaram_> AlexDaniel: which part of the HTML would tell me?  The "Routines" part seems to be internals

[23:23] <sitaram_> gfldex: that would make 3*13 seconds for all 13 files (which is what I used)

[23:23] <[Coke]> profiling includes internals. There might want to be a way to elide those from the profile html at some point.

[23:24] <thou> [Coke]: Thanks, that works

[23:24] <gfldex> it's 64bit but a fairly slow AMD Athlon(tm) II X2 260 Processor

[23:25] <AlexDaniel> sitaram_: It's OK if there are internals, because I think that the internals are slowing you down

[23:25] <AlexDaniel> sitaram_: as I've said, I see nothing wrong with your code

[23:25] <[Coke]> I would definitely retry on a recent version.

[23:26] <AlexDaniel> sitaram_: but if you are seeing some performance issue which is just as bad, then perhaps it is worth reporting it!

[23:26] <sitaram_> [Coke]: and on 64-bit :)  No point looking at it if there's no JIT!

[23:27] <AlexDaniel> there was some project that compared the code speed across different perl6 versions

[23:27] <AlexDaniel> and also perl5‚Ä¶

[23:27] <AlexDaniel> is it dead now?

[23:27] <sitaram_> AlexDaniel: I'll try 64-bit on a more recent version this weekend

[23:29] *** mscha left
[23:33] <AlexDaniel> sitaram_: if you find that it is still *really* slow even with JIT, then just submit a bug report. Maybe it would also make sense to submit a test for perl6-bench, so that you can see how it will improve over time‚Ä¶

[23:34] <AlexDaniel> sitaram_: especially considering that you probably have a perl5 version of the same code :)

[23:36] *** laouji joined
[23:37] <sitaram_> AlexDaniel: I do indeed; it takes about 6 second for the full set (not 3 seconds; I mis-typed that earlier).  Same basic code -- this isn't a complex "algorithm" :)

[23:37] <sitaram_> I'll do that; it'll have to be the weekend or so though :(

[23:38] <AlexDaniel> sitaram_: it does not have to be a complex algorithm :)

[23:39] <AlexDaniel> sitaram_: in fact, a golfed-down version is preferable :)

[23:40] <TimToady> well, I can see several reasons P5 would do much better on that particular problem than P6 in its current state; primarily because P5 goes to great pains to avoid getting into the regex engine if it can help it

[23:40] <AlexDaniel> for a bug report

[23:40] *** laouji left
[23:41] <TimToady> and also because P5 can process UTF-8 in it's raw form as if it were ASCII when you aren't actually searching for anything outside of ASCII

[23:41] *** chrstphrhrt left
[23:42] <sitaram_> AlexDaniel: if you mean https://github.com/japhb/perl6-bench, I'd like to first ask whoever runs it how they want the data I suppose.  The largest file in that repo right now is less than a MB; I hesitate to add 13MB to it in one shot!

[23:43] <AlexDaniel> sitaram_: I'd say pre-generate it automatically, it does not have to be some real data

[23:43] <sitaram_> aah ok

[23:43] <sitaram_> sure

[23:43] <ShimmerFairy> TimToady: I know you mentioned $= for pod being a potential issue with things like  $ = 42  earlier, and I just thought that we could change the Pod twigil to $|pod etc. if needed. (pipe being in the leading declarative comment #| , compared to trailing #=)

[23:44] <TimToady> I decided that a $= prefix was kinda silly when you can just use the item function

[23:44] <sitaram_> thanks everyone; it's just gone 5am here and my day starts...

[23:45] <TimToady> I take it you're in, like, India or so

[23:45] <sitaram_> TimToady: yup :)

[23:45] <TimToady> well, have a great day!

[23:45] <flussence> wouldn't pod data be more appropriate as a simple $? variable, since it's compile-time constant and all...?

[23:45] <ShimmerFairy> TimToady: ok. Just thought I'd bring up a possible alternate twigil if it turned out to be needed :)

[23:45] <AlexDaniel> sitaram_: http://www.jnthn.net/papers/2014-yapceu-performance.pdf
