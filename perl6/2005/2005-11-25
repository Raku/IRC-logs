[00:33] <mugwump> stevan_: about?

[01:18] <stevan_> mugwump: hey

[01:31] <mugwump> hey stevan.  I want to get at the C3 algorithm for T2 metamodels.  Is there an interface for just running the algorithm without everything else?

[01:31] <mugwump> (in Class::C3)

[01:33] <stevan_> mugwump: yes, Class::C3::calculateMRO($class) will return the linearized class list

[01:33] <mugwump> thanks

[01:33] <stevan_> no problem

[01:35] <mugwump> ah, but the input is partially provided through @{"foo::ISA"} etc

[01:35] <stevan_> yes

[01:35] <stevan_> you could probably extract the algorithm without too much trouble

[01:36] <stevan_> there are a decent set of tests in Class:C3 as well as the Perl6::MetaModel which you can use to test against

[01:36] <stevan_> I took all those from the C3 papers too, so they should be right

[01:37] <stevan_> mugwump: actually Class::C3::_merge is the algorithm 

[01:38] <stevan_> you can just use that,.. just feed it the right input

[01:38] <stevan_> model what calculateMRO does but according to T2's metamodel

[01:38] <stevan_> gotta run though &

[01:38] <mugwump> thanks again!

[01:57] <devin> anyone seen this Pugs buildfailure before?  http://paste.lisp.org/display/13960

[02:04] <scook0> devin: odd ... you're just compiling a vanilla checkout?

[02:04] <scook0> what platform are you on?

[02:05] <devin> freebsd

[02:05] <devin> it's a vanilla checkout, yes

[02:05] <devin> freebsd 4.x i should say

[02:06] <scook0> are those two 'missing' files actually in your pugs tree?

[02:07] <devin> yes

[02:07] <devin> seems to be an include path issue

[02:09] <svnbot6> r8007 | Darren_Duncan++ |  /ext/Rosetta-Incubator : multiplied all module minor-version numbers by 10 so they are backwards compatible with the older X.YY-versioned releases with respect to ordering

[02:13] <devin> my builds used to work fine, i guess i should binary-search the svn to find out which commit broke it

[02:38] <aufrank> hello!

[02:40] <aufrank> happy thanksgiving, where applicable

[02:40] <aufrank> happy thursday, where applicable

[02:40] <aufrank> happy localtime, otherwise

[02:41] <aufrank> I have a question about reading the synopses:

[02:42] <aufrank> are people able to get the unicode characters to display correctly by doing, for example, perldoc S02.pod?

[03:03] <Khisanth> aufrank: don't see why not, is your terminal setup correctly?

[03:04] <aufrank> I thought so...

[03:05] <aufrank> can't get it to work properly in either an xterm under x11 or the OSX terminal.app

[03:05] <aufrank> S05.pod:1: Unknown command paragraph "=encoding utf8"

[03:06] <aufrank> This is perl, v5.8.7 built for darwin-thread-multi-2level

[03:06] <Khisanth> ah that

[03:06] <aufrank> yes, that apparently ;)

[03:06] <aufrank> what was that, again?

[03:06] <aufrank> :P

[03:07] <Khisanth> that is a completely different issue!

[03:07] <aufrank> oh

[03:07] <aufrank> Khisanth, will you please help me with a completely different issue?

[03:16] * aufrank is still around if anyone has suggestions about displaying utf8 characters in POD under OSX

[03:24] <Khisanth> aufrank: well the problem is that whoever wrote that decided to use some non standard pod formatting

[03:25] <Khisanth> that might very well be specced for the p6 version of perldoc but it isn't for p5

[03:29] <aufrank> ok

[03:29] <aufrank> I just want to see the pretty hyper operators :)

[03:30] <Khisanth> but .... operators are not in 5!

[03:30] <aufrank> I got over it and read a few before I came on here to whine 

[03:31] <Khisanth> and there is always http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/synopsis.html :)

[03:32] <aufrank> it makes me feel hardcore and 1337 to check them out with svk

[03:32] <aufrank> that proves I'm a real hacker, right, checking out the source ;)  ??

[03:37] * aufrank goes back to syn reading

[03:37] <aufrank> thanks for the input, Khisanth 

[03:40] <Khisanth> my svk seems to have broken for no apparent reason

[04:01] <dduncan> the CPAN indexer seems to have been updated to support X.Y.Z version numbers ... yay!

[07:29] <xgl> i think i have a potential fix for one of the pugsbugs, how do i check it in?

[07:30] <luqui> xgl, you don't have a committer bit?

[07:30] <luqui> send the patch to [email@hidden.address]
[07:30] <xinming> xgl: you could ask autrijus for one

[07:31] <xgl> no i don't ... how do i get it?

[07:31] <luqui> I figure he will send xgl a committer bit instead of applying the patch :-)

[07:31] <luqui> sorry

[07:31] <luqui> don't send it there

[07:31] <xgl> ok ... how do i do regression testing to make sure i haven't broken something else?

[07:31] <luqui> send it to [email@hidden.address]
[07:31] <luqui> make test

[07:31] <xinming> xgl: http://dev.perl.org/perl6/lists/

[07:32] <xgl> thanx luqui and xinming

[07:32] <luqui> I'm not sure what the status of that is, though

[07:32] <luqui> make test takes a long time

[07:33] <luqui> the way I usually do it is I find the t/ files that relate to what I changed and run those

[07:33] <xgl> yeah ... that's my worry ... it takes my laptop 20 minutes just to build pugs

[07:33] <xgl> ok, i'll do that then ... better than nothing

[07:33] <gaal> xgl: /msg me your email addr?

[07:34] <luqui> smoke will catch you if you break something

[07:34] <gaal> xgl: yout laptop is fast.

[07:34] <xgl> gaal, did you get my email address?

[07:36] <gaal> yes, openfoundry is being slow

[07:36] <xgl> 20 minutes is incremental build ... clean build probably takes a bit longer ...

[07:36] <gaal> invitation sent. welcome aboard :)

[07:37] <gaal> luqui: i notice you are a metacommitter

[07:37] <xgl> thanx gaal :)

[07:37] <luqui> oh.  that's good to know

[07:37] <gaal> np :)

[16:27] <xgl> is there a process for retiring tests from pugs/t/pugsbugs, or do i just remove them?

[16:27] <luqui> uh..

[16:27] <luqui> you don't remove tests

[16:27] <Khisanth> retiring? shouldn't tests always be there to make sure it doesn't show up again?

[16:28] <luqui> move them into the appropriate category in t/, I think

[16:28] <Khisanth> regression testing after all...

[16:28] <xgl> ah, you're right ... move them then?

[16:28] <geoffb> pugsbugs/ is only for bugs that you could not figure out where to put.

[16:28] <geoffb> If you now know where the tests should go, you should move them . . . 

[16:28] <geoffb> regardless of whether they have been fixed yet.

[16:29] <geoffb> We want to keep pugsbugs small, because whenever working on a particular problem,

[16:29] <xgl> ok, seems like the right thing to do is to move them to the right category, or at least mark them to be something other than bugs

[16:29] <geoffb> people have to both look in the correct directory for tests, *and* sift through all of pugsbugs looking for appropriate stuff.

[16:30] <geoffb> xgl, yes, move them if you can.
