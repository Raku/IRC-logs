[14:01] <wolverian> who the heck thought that the Gnome C API documentation is adequate for the Perl bindings? sigh

[14:01] <wolverian> </grumble>

[14:02] <webmind> a moron :)

[14:03] <webmind> what are you trying to do ?

[14:04] <wolverian> a simple editor/project tree with gtksourceview and GnomeVFS 

[14:04] <webmind> k

[14:05] <Limbic_Region> must be too early in the morning - I saw that entire conversation between wolverian and webmind as one individual talking with themself

[14:06] <gaal> it is always too early in the morning. except for when it's too late at night

[14:06] <rafl> wolverian: The bindings map the C API quite closely, so I think they are.

[14:07] <wolverian> rafl, I obviously disagree. maybe it's because I haven't used the C bindings or the Perl bindings before.

[14:08] <rafl> wolverian: The only think you'll need to get used to is to know on which layer of abstraction you can find the methods/signals/properties you want.

[14:08] <rafl> wolverian: Then the POD docs will be quite useful.

[14:10] <wolverian> right.

[14:10] <wolverian> what the heck - I see Gnome2::VFS::Monitor in the docs but not on CPAN

[14:11] <rafl> The PODs are generated at built time and therefor not indexed on CPAN.

[14:11] <wolverian> well, it's not in the Ubuntu libgnome2-vfs-perl package either. but maybe I just need to install it from CPAN, then.

[14:12] <rafl> wolverian: The POD docs are included in Debians libgnome2-vfs-perl (which I also maintain).

[14:12] <wolverian> I mean the module itself.

[14:13] <rafl> Debian sid has the same version as Ubuntu dapper

[14:13] <wolverian> yeah, I'm on dapper. weird

[14:15] <wolverian> oh, maybe I'm misunderstanding how it works

[14:15] <rafl> As far as I see the packages are pretty much identical.

[14:15] <wolverian> am I supposed to do 'use Gnome2::VFS::Monitor;' at all?

[14:15] <rafl> No. They are all glued into one shared object that's loaded when you use Gnome2::VFS

[14:16] <rafl> perl -MGnome2::VFS -MData::Dumper -e'print Dumper(\%Gnome2::VFS::Monitor::)'

[14:18] <wolverian> right. thanks a lot. rafl++ # has patience with dumbasses like me

[14:19] <rafl> wolverian: np. Can you tell me what's in the Maintainer field of that package? I'd like to know if they use the same packages that HE and I provide for Debian. But it isn't listed on the webpages..

[14:22] <wolverian> Maintainer: Gtk2-Perl Maintainers [email@hidden.address]
[14:24] <rafl> OK, then they simply use our packages..

[14:49] <fglock> hi all!

[14:51] <Limbic_Region> salutations fglock

[14:53] <fglock> hi Limbic_Region

[14:53] <fglock> I've been away for too long - I hope I can come here more often now :)

[14:54] <Limbic_Region> we hope so too

[14:54] * Limbic_Region wonders if $larry has used his commit bit yet

[14:56] <fglock> I'm trying to writing down my view of the implementation of "lazy"

[14:57] <integral> Limbic_Region: I've seen it happen twice!

[14:58] <Limbic_Region> good, that means he is actually using Pugs which means he will be writing p6 code and get frustrated when it doesn't work and that will mean he will write tests and update design docs so that stuff can be implemented

[14:58] <Limbic_Region> this is a "good thing"

[14:59] <luqui> he is also learning haskell, so he can hack on the internals (or... probably not)

[15:00] <Limbic_Region> luqui - personally, I would rather he be hacking on the p5 parser if that isn't finished yet

[15:00] <Limbic_Region> but anything/everything he does is appreciated

[15:01] <luqui> right, his energy is best used elsewhere

[15:04] <fglock> I'm trying to figure out what "Generator" is. It looks like it is the low-level implementation of Lazy-list

[15:04] <fglock> I don't think I understand completely what's the difference between List and Array

[15:06] <fglock> I'm trying to understand it in this context: http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/msg/6c306a1b0b885b5a

[15:07] <Limbic_Region> fglock - sorry I can't help.  luqui is much more in a position to distinguish between what is a List and what is an Array

[15:10] <fglock> This part make sense to me - Larry said: "there's really no such thing as a List.  The basic list types  are actually Eager and Lazy, and an Array conveniently contains one of each"

[15:11] <luqui> fglock, the biggest difference between Array and List is that Lists are immutable

[15:11] <luqui> but other than that, it's kinda fuzzy

[15:11] <luqui> I mean, I could tell you which is which in a given context, but I couldn't really tell you why

[15:12] <luqui> so, maybe it's just fuzzy to me

[15:13] <fglock> removing "generator" and "list", and using "eager" and "lazy" - it works to me; this maps to the actual implementation in p5 backend

[15:15] <fglock> I'm not comfortable with "Lists are immutable". "Lazy" is not immutable - you can "pop" and "shift" from it

[15:16] <fglock> I mean, it is an iterator, and the state changes each time you access it

[15:19] * Limbic_Region finds the idea of popping/shifting a list nauseating

[15:20] <Limbic_Region> my $second = (1..10)[3]; # is fine

[15:20] <Limbic_Region> my $first = shift (1..10); # is not

[15:22] <fglock> when you say (1..10)[3] it is a slice operation - Lists don't do that (I think), so it is actually an Array operation. The "shift" is an error because the Array is read-only (again, I think so)

[15:23] <Limbic_Region> fglock - in p5 lists do that and as I said, I am not qualified to distinguish between lists and arrays in p6

[15:28] <luqui> fglock, you don't pop from lists

[15:29] <luqui> you can think of it this way:  get the list out of the array, and then put it back in to the array without its final element

[15:29] <luqui> in perl 5, a list is rougly the thing that a function returns when it returns multiple values

[15:29] <luqui> you can put it into an array, but you can't pop from the list of return values directly

[15:30] <luqui> in perl 6 we'd like to make such a list an object

[15:32] <fglock> luqui: (1..10)[3] operates on an anonymous array?

[15:32] <fglock> which contains an eager list

[15:33] <fglock> (bbiab)

[15:40] <dvtoo> are lists mutable?

[15:40] <luqui> that's what we're arguing

[15:40] <dvtoo> oh, I see, sorry

[15:40] <luqui> no problem

[15:41] <Limbic_Region> (1..10)[3] working on an anonymous array bothers me

[15:41] <luqui> fglock, I never said that you can't subscript a list

[15:41] <Limbic_Region> it implies I can take a reference to it

[15:41] <Limbic_Region> and keep it around

[15:41] <Limbic_Region> and change it

[15:47] <fglock> Limbic_Region: (1..10) is a List, but (1..10)[3] is an Array slice, which point to a read-only scalar - if you try to assign (1..10)[3]=4 it will be an error because you are trying to assign to a read-only scalar

[15:52] <luqui> fglock, that is a very perl5esque way to think of it.  do you think that it's clean?

[15:53] <luqui> it doesn't feel clean to me...

[15:53] <luqui> but that may just be me

[15:53] <luqui> oh, wait, you're wrong :-)

[15:54] <luqui> perl -ce '(1..10)[3] = 5'

[15:54] <luqui> Can't modify list slice in scalar assignment at -e line 1, at EOF

[15:54] <luqui>             ^^^^^^^^^^

[15:58] <Juerd> A "List"?

[15:58] <luqui> what about it?

[15:58] <Juerd> Still doesn't make sense to me.

[15:58] <Juerd> If it needs to be an object, it can be an Array.

[15:58] <Juerd> List as a type feels weird.

[15:59] <luqui> I think there really is a logical distinction there

[15:59] <luqui> but to clarify things more (or perhaps muddy them up)

[15:59] <luqui> List is what Larry is calling theory.pod's Tuple

[15:59] <Juerd> I think it's great if a list cannot be referenced or stored directly.

[15:59] <luqui> so it has a little bit more structure than an array has

[15:59] <Juerd> Ahh, that explains things.

[15:59] <Juerd> Then "List" is an even much worse name.

[16:00] <Juerd> Or list context needs renaming.

[16:00] <luqui> the latter is quite possible

[16:00] <luqui> "flattening context" may be better

[16:00] <Juerd> I still quite like singular vs plural

[16:00] <luqui> as context names

[16:00] <Juerd> Then flat context, please :)

[16:00] <luqui> ?

[16:00] <Juerd> flattening is too much typing ;)

[16:01] <Juerd> Yes, as context names.

[16:01] <luqui> you wouldn't have to type it

[16:01] <luqui> you type it as *

[16:01] <Juerd> In code, sure.

[16:01] <Juerd> But think of IRC, Perl Monks, usenet.

[16:01] <Juerd> :)

[16:01] <luqui> heh

[16:01] <Juerd> I like that Perl has nice, short jargon.

[16:01] <luqui> singular vs. plural is pretty good too, though

[16:01] <Juerd> And that's the main argument against singular vs plural too.

[16:01] <Juerd> singular is too long :)

[16:02] <luqui> I'm rather irked by "form" and "part", however, but for the most part I agree

[16:02] <Juerd> But item versus plural is assymmetric

[16:02] <Juerd> part should be group anyway...

[16:02] <Juerd> What does form do again?

[16:03] <luqui> group's pretty good.  I don't see the problem with "partition".  It's not like this is an extremely common combinator

[16:03] <luqui> form is from Perl6::Form, the formatting module

[16:03] <luqui> two more letters and it suddenly makes sense

[16:03] <Juerd> Partition, as a verb, feels weird to me as a non-native speaker.

[16:03] <Juerd> I've never used it.

[16:03] <luqui> oh.  well, I have..

[16:03] <Juerd> Oh, form is a stupid name indeed. Format++

[16:04] <Juerd> I hadn't considered the module, as it's, well, a module :)

[16:04] <luqui> yeah.  I don't really care, as I'll never use it

[16:04] <Juerd> But I'd like part to be group, personally.

[16:04] <luqui> something about Damian's interfaces really bug me

[16:05] <Juerd> I will use it, but wouldn't dislike Perl6::Form::form even, because I don't use it more than once per year.

[16:05] * Juerd has actually used Text::Reform last week.

[16:05] <Juerd> Much to my own surprise too.

[16:05] <Juerd> Can you define what bugs you?

[16:06] <Juerd> I think they abuse arrays and hashes too much. (i.e. give them special meaning and thus turn [] and {} into non-array and non-hash syntax)

[16:06] <luqui> well, they're made to be "dwimmy", but I always, always, have to go to the documentation to use them

[16:07] <luqui> and sift through pages of special cases to find out if the thing I'm passing it will be interpreted specially

[16:07] <Juerd> So do I, but that's mostly because I don't use it often enough.

[16:07] <luqui> well, I've used Parse::RecDescent in more than ten different places (rough estimate), and I still have to use the docs a lot

[16:07] <Juerd> And yes, it would be nice to also have concise reference documentation in addition to the tutorial-like prose.

[16:08] <Juerd> That, again, has to do with weird syntax :)

[16:08] <luqui> and yet, I've only used parsec once, and I'm already documentation free

[16:08] <Juerd> Syntax mustn't be too free-form.

[16:08] <luqui> and forget about Text::Balanced

[16:09] <luqui> quite awkward indeed

[16:09] <Juerd> T::B uses $&, which doesn't feel right, even though it is optimized now.

[16:09] <luqui> well, the whole "in scalar context, it changes the string, but only when it's a reference, and only if you're not an Aquarius"

[16:10] <Juerd> I had a constant stream of mixed feelings while reading PBP. A totally new experience for me.

[16:10] <Juerd> Heh.

[16:10] <luqui> "in list context, it returns a list of these five hundred things, the 313th and the 27th of which you will actually need"

[16:10] <Juerd> Let's hope boolean named arguments will quickly spread as the much better practice. :)

[16:10] * luqui hopes so

[16:11] <Juerd> Damian's interfaces are /complete/ though. It's hard to find something he hasn't obviously thought about.

[16:11] <luqui> that's true

[16:11] <luqui> his modules do *everything* in the domain

[16:11] <Juerd> Yep

[16:11] <luqui> so I guess it's hard to pack all of that into a concise interface

[16:12] <Juerd> Hard, but not impossible.

[16:12] <Juerd> But it may require words. 

[16:12] <Juerd> And words are scary. Or something.

[16:12] <luqui> which he is opposed to :-)

[16:12] <luqui> anyway, time for a shower, to go to school, and to stop ripping on Damian's excellent modules

[16:13] * luqui &

[16:14] <Juerd> Bye

[16:14] <Juerd> Have fun at school.

[16:15] * Juerd always finds it hard to imagine what intelligent people do in school... :)

[16:15] <luqui> work our asses off writing essays about the Russian Revolution to appease the particular professor's tastes

[16:16] <luqui> oh, thanks

[16:16] * luqui &

[16:18] <rafl> Juerd: Usually nothing. At least in my experice. :-)

[16:20] <Juerd> My current vision is that school is there to help people learn, and thus unnecessary if you are already able to discover new things by yourself.

[16:20] <Juerd> This very probably has to do with my own lack of education, but that doesn't really challenge the statement.

[16:23] <integral> Juerd: one useful thing it offers is access to professors/readers/lecturers/researchers who have used the stuff a lot.

[16:24] <Juerd> Yes, that is nice.

[16:24] <Juerd> Should be possible without the organized education attached to it, though.

[16:25] <integral> the organization helps pay them...

[16:25] <Juerd> Invent subscriptions

[16:26] <integral> there's all the people who complain the journals are subscription based :-/

[16:26] <Juerd> I think it's natural to pay to see someone speak.

[16:27] <Juerd> And subscriptions are the only low-cost way to enable that over longer terms.

[16:28] <integral> hmm, and it's possibly natural to group several speakers together, and organised several week's worth of lectures from them; then to organise some question handouts,  and then at the end the opportunity to get a certificate of participation...

[16:28] <Juerd> On the matter of not-paying, though, I really really really hate that the LPW overlaps with something I had already planned to attend.

[16:28] <Juerd> What would you nead a certificate of participation for?

[16:29] <Juerd> I'd be there for the knowledge and wisdom, not pride or proof.

[16:29] <integral> to prove to an employer that you've gone and gathered some wisdom...

[16:29] <Juerd> Oh, right. Employers.

[16:29] <Juerd> Haven't been in that situation yet, unfortunately.

[16:30] <integral> Oh, or we could just let the state pay us, comrade...

[16:30] <Juerd> That would be best, of course, but it might severely decrease the quality.

[16:31] <rafl> Juerd: You can attend to the next GPW!

[16:31] <rafl> Juerd: It even isn't that far than last year for you.

[16:31] <Juerd> Where will it be held?

[16:31] <Juerd> And when?

[16:32] <rafl> Juerd: perlworkshop.de

[16:32] <rafl> Juerd: I hope you speak some german. The page is only partially translated.

[16:32] <Juerd> Ah, should have googled.

[16:33] <Juerd> I can read German.

[16:33] <Juerd> Not speak, but that shouldn't be necessary for browsing a site :)

[16:33] <rafl> Fine.

[16:33] <rafl> Indeed.

[16:33] <Juerd> Weiter ist der Deutsche Perl-Workshop für Teilnehmer sehr kostengünstig.

[16:33] <Juerd> Do you happen to know exactly how kostenguenstig it will be? :)

[16:33] <Juerd> Or roughly

[16:34] <Juerd> Is last year's fee a good indication?

[16:34] <rafl> Juerd: Here's Bochum, btw: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bochum

[16:35] <rafl> Juerd: afaik around 50EUR.

[16:35] <rafl> Juerd: Not sure though. That's maybe the students price.

[16:35] <Juerd> I'm a student, officially.

[16:36] <rafl> Juerd: Then it's definitly not more than 50EUR. Maybe less.

[16:36] <Juerd> I'm not motivated or doing anything about it, but I am registered with the dutch open university.

[16:36] <Juerd> Since a few months.

[16:36] <Juerd> Oh, that's reasonably west, so certainly drivable.

[16:37] <Juerd> I can be there in 2 hours

[16:37] <Juerd> I could even sleep at home :)

[16:37] <rafl> Juerd: Great, I need some place to sleep ;-)

[16:37] <Juerd> Haha

[16:37] <Juerd> That would be weird.

[16:38] <Juerd> Attend a conference *in another country* and sleep in your own... :)

[16:39] <rafl> Juerd: You might also want to attend at the next Chemnitzer Linux Days. It's just after the Perl workshop (sat,sun). iblech want's to give a Perl 6 talk there.

[16:39] <Juerd> Hmmm

[16:40] <Juerd> Interesting

[16:40] <rafl> And even cooler things like a Debian Day, that I'm forced to organize.

[16:40] <rafl> I also have a warm place to rest for you as I live in Chemnitz.

[16:40] <Juerd> Where is Chemnitz?

[16:41] <rafl> Quite in the east of Germany. http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemnitz

[16:42] <rafl> autrijus: Maybe you want to join as well when you're in Germany for the GPW anyway? :-)

[16:42] <Juerd> Oh, that's very east.

[16:42] <rafl> Juerd: Well, still drivable.

[16:43] <Juerd> 5 hours!

[16:43] <rafl> Even by bike. I will probably do that.

[16:43] <Juerd> But, I guess, doable.

[16:43] <Juerd> What kind of "bike"?

[16:44] <Juerd> Motorcycle, or human powered?

[16:44] <rafl> Juerd: Not sure yet. Depends on the weather. A racing bike or an mountain bike.

[16:44] <rafl> Juerd: A human powered, of course. :-)

[16:44] <Juerd> 500 km by bicycle...

[16:44] <Juerd> In 1 day?

[16:45] <rafl> And a night.

[16:46] <Juerd> ...

[16:46] <Juerd> That's, ehm, tough. :)

[16:46] <Juerd> My max is 100 a day. And then I'm dead.

[16:46] <rafl> Juerd: I actually like long bike trips. Fichtelberg - Kap Arkona for example (~600km)

[16:46] <Juerd> And that's in .nl, so the flattest immaginable.

[16:47] <Juerd> Hm, and not long after this Chemnitz thing, there's Cebit, that I'd like to visit anyway.

[16:48] <Juerd> I could consider a longer stay in Germany.

[16:48] <Juerd> How's Germany for nature camping?

[16:48] <rafl> Juerd: biking in .nl isn't that cool. To breezy. If I climb up a mountain I can proudly say that I climbed it up, but always cycling against the wind isn't cool, imho.

[16:49] <rafl> Juerd: Camping is fine. And for the Linux Day I can even offer indoor camping

[16:49] <Juerd> Believe me, wind conquering pride does exist here. Every day when I cycled home. :)

[16:49] <Juerd> I don't know if pitching a tent indoors is a great idea :)

[16:49] <Juerd> But then, the tent isn't really necessary even :)

[16:50] <rafl> You don't even need a tent. Cool, eh? :-)

[16:50] <Juerd> I like the idea of going to Germany next March, and staying there a while.

[16:51] <Juerd> It'll depend on financial resources, though.

[16:51] <rafl> Juerd: I'd be happy

[16:51] <Juerd> There's another thing in Germany, in December, that I'm probably not going to, because I'm short on cash.

[16:51] <rafl> What other thing?

[16:51] <Juerd> CCC conference

[16:52] <rafl> I'll be there as well. But it's expensive, yes.

[16:52] <Juerd> I promised some people I'd be there, but it's expensive, my car doesn't run on rain water, and any place to stay is also expensive.

[16:52] <Juerd> I hate camping out in winter, so that's not an option.

[16:53] <rafl> Juerd: I have a cheap place for you to stay in Berlin. Several even.

[16:53] <Juerd> Tell me more :)

[16:53] <rafl> At a friend of mine, Sven Guckes.

[16:54] <Juerd> I recognise the name, but have no idea where I saw it before.

[16:55] <rafl> Maybe in context with vim or screen. He has a command line fetish (like I have).

[16:55] <rafl> Or mutt-ng or the grml live distro

[16:55] <Juerd> I use vim and screen, so that could be it.

[16:55] <Juerd> Command line fetishes are good.

[16:55] <rafl> Indeed.

[16:55] <Juerd> Though I admit slowly getting to like konqueror as a file manager

[16:56] <Juerd> Its kpartview doesn't quite beat du -ch

[16:56] <Juerd> Eh, the reverse of that.

[16:56] <Juerd> du -ch doesn't quite beat kpartview.

[16:58] <rafl> I still prefer it over a GUI tool.

[17:00] <Juerd> Hm, FOSDEM is just before the GPW

[17:00] <Juerd> This keeps looking better.

[17:00] <Juerd> It could be a west european geek tour :)

[17:01] <rafl> I've never been to fosdem. What's special about it?

[17:02] <Juerd> I have no idea, but they will be offering LPIC-2 exams

[17:02] <Juerd> At reduced fees :)

[17:05] <rafl> Is there a linux event that doesn't do that?

[17:06] <rafl> I think you can also do that at the Chemnitzer LT.

[17:07] <Juerd> I see

[17:07] <Juerd> Still, the Geek Tour might be a nice idea.

[17:09] <rafl> Juerd: Will you drive from Chemnitz to Amsterdam and do you have two free seats? :-)

[17:10] <ingy> hola

[17:11] <xinming> Juerd: where is your personal site?

[17:14] <Juerd> rafl: Iff I'm stupid enough to do this, I probably will.

[17:14] <Juerd> xinming: Guess.

[17:15] <xinming> juerd.com doesn't work. :-/ I lost the history. :-/

[17:15] <rafl> Juerd: I'd be stupid enough and the fellow student beside me as well.

[17:15] <Juerd> xinming: Your internet connection is broken. Juerd.com does workforme.

[17:16] <Juerd> rafl: It all mostly depends on how rich I will be by then.

[17:16] <xinming> <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"><html><head><title></title></head><body></body></html>

[17:16] <xinming> Juerd: That's only page I got using Juerd.com

[17:16] <Juerd> rafl: I have to be able to afford a few weeks without serious work, a lot of fuel, some conferences and places to stay.

[17:16] <rafl> Juerd: I can at least organize some places to sleep in Chemnitz and Bochum.

[17:17] <Juerd> rafl: That helps, yea

[17:17] <Juerd> xinming: Whatever - then try juerd.nl

[17:17] <Juerd> xinming: Still something is broken if juerd.com does not work.

[17:17] <rafl> Juerd: Well, maybe we could also cut it down a bit to be cheaper.

[17:19] <Juerd> Cut what down?

[17:19] <Juerd> Oh, fsck

[17:19] <Juerd> I have to be somewhere in 10 minutes

[17:19] <Juerd> Will you be around later tonight?

[17:20] * Juerd runs off

[17:20] <Juerd> afk

[17:24] <rafl> Juerd: Yes, I will.

[17:24] <rafl> Juerd: Cut the trip down. Drop some events.

[17:52] <integral> hmm, I wonder if threads are working enough to work around the blocking issue in svnbot

[18:13] <pmurias> Is there a TODO for pugs?

[18:24] <Su-Shee> Hi.

[18:24] <geoffb> pmurias, not as such.  There are a few things that hit part of the issue, though:

[18:24] <dduncan> hi

[18:24] <geoffb> 1) tests.  These are filled with todos

[18:25] <geoffb> 2) The 2*PI timeline.  Long scale todos

[18:25] <geoffb> 3) STATUS (probably not completely up to date), has areas of incompletion and current work

[18:25] <geoffb> 4) AES (mostly S) -- these all have to be implemented

[18:26] <geoffb> Probably more, but my brain is not fully engaged this morning

[18:26] <Limbic_Region> pmurias - are you looking to see what is left to be done or looking to see what you can do to help

[18:27] <Limbic_Region> there will be an intersection between the two lists - but they won't be identical

[18:47] <Juerd> re

[18:47] <Juerd> rafl: Oh, of course :)

[18:50] <rafl> Juerd: Simply keep me informed about your plans so we can probably meet.

[18:51] <Juerd> Oh, that'll probably happen anyway, sooner or later.

[18:51] <rafl> Uhm, where?

[18:51] <Juerd> Time will tell

[18:51] <Juerd> Possibly as soon as CCC.

[18:52] <rafl> OK, if you need something to sleep there simply tell me.

[18:52] <rafl> And do that soon.

[18:52] <Juerd> I have one client, who owes me a few thousand euros. However, they're allowed, by exceptional contract, to wait until January.

[18:53] <Juerd> rafl: In any case, if I'm coming to CCC, I'll be gone as soon as dec 30, because a big party is thrown for my dad, who will be 60 the next day.

[18:54] <rafl> Juerd: I think I'll also miss one day. Not sure which, though.

[18:54] * rafl changes locations. See you..

[18:54] <Juerd> Bye

[19:04] <pmurias> Limbic_Region: the second one

[19:06] <Limbic_Region> pmurias - there is plenty you can do

[19:06] <Limbic_Region> do you already know Haskell?

[19:08] <Limbic_Region> Pugs is a p6 parser/compile that targets a handful of backends - Haskell, Perl5, JavaScript, and Parrot

[19:08] <Limbic_Region> all of those areas need work

[19:09] <Limbic_Region> if you want something a bit more introductory - you can always write p6 code for example contributions and when it doesn't work - write tests 

[19:10] <Limbic_Region> what level of involvement were you looking for?

[19:17] <pmurias> I read the Haskell school of expresion and a bit of other haskell stuff, but would like to do something wich would allow me to learn Haskell for real

[19:20] <Limbic_Region> oh, well then perhaps you should check out autrijus' tutorial on the matter

[19:20] <Limbic_Region> http://pugscode.org/euroscon/haskell.xul

[19:21] <Limbic_Region> http://www.haskell.org/learning.html # also has several tutorials

[19:22] <Limbic_Region> autrijus' presentation likely won't help you learn Haskell unless he is actually presenting it

[19:24] <Juerd> In which case you get instant understanding of large parts of the universe.

[19:25] * Limbic_Region didn't know autrijus was into string or m-theory

[19:26] <geoffb> large parts, not small parts

[19:27] <Limbic_Region> geoffb - I didn't say quantum or relativity - string/m-theory is a GUT so large parts apply

[19:28] <Limbic_Region> </silliness>

[19:28] <pmurias> I was more looking for a medium/easy task which would allow me to see how thinks work out in pugs and haskell in general (and perhaps do something usefull) rather the haskell syntax(I read the Haskell Report for those) 

[19:29] <Limbic_Region> pmurias - my suggestion would be to find someone doing something you are vaguely interested in and ask them for specific guidance

[19:29] <Limbic_Region> most people here have pet projects

[19:30] <Su-Shee> Limbic_Region: Who's the petholder for "documentation"?

[19:31] <Juerd> Several people. It depends on the kind of documentation you're after.

[19:31] <pmurias> Limbic_Region: Is there a (hopefully) a list of those?

[19:32] <Su-Shee> Juerd: I'd like to participate in some way. And as I'm a journalist, writing stuff comes in mind. What kind is _needed_? 

[19:32] <Limbic_Region> pmurias - it is unusually quiet here ATM, but usually the regulars are chatting about whatever it is they are working on

[19:33] <Limbic_Region> pmurias - if you haven't checked the commit log - that might be a good place to start

[19:33] <Juerd> Su-Shee: All kinds.

[19:33] <Juerd> Su-Shee: For example, there is no reference documentation for Perl 6 yet.

[19:34] <Juerd> Su-Shee: And there's the quickref subproject, that still needs more concisely packed info.

[19:34] <Limbic_Region> Juerd - is there a p6doc yet - I seem to recall that there is but I am not sure

[19:34] <Su-Shee> Juerd: The quickref I use right now to learn.

[19:34] <pmurias> don't the synopsis count as reference documentation?

[19:34] <Juerd> Su-Shee: It'd also be great if you could think of great answers for the fears subproject.

[19:35] <Juerd> pmurias: I mean a perldoc like thing. Something a programmer can use to look up how the language works. 

[19:35] <Juerd> pmurias: Synopses describe changes since Perl 5 mostly.

[19:35] <Juerd> Limbic_Region: I have no idea.

[19:35] <Juerd> pmurias: We need documentation that is purely Perl 6, in very consistent Perl 6 jargon.

[19:36] <Juerd> pmurias: Which is structured, and has a fixed layout within that structure.

[19:37] <Su-Shee> Ok, I can see that the problem is not that there isn't enough to write. ;)

[19:39] <Juerd> Certainly not :)

[19:39] <fglock> rehi

[19:39] <Juerd> If you feel like it, start writing and don't forget to commit often

[19:39] <pmurias> Is one allowed to use synopses as a base for reference documentation (I haven't seen a licence on them)

[19:40] <Juerd> pmurias: I think so, but I don't think it makes a good basis.

[19:41] <Su-Shee> I may ask for details around here? 

[19:46] <Juerd> Always

[19:47] <obra> pmurias: when you do that, credit it? just so it can be dealt with later if need be?

[20:00] <meppl> youre coding a java-script-compiler?

[20:00] <meppl> --

[20:04] <meppl> Mit der Version 6.2.8 haben sich die Ziele des Projektes leicht ge􏿽xE4ndert. Pugs soll ein vollst􏿽xE4ndiger Perl 6-Compiler werden, der Perl 6 nach Parrot (PIR), Haskell oder Perl 5 und weiteren Sprachen, z.B. JavaScript, 􏿽xFCbersetzen kann.

[20:04] <meppl> hm

[20:04] <meppl> sry

[20:08] <Su-Shee> Wow. I'm impressed. Every crazy idea I try without documentation works as I expect. :)

[20:21] <Limbic_Region> Su-Shee are you aware of the evalbot?

[20:22] <Su-Shee> Limbic_Region: No?

[20:22] <Limbic_Region> ?eval my @foo = 1..100; @foo[47]

[20:22] *** evalbot_7978 is now known as evalbot_7981

[20:22] <evalbot_7981> \48 

[20:22] <Limbic_Region> ?my $choice = any(1..100); $choice.pick

[20:23] <Su-Shee> Fancy. :) Is it saved afterwards if it works?

[20:23] <Limbic_Region> ?eval my $choice = any(1..100); $choice.pick

[20:23] <evalbot_7981> 10 

[20:23] <Limbic_Region> saved?

[20:23] <Su-Shee> Yes. If it works the bot might save it as example, test or something like this.

[20:24] <Limbic_Region> not that I know of and I doubt it

[20:24] <Limbic_Region> the source code is in the pugs repository fwiw

[20:26] <Su-Shee> I just have the pugs from CPAN right now. 

[20:26] <Su-Shee> I didn't expect that so much is working already.

[20:26] <Limbic_Region> not sure why the Pugs from CPAN would be any different

[20:27] <Limbic_Region> but if you need to browse the trunk repository you can

[20:27] <Limbic_Region> http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/

[20:27] <wolverian> any recommendations for a free (as in beer or freedom) licensed UML editor for linux that doesn't suck?

[20:27] <Limbic_Region> http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/examples/network/evalbot/

[20:28] <Su-Shee> Limbic_Region: tnx. 

[20:28] <Limbic_Region> wolverian - using "free UML editor" at google appears to give some promising results

[20:29] <wolverian> Limbic_Region, thanks. I'm looking at argouml right now. 

[20:37] <GeJ> wolverian: you can also try poseidon. It started as a fork of argouml but has grown pretty well lately. They have a community edition (or something like that) that is free as in beer.

[20:47] <Su-Shee> Hm. For testing the rules I need parrot? 

[20:47] <Limbic_Region> yes, PGE hasn't been ported to p6 *yet*

[20:47] <Su-Shee> Ok.

[20:48] <Su-Shee> Well, this looks like a new edition of "mastering regular expressions" ... ;)

[20:50] <Limbic_Region> well - p6 rules are called rules cause they aren't regular expressions anymore

[20:50] <Limbic_Region> well - that's probably not the only or even the main reason, but it does apply

[20:51] <Su-Shee> I just took a glance and saw "Ok, _this_ looks different.." 

[20:51] <xinming> I don't think regexp will be dead even we have got rule. :-)

[20:53] <Su-Shee> As I actually don't know what I can exactly do and don't with the rules..

[20:54] <pmurias> Juerd: I sent my request for an account on feather my email,by new account isn't tested much so if you don't get it,please irc to me.

[20:55] <xinming> Su-Shee: hmm, IMHO, rule is much more powerful than regexp. But regexp is more expressive in simple case.

[20:55] <Limbic_Region> xinming - you are correct, rules encompass regexen but also a whole lot more

[21:00] <wolverian> GeJ, poseidon is nice, yes, and I have a license for it, but it is just too much of a memory hog.

[21:00] <wolverian> GeJ, it does not run nicely on 256mb ram :)

[21:05] <GeJ> nod nod... I have the same issue at work. have to use it on my station, useless on the laptop

[21:05] <Su-Shee> And here we go with the rules. 

[21:06] <wolverian> argouml runs okay, but it doesn't do automatic layout

[21:07] <wolverian> well, it does, but it just puts the classes side by side with no regard whatsoever to the connections

[21:07] <wolverian> worse than useless

[21:07] <Juerd> pmurias: After a comma should be whitespace :)

[21:11] <geoffb> It weirds me out, somehow, that most of the English usage and syntax correction comes from people who are not native English speakers . . . while those of us who are native just subconsciously error-correct and don't even notice anything was wrong.

[21:12] <geoffb> Barring, of course, my $spouse, who is *constantly* correcting typos in ads, much to my annoyance.  :-)

[21:12] <PerlJam> geoffb: The native english speakers are also the ones making the majority of the mistakes :)

[21:12] <geoffb> LOL, well, possibly true.

[21:15] <Su-Shee> at least you hadn't have a new version of spelling... 

[21:15] * Odin-LAP also spots and points out typos in Icelandic.

[21:15] <Odin-LAP> So it's really not so much to do with having to think consciously about it, as it is a personality flaw. ;)

[21:15] <geoffb> Odin-LAP, heh

[21:16] <geoffb> Su-Shee, ?

[21:16] <Su-Shee> I see it in foreign texts but not in mine. ;)

[21:16] <geoffb> ah

[21:16] <Su-Shee> geoffb: I'm suffering from a spelling reform in Germany as a journalist, because no it depends on the magazine what kind of spelling is used. ;)

[21:17] <Su-Shee> And as german spelling always was _that_ easy.. ;)

[21:17] <geoffb> bleh

[21:17] <Juerd> geoffb: Eh, interpunction like this is not at all specific to English.

[21:17] <Juerd> geoffb: And I do correct Dutch, my native language, too.

[21:17] <geoffb> Juerd, true -- your correction made me think about the general trend

[21:17] <Odin-LAP> Oooh. Kind of like here. They dropped "z" around thirty years ago. One of the newspapers still hasn't heard about that...

[21:18] <Juerd> Odin-LAP: haven't

[21:18] <geoffb> Su-Shee, is it true as I have heard that German is attempting to go to pure ASCII spelling?  Or will there still be Latin-1 characters used, even in "reformed" spellings?

[21:19] <Odin-LAP> O_o

[21:19] <Odin-LAP> Why the hell would they even want that? English is a mess because of doing precisely that. ;)

[21:19] <Odin-LAP> ("Orthography? What's that?")

[21:19] <Juerd> Ja, umlaut-frei Deutsch! Das waere toll!

[21:19] <Odin-LAP> Aieee!

[21:19] * Odin-LAP runs to the hills.

[21:19] <geoffb> Juerd, so perhaps native English speakers simply care less about precision . . . .

[21:20] * geoffb shrugs

[21:20] <Juerd> geoffb: Would you care about whitespace within ellipses being ultimately weird?

[21:20] <Su-Shee> geoffb: pure Ascii?! :)) no, there are still the german umlauts, but the reformed (we call it deformed ;) spelling spells words of greek origin now in a more "aesy" way. (ugly way ;)

[21:20] <Odin-LAP> æ!

[21:20] <geoffb> I dunno, Odin-LAP, I just heard that somewhere, I have no knowledge of the truth of it

[21:20] <geoffb> Su-Shee, ah.

[21:21] <geoffb> Juerd, old habits die hard.

[21:21] * geoffb learned touch typing on manual typewriters

[21:21] <Juerd> geoffb: Think about the lifetime of your spacebar! You could prolong it by CENTURIES!

[21:21] <Su-Shee> geoffb: "philosoph" (old) -> "filosof" (new) 

[21:21] <Juerd> Well, days, perhaps, but still.

[21:21] <geoffb> Juerd, heh

[21:21] <geoffb> Su-Shee, oh dear.  Mark Twain strikes back.

[21:21] <Odin-LAP> Su-Shee: Orthography.

[21:22] <Odin-LAP> Which, incidentally, is a concept the english-speaking world seems not to comprehend.

[21:22] <Su-Shee> geoffb: Well, the first thing _everyone_ would have changed has been the upper and lower case thing in german.. but no.. let's do some fancy utterly useless seplling stuff. ;)

[21:22] <geoffb> .oO( For a deeply technical channel, we do seem to discuss human languages and their foibles an awful lot. )

[21:22] * Odin-LAP still hasn't found a language with worse orthography. That includes french.

[21:22] <geoffb> Su-Shee, NODNODNOD

[21:22] <PerlJam> geoffb: well ... Larry *is* a linguist

[21:23] <PerlJam> geoffb: and such tendencies run deep on perldom

[21:23] <PerlJam> s/on/in/

[21:23] <Odin-LAP> And every other perler is an amateur linguist.

[21:23] <Odin-LAP> Or so it would seem.

[21:23] <geoffb> PerlJam, but he has never been in here, so far as I know.

[21:23] <geoffb> Odin-LAP, now *that* I would believe.

[21:24] <Su-Shee> Odin-LAP: Worse than german? 

[21:24] * geoffb switches from one-look.com to Google define:, thereby contributing to the borgification of virtuality

[21:26] <Odin-LAP> Su-Shee: Deutsche Orthografie ist viel besser als Englisch. :>

[21:26] <Su-Shee> Odin-LAP: :))

[21:27] <Su-Shee> Well, I liked chinese. Not our idea of "orthography" ;)

[21:27] <Odin-LAP> Not exactly, no.

[21:27] <Odin-LAP> Non-alphabetic languages don't really qualify... :p

[21:27] <Su-Shee> And a very nice grammar. ;) 

[21:28] <Odin-LAP> Hm. Don't know much about that.

[21:28] <Juerd> Odin-LAP: Does your shift key wear out quickly?

[21:28] <Odin-LAP> Juerd: Hm? Whaddya mean?

[21:28] <Juerd> Odin-LAP: Nouns.

[21:28] <Su-Shee> Odin-LAP: Well, it's actually rather short as chinese does not know about gender, tenses, numerals, cases, flection of verbs.. :)

[21:28] <geoffb> Juerd, good thing keyboards come with two . . . 

[21:29] <Odin-LAP> Juerd: Dunno. I don't do that much typing in German. :>

[21:29] <Juerd> Odin-LAP: Oh, heh :)

[21:29] <Juerd> geoffb: Hehe<ws>.<ws>.<ws>. :)

[21:29] <geoffb> ROFL

[21:29] <geoffb> OK, I deserved that

[21:30] <Juerd> Everyone deserves a mirror :)

[21:31] <Juerd> Now I remember where I saw that weird interpunctual whitespace before!

[21:31] <Juerd> MS-DOS!

[21:31] <geoffb> OK, I'll use the Unicode then…

[21:31] <geoffb> The problem is, it's damn near invisible in a fixed-width font

[21:31] <Juerd> Yea.

[21:31] <Odin-LAP> Indeed.

[21:31] <Juerd> I prefer ASCII ... too.

[21:32] * Odin-LAP likes the LaTeX version. :)

[21:32] <Juerd> Though not . . ., and especially not with whitespace before or after.

[21:32] * geoffb chuckles at the Unicode notes for HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS:

[21:32] <geoffb> Approximate equivalents:

[21:32] <geoffb>  • U+002E FULL STOP U+002E FULL STOP U+002E FULL STOP

[21:34] <Su-Shee> Hm. what is the most simple rule that has to work? I always get an error of PGE.

[21:34] <Juerd> Su-Shee: /foo/

[21:34] <Juerd> That has to match foo.

[21:35] <Juerd> And not match non-foo.

[21:35] <Juerd> Sometimes I wish all life was this simple :)

[21:37] <Su-Shee> Hm. I tried my $foo = "barfoobaz"; $m = $foo ~~ /foo/;

[21:38] <PerlJam> Su-Shee: What's the error that you get?

[21:39] <Su-Shee> *** Cannot parse PGE:  foo

[21:39] <Su-Shee> *** Error: No such attribute '%:capt'

[21:40] <pmurias>  Juerd: did you get my email

[21:40] <pmurias> ?

[21:41] <geoffb> Grrrrr ... insert websites-with-tiny-fonts-that-don't-scale-with-ctrl-+ rant here ...

[21:49] <Juerd> pmurias: Yes. Did you get mine?

[21:49] <Juerd> geoffb: Minimum font size is a setting.

[21:51] <pmurias> Juerd: nope

[21:52] <geoffb> Juerd, I was referring to sites that space everything at fixed pixel locations that work (sortof) with their default 8 pixel high font, but basically become an unreadable mess if you increase the font size ... min size wouldn't help that

[21:52] <Juerd> geoffb: Ah.

[21:52] <Juerd> pmurias: Fix that then :)

[21:52] <Juerd> pmurias: 553 5.3.5 xdsl-1122.zgora.dialog.net.pl. config error: mail loops back to me (MX problem?)

[22:00] <pmurias> Juerd: I'll try to fix it tomorow, I've got to get to sleep now.
