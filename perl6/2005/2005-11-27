[09:29] <nothingmuch> autrijus: FYI - i released Term::VT102::Boundless

[09:30] <nothingmuch> IMHO HTML::FromANSI should use it

[09:30] <nothingmuch> that way it doesn't have to guess rows/cols

[09:51] <perlbot> Paste your code and #perl will be able to view it: http://sial.org/pbot/perl http://dragon.cbi.tamucc.edu:8080 http://erxz.com/pb

[09:51] <Khisanth> hmm

[09:52] <azuroth> aha

[09:52] <Khisanth> add a 6 to the end of that first address

[10:01] <r0nny> morning

[10:01] <azuroth> hey hey

[10:45] *** brentp is now known as _brentp

[10:46] <r0nny> yo

[10:46] <r0nny> i got problem 

[10:46] <azuroth> with what?

[10:46] <r0nny> want to use YAML::Dump to dump a perl6 data structure

[10:47] <r0nny> but it just tells there isnt such a sub

[10:48] <r0nny> is there a way, to use perl5 data structures for this hash ?

[10:48] <azuroth> hmm. I've no idea

[12:17] *** kgftr|ko1obi is now known as kgtfr|konobi

[17:03] <herentia> does anyone see the syntax error in this line if ( grep (/ball/, $mech->field) )

[17:36] <sky_> autrijus: http://www.couchsurfing.com/

[17:54] <r0nny> re

[19:03] <Aankhen``> G'night.

[19:10] <gaal> herentia: in Perl 6? $mech.field . But were you looking for #perl ?

[19:25] <revdiablo> Perl 6's grep doesn't take EXPR form either, does it?

[19:26] <integral> nothing should now

[19:26] <revdiablo> $mech.field.grep:{/ball/}; # IIRC

[19:26] <integral> since blocks are very, very, very trivial...

[19:26] <revdiablo> Does field return a list either?

[19:26] <revdiablo> So much to talk about in such a simple snippet of code.

[19:27] <wolverian> revdiablo, .field certainly returns a list if it's declared as such (has @.field;)

[19:27] <revdiablo> Is it declared as such, was my question

[19:28] <wolverian> it's not a built-in or anything. it's just an example (AFAIK)

[19:28] <revdiablo> I assumed we were talking about a WWW::Mechanize object, since it was named $mech and 'field' makes sense in that context

[19:28] <wolverian> oh, okay. I don't know about any possible WWW::Mechanize perl6 implementation.

[19:29] <wolverian> (or the perl5 one either, really. :)

[19:29] <revdiablo> Yeah I think his question was really intended for #perl, but hey, why not run with it. =)

[19:30] <wolverian> ah, I didn't read that up :)

[19:31] <wolverian> s,up,far up

[19:32] <malverian> autrijus: Query me if you don't mind when you get a chance. I've got a question regarding cross-compiling to win32 host with pp

[19:38] <nothingmuch> autrijus: http://par.perl.org/ - is that broken?

[19:43] *** _SamB_ is now known as SamB

[20:01] <herentia> can someone show me what is wrong with the above code http://sial.org/pbot/14586

[21:09] <wolverian> it's been pretty quiet lately

[21:09] <wolverian> lack of autrijus? :)

[21:10] <geoffb> That'd be my guess.

[21:10] <geoffb> He's an effective neutron moderator.

[21:10] <wolverian> we should have more of those

[21:12] <geoffb> We do; unfortunately, most of them can't be around all the time, or even very much, like autrijus ... er ... used to.

[21:12] <geoffb> (economic reality)--

[21:12] <wolverian> reality--

[21:14] <Odin-LAP> capitalism-- # Onwards to revolution!

[21:27] <geoffb> loop { $current = @political_structures.pick }

[21:29] <integral> $current = any(@political_structures); # just pick the one that works for what you need at the time

[21:36] <geoffb> $current = @political_structures.grep({ $_.workable }).any;  # What's the correct method-taking-block syntax these days, anyway?

[21:37] <wolverian> .foo: { ... } # larry wants this to work, not sure if it's canonical yet

[21:37] <geoffb> So when followed up by another chained method call, what then?

[21:37] <wolverian> no idea. :)

[21:38] <wolverian> I assume as if it was .foo({ ... }).bar

[21:38] <geoffb> Yeah, so did I, then realized I hadn't read the S recently . . . still, it's what people will expect from a simple mental model, so it should DWIM

[21:39] <wolverian> search for 'grep:' in http://svn.perl.org/perl6/doc/trunk/design/syn/S12.pod

[21:42] <geoffb> mmm, proper DWIMmery, that.

[21:42] <wolverian> yes

[21:43] <wolverian> I'm not sure why we still need : at all then.. 

[21:43] <wolverian> probably to make grep { } @list work instead of grep { }, @list 

[21:43] <geoffb> Because Larry hates fingernail clippings

[21:43] <geoffb> nodnod

[21:43] <wolverian> I actually would be fine with giving up that feature

[21:43] <wolverian> not sure if many others would

[21:44] <nothingmuch> http://use.perl.org/~nothingmuch/journal/27757

[21:44] <geoffb> I think the : might be suboptimal, but I tend to make use of the fact that Perl is bluntly ( ) - optional, and use parens to mean something.

[21:45] <wolverian> perl is not () optional with method calls :/

[21:45] <wolverian> well, besides : .. right.

[21:46] <geoffb> and therein lies the rub

[21:46] <geoffb> go nothingmuch . . . .

[21:47] <wolverian> does $obj.foo<bar> call .foo("bar") or .foo(){"bar"}

[21:47] <nothingmuch> sri_: http://use.perl.org/~nothingmuch/journal/27757

[21:48] <geoffb> wolverian, I would just try it, but that would tell little about whether the Pugs behavior was correct or not.  :-)

[21:52] <wolverian> geoffb, right :)

[21:52] <nothingmuch> err, why did i post here
