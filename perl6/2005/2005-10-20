[00:00] <stevan_> this is borrow right from CLOS, Ruby, etc

[00:00] <stevan_> Class must be something right?

[00:00] <stevan_> unless you assume that Class springs forth from the runtime fully formed 

[00:01] <stevan_> However that means that Class is a mystery to the other elements of your system (unless you explicity expose its internals)

[00:01] <stevan_> if it helps,.. rename Class to Klass

[00:02] <stevan_> Klass is just a class which describes classes (hash of methods, hash of attributes, array of superclasses)

[00:03] <stevan_> if you create Klass, then you can bootstrap the rest of the system in

[00:03] <stevan_> its actually very simple once your remove the nomenclature baggage

[00:07] *** stevan_ is now known as stevan

[00:09] <stevan> Juerd: as for how a subclass can also be an instance,.. it is an instance of Class, which has the ability to have subclasses

[00:10] <stevan> think of the basis of the system as being an instance type, instead of a class

[00:11] <stevan> Juerd: the MiniMetaModel.pl in the docs/ dir of the Perl6-MetaModel might be helpful in explain this

[00:22] <stevan> Juerd: this might help too http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaobject

[00:28] *** mugwump is now known as samv

[00:28] *** samv is now known as mugwump

[07:14] <Aankhen``> Um... question: what is this "Pugs.cabal.in" file that util/build_pugs.pl uses, and where/how do I get it?

[07:18] <obra> you know what cabal is, yet?

[07:18] <Aankhen``> Not really.

[07:18] <obra> It's the Haskell makemaker equivalent

[07:18] <misc> something that doesn't exist ?

[07:18] <Aankhen``> Ah.

[07:18] <Aankhen``> Does this mean I'm going to have to download something?

[07:21] <integral> Aankhen``: Cabal comes with GHC.  Pugs.cabal.in is just a source file, it's in the pugs svn, and should be in pugs distributions

[07:21] <Aankhen``> Oh.

[07:22] <Aankhen``> In the root directory of the pugs/ tree?

[07:22] <integral> it's actually not the final file Cabal uses, that's Pugs.cabal

[07:22] <integral> Aankhen``: yep

[07:22] <Aankhen``> Strange, SVK doesn't seem to sync it for some reason...

[07:23] <integral> weird

[07:23] <Aankhen``> Hmm.

[07:24] <Aankhen``> Maybe I should just delete the entire local branch and create a new one. :-\

[07:26] <Aankhen``> Wha?  It's in the local branch, but it's not being pulled down.

[07:27] <Aankhen``> Neither is Pugs.sln

[07:27] <Aankhen``> Bleh.

[07:27] * Aankhen`` deletes the checkout dir and tries again.

[07:32] <Aankhen``> Cool, that worked.

[07:40] <Aankhen``> OK, Pugs still won't build.

[07:41] <Aankhen``> I am cursed.

[07:42] <pasteling> "Aankhen``" at 59.144.181.34 pasted "Build fails" (14 lines, 633B) at http://sial.org/pbot/13804

[07:42] <Aankhen``> (in case anyone's interested :-)

[07:49] <rafl> Aankhen``: What ghc version are you using?

[07:50] <Aankhen``> 6.4.1

[07:51] <rafl> No idea. Seems to be ghc-related, though.

[07:51] <Aankhen``> :-\

[07:51] <Aankhen``> I seem to be the only one with this problem.

[07:51] <Aankhen``> Anyway.

[07:51] <Aankhen``> BBL.

[09:09] *** |cnhackT| is now known as cnhackTNT

[10:39] <wolverian> is autrijus's Pugs slide 6/55 missing a [+] or so?

[10:42] <masak> wolverian: i count only 46 slides in "Introduction to Pugs"

[10:47] <wolverian> masak, pugs2.xul, that is

[10:48] <autrijus> yeah, it is.

[10:48] <wolverian> autrijus, in any case, nice presentation!

[10:48] <autrijus> thanks!

[10:48] <wolverian> autrijus, do you know if that @fib syntax is actually official yet? do we need to mark it lazy somehow?

[10:49] <autrijus> (@fib Y @fib[1...]).map(&infix:<+>)

[10:49] <autrijus> I think range is lazy by default, that's official

[10:49] <autrijus> and binding respects that too

[10:49] <wolverian> oh, right

[10:49] <wolverian> and [+] is syntax level so that's too eager here?

[10:50] <ods15> so... whats pugs? perl6's bug tracking system?...

[10:50] <autrijus> wolverian: no, [+] will yield one single value

[10:51] <wolverian> autrijus, oh, duh. sorry. 

[10:51] <wolverian> ods15, are you asking seriously? :)

[10:51] <ods15> wolverian: not atm, but i did when i first saw it

[10:52] <wolverian> ods15, ah. was it easy to learn what it really means?

[10:52] <ods15> uhhh...

[10:52] <ods15> what does it really mean

[10:53] <autrijus> Perl6 User's Golfing System

[10:53] <wolverian> ods15, it's the plural of a breed of dogs, obviously 

[10:53] <autrijus> but that's a backronym.

[10:53] <rafl> autrijus: Did someone do recordings of your talks?

[10:53] <rafl> Preferable video recordings. :-)

[10:53] <ods15> you should've called it ACME PUGS

[10:53] <autrijus> I'm going to present the haskell talk in... 30 mins

[10:54] <theorbtwo> ods15, I think Acme::'s goal is just to be fun.

[10:54] <theorbtwo> pugs is supposed to be fun and useful... with the emphasis on the fun.

[10:54] <ods15> wtf is Acme:: ?

[10:54] <rafl> autrijus: Turn on your laptops microphone during the talk! :-)

[10:55] <theorbtwo> Anyway, while pugs' primary author was previously well known for his work on a BTS, pugs isn't a BTS, and doesn't even use a formal BTS.

[10:55] <wolverian> ods15, CPAN's "fun" namespace

[10:56] <ods15> heh didnt know that

[10:56] <rafl> What's a BTS? I only know it as Bug Tracking System.

[10:56] <ods15> i was refferring to the cartoon mnopoly

[10:56] <ods15> rafl: thats exactly what he meant...

[10:56] <theorbtwo> Yeah, Bug Tracking System.  I was refering to RT.

[10:57] <theorbtwo> If you didn't know what Acme was, at least in that sense, then why did you think it should be ACME PUGS?

[10:57] <rafl> Ah, OK. Thought of the Debian BTS which is simply called 'BTS'.

[10:58] <ods15> theorbtwo: i was refferring to the cartoon mnopoly

[10:58] <ods15> anyway, nm, i'm just brainfarting.. bbl

[11:00] <theorbtwo> rafl: I think it's been named debbugs, but everybody in the debian world just assumes it's the one you mean when you say "the BTS".

[11:00] <rafl> Ah, right. The package for it is called debbugs.

[11:22] <pdcawley> Dunno.

[11:29] <nothingmuch> I agree!

[11:30] <wolverian> tentatively.

[11:39] <gaal> rafl, hi. 'pbuilder build' doesn't do anything on my box :/

[11:54] <rafl> gaal: Please show me its output.

[12:08] <gaal> rafl: no output at all. it returns to the prompt pretty quick

[12:08] <rafl> gaal: May I see the output of strace -f ?

[12:08] <gaal> sh -x show that it sourced some extra files, but then nada

[12:08] <gaal> sec

[12:11] <gaal> feather:~gaal/public_html/pbuilder.out

[12:13] <gaal> (i need the cvs version of ghc, not 6.4*)

[12:14] <rafl> Hm, maybe your pbuilderrc is broken? That's the last file that is read before it exits..

[12:15] <gaal> doesn't look broken...

[12:15] <gaal> i don't have to run this as root, do i?

[12:15] <gaal> either way it doesn't work

[12:16] <rafl> you do.

[12:16] <rafl> it uses chroot which normally gives you EPERM for non-root users.

[12:18] <gaal> same behavior when run as root.

[12:18] <rafl> Well, no idea. pure+reinstall?

[12:18] <rafl> What's yor commandline?

[12:18] <gaal> where does the local mirror get created?

[12:19] <gaal> pbuilder install ghc-cvs*dsc

[12:19] <gaal> er

[12:19] <gaal> s/install/build

[12:19] <rafl> Created a chroot before?

[12:19] <gaal> pbuilder create --mirror my_mirror

[12:19] <gaal> yes

[12:19] <rafl> pbuilder create --distribution=sid --mirror ... etc.

[12:19] <rafl> Hm, no idea then.

[12:19] <gaal> though that didn't say much either :)

[12:19] <rafl> The chroot is put into /var/cache/pbuilder/base.tgz.

[12:20] <rafl> Well, reportbug pbuilder

[12:20] <gaal> hmm, that doesn't exist. okay, purging as you suggest.

[12:20] <autrijus> yay

[12:20] <autrijus> talk over

[12:20] <gaal> whee

[12:20] <autrijus> well received

[12:21] <rafl> Recordings? :-P

[12:23] <autrijus> gugod: Spork::Formatter::Takahashi bah

[12:23] <autrijus> gugod: just take the resize algorithm in takahashi.js

[12:27] <gaal> http://pugscode.org/euroscon/haskell3.xul doesn't load?

[12:28] <gaal> hmm does now.

[12:41] <gaal> rafl: apt-get dist-upgrade seems to have helped: pbuilder create now does something :)

[12:51] <xinming> autrijus: 

[12:51] <xinming> http://pugscode.org/euroscon/haskell.xul

[12:51] <xinming> How do you made this? :-S

[12:51] <xinming> impressive...

[12:52] <gaal> xinming: view source and scroll down

[12:53] <xinming> gaal: hmm, I read that. But... I can't find the tags I know... - -b

[12:54] <xinming> <html> <head> </head> <body> </body> </html> that what I thought a web page must have... :-S

[12:55] <xinming> can't open in IE. :-P

[12:55] <brother> xinming: but it isn't html

[12:56] <xinming> can be rendered in Firefox. But not in IE. for IE, it will ask you the location to save... :-(

[12:56] <gaal> xinming: it's XUL, you have to use mozilla or ff

[12:56] <xinming> gaal: Oh, Ok, I think I understand.

[12:56] <kgftr|konobi> gaal: sounds like there isn't a <? XML declaration at the top

[12:57] <kgftr|konobi> oh... there is.... hhhmmm...

[12:57] <kgftr|konobi> ah... server needs to tell IE what filetype the document is

[12:58] <xinming> M$ sucks. :-P

[13:01] <cm> there should be a doctype as well

[13:19] <rafl> gaal: Great.

[13:44] <xerox> Right! Thanks.

[13:45] <autrijus> :)

[14:48] <stevan_> our pasting service (http://sial.org/pbot/perl6) is gone

[14:49] <stevan_> I think we should switch to a LISP based one (http://paste.lisp.org/) :)

[14:49] <xerox> Lisppaste il great.

[14:50] <xerox> If people agree I could try getting it.

[14:50] <tehmaze> http://perl6.pastebin.com/

[14:50] <tehmaze> ;)

[14:51] <stevan_> *cough* PHP *cough*

[14:51] <xerox> Vote?

[14:51] <stevan_> (+ 1 (+ 1 LISP))

[14:52] <stevan_> The lisp paste allows you to annotate too, which is very nice

[14:52] *** stevan_ is now known as stevan

[14:52] <xerox> ...or, given the anarchistic plan, it's ok to get it now :-)

[14:52] <stevan> xerox: our old one doesnt work,.. so lets get it

[14:52] <xerox> The administrator is currently away, I'll leave him a message.

[14:52] <stevan> besides,.. we have invaded the haskell community,.. Lisp was bound to be next :)

[14:52] <stevan> xerox++

[14:53] <Khisanth> pastebin.com is quite possibly the the crappiest paste site around >_>

[14:55] <stevan> xerox: if the Lispaste admin adds us, just change the channel topic to reflect please 

[14:55] <Juerd> tehmaze: How dare you.

[14:55] <Juerd> xerox: Just get pastebot.

[14:55] <Juerd> xerox: pastebot.sf.net

[14:56] <Juerd> You can run it on feather if you like.

[14:56] <tehmaze> Juerd: it works

[14:56] <Juerd> tehmaze: It's PHP.

[14:56] <tehmaze> so what

[14:56] <xerox> stevan: will do.

[14:56] <Khisanth> it's not even the PHP that makes it crappy :)

[14:56] <Juerd> tehmaze: And in that case, whether it works is highly irrelevant.

[14:56] <stevan> tehmaze: if we cared about something "just working" we wouldn't be here would be ?

[14:57] <tehmaze> Juerd: so you won't buy anything of off an auction site too, if it's in php?

[14:57] <Juerd> tehmaze: That's another thing. This is a Perl 6 channel.

[14:57] <stevan> xerox: excellent, thanks 

[14:57] <tehmaze> ok, what *ever* ;)

[14:57] <Juerd> tehmaze: Things we use must be written in Perl 6 or equally ranked language.

[14:57] <tehmaze> Juerd: lots of my collegues will be attending amsterdam.pm btw

[14:57] <Juerd> tehmaze: Who will?

[14:57] <tehmaze> Juerd: Liz, Jouke, John, Bert

[14:58] <Juerd> You work for Bookings?

[14:58] <tehmaze> right

[14:58] <Juerd> Ah, hm

[14:58] <Juerd> Which John is this?

[14:58] <Juerd> I don't think I know a Bert

[14:58] <tehmaze> Loembang

[14:58] <Juerd> I don't think I know him

[14:58] <gaal> Um, new sigil!

[14:58] <tehmaze> ok

[14:58] <Juerd> gaal: Wha?

[14:58] <tehmaze> Juerd: oh and Giel probably too

[14:58] <Juerd> gaal: We have glyphs left?

[14:59] <tehmaze> Juerd: Bert is my sysadmin-collegue

[14:59] <gaal> Sounds like April Fools, right? How do you type the cent sign?

[14:59] <cm> ¢T xD

[14:59] <Khisanth> gaal: there are still symbols left on the keyboard?

[14:59] <Juerd> gaal: wtf?

[15:00] <cm> http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/23630

[15:01] <tehmaze> it's not the 1st of april yet, Larry 

[15:01] <stevan> eak! 

[15:02] <gaal> hey! what happened to sial.org!?

[15:02] <stevan> gaal: it's nothingmuch's fault I think

[15:02] <xerox> The lispb0rgs are assimilating them.

[15:02] <gaal> stevan: you like to blame him for everything huh!

[15:03] <stevan> gaal: sure, why not :)

[15:03] <Khisanth> gaal: ctrl+shift+a2 if you are using a gtk app :)

[15:03] <gaal> Khisanth: thanks :)

[15:04] <gaal> (but i'm not :)

[15:04] <Juerd> replied with a few questions

[15:04] <gaal> what other pastebots are there around?

[15:04] <Juerd> Why are dollars instances of cents? :)

[15:04] <Juerd> gaal: pastebot.org

[15:04] <Juerd> gaal: Eh, pastebot.sf.net

[15:04] <stevan> gaal: alt-4 on OS X 

[15:05] <Juerd> gaal: You may run it on feather if you wish. It's a Perl thing.

[15:05] <Khisanth> anyone know why the cent sign is not on a qwerty keyword?

[15:06] <Juerd> Khisanth: Which QWERTY is that? There are several dozen.

[15:06] <Juerd> US QWERTY? Because this keyboard has only ASCII characters.

[15:07] <Juerd> Many other QWERTYs => because the keyboard's country doesn't use cent signs

[15:07] <Juerd> Yet others => because in practice, 'c' works equally well

[15:07] <Khisanth> ok I guess the better question would be why ascii doesn't include the cent sign :)

[15:08] <kgftr|konobi> autrijus: do you still have your webl10n presentation anywhere available?

[15:08] <Khisanth> never noticed that

[15:08] <gaal> Juerd: http://pastebot.sourceforge.net/ is a rather uninteresting page with a link to the parent directory. :/

[15:08] <Juerd> Khisanth: It's not an official symbol, iirc

[15:08] <Juerd> http://sourceforge.net/projects/pastebot then

[15:08] <Juerd> And blame dngor for the stupid page on pastebot.sf.net

[15:09] <gaal> Can I blame nothingmuch instead? Lower overhead for me.

[15:10] <Juerd> Heh

[15:10] <Juerd> Hmmm

[15:10] <Juerd> I wonder if I can have a t-shirt made before tonight with a cent symbol and a big red cross

[15:10] <Juerd> Oh, it's past 17:00

[15:10] <Juerd> Then probably not

[15:10] <Juerd> Damn :)

[15:11] <tehmaze> Juerd: make it a `50 c' with a cross then :p

[15:11] <Juerd> I suggest 1c as the ascii equivalent :)

[15:11] <tehmaze> oh, there is a printshop still open on the Vijzelstraat

[15:12] <Juerd> I'm in Dordrecht.

[15:12] <tehmaze> ah, too bad

[15:15] <Juerd> tehmaze: We could get annoying and demand that the euro sign be used

[15:15] <Juerd> tehmaze: It also has a C in its glyph

[15:15] <Juerd> tehmaze: There's now a very americanized imbalance with both $ and (cent thingy) 

[15:15] <tehmaze> no, I agree that ^ is the next logical sigil to use :)

[15:15] <Khisanth> hmm the sideways Quake symbol

[15:18] <Juerd> tehmaze: Only if we call # the comment *sigil*

[15:18] <tehmaze> and ! the not *sigil* ? :)

[15:18] <Juerd> After all, #foo and #foo are practically the same sigil.

[15:18] <Juerd> tehmaze: No, that's an operator.

[15:18] <tehmaze> yes, ! is not a sigil, so that will fit 

[15:19] <Juerd> Hehe

[15:19] <tehmaze> easy to remember too

[15:19] <Juerd> not a sigil, not the not sigil.

[15:19] <Juerd> right.

[15:20] <tehmaze> or 􏿽xAC

[15:20] <gaal> Juerd: pastebot wants some modules from cpan (eg. POE). ok to install directly or do you want me to shoot for debs?

[15:21] <Khisanth> that would make ??!! unpleasant to look at .. $foo ?? ... !! !!!bar;

[15:21] <tehmaze> (shift-` on a UK QWERTY keyboard ;)

[15:21] <Juerd> gaal: Install directly only if it's not installed already.

[15:21] <Juerd> gaal: All available debian perl module packages ARE installed.

[15:23] <gaal> OK. Some things have newer versions on CPAN but hopefully this'll still work.

[15:24] <Juerd> It will

[15:24] <Juerd> If not, please try to use "dh-make-perl --build --install --cpan Module::Name" before installing without debian packages

[15:24] <Juerd> And when you do need to not-use a debian package, remove the installed one first

[15:24] <Juerd> I want to keep the machine upgradable :)

[15:24] <gaal> wtf are Server::Web and Client::IRC that it wants?

[15:26] <Juerd> gaal: Those are its own modules.

[15:26] <gaal> ah, those are parts of pastebot itself. urrr, it's not runnable from the local dir?

[15:26] <Juerd> gaal: pwd?

[15:26] <gaal> (want to test this before make installing)

[15:26] <Juerd> Skip the test. Be a man! :)

[15:26] <gaal> ~gaal/src/pastebot-20040908

[15:27] <gaal> if you say so :)

[15:27] <Juerd> It can *find* the modules

[15:27] <Juerd> But they don't compile

[15:27] <Juerd> Because of runtime errors

[15:27] <Juerd> (Yay for mixed compile and run times)

[15:28] <gaal> yay for silent evals :(

[15:28] <Juerd> Silent?

[15:28] <Juerd> It's an mkdir error

[15:28] <Juerd> pastebot.perl Error while loading Server::Web: mkdir pastestore failed No such file or directory at Util/Data.pm line 268.

[15:29] <Juerd> Compilation failed in require at Server/Web.pm line 20.

[15:29] <gaal> s/silent eval/blind users/

[15:29] <gaal> :(

[15:29] <Juerd> :P

[15:29] <gaal> they probably wanted mkpath instead of mkdir

[15:29] <gaal> fixing

[15:30] <Juerd> Is that an assumption?

[15:31] <gaal> a conjecture.

[15:31] <Juerd> That's the same as an "educated guess" :)

[15:32] <gaal> no, a conjecture doesn't have to be educated. :)

[15:36] <hareldvd__> Any idea which channel for perl-Tk issues?

[15:36] <Juerd> #perl

[15:36] <gaal> weird! the cwd is the current one (added a debug print), so it isn't a mkpath error, but strace doesn't show a mkdir call at all.

[15:37] <Juerd> gaal: See Ulit/Data.pm line 268 then

[15:37] <Juerd> Util even

[15:37] <gaal> that's where i'm looking.

[15:38] <Juerd> Print the argument to mkdir|mkpath. Is it what you want it to be?

[15:38] <gaal> oh, it's just a perl bug:

[15:39] <gaal> mkpath($dir) unless -d $dir  or die "mkdir $dir failed $!";

[15:39] <Juerd> Right

[15:39] <Juerd> No need for do, though

[15:39] <gaal> s/path/dir, but mkpath is better anyway.

[15:40] <Juerd> It's a rather silly bug.

[15:41] <gaal> hello featherpaste.

[15:41] <Juerd> pastebot!

[15:41] <Juerd> :)

[15:41] <Juerd> Oh, this one doesn't respond

[15:42] <autrijus> rehi \camels

[15:42] <Juerd> Hi autrijus 

[15:42] <Juerd> autrijus: Had you seen http://juerd.nl/takahashi/icons.html?

[15:42] <featherpaste> "gaal" at 192.115.25.249 pasted "pbuilder error" (20 lines) at http://feather.perl6.nl:8888/1

[15:42] <gaal> rafl: any ideas?

[15:42] *** Juerd changes topic to: 6.2.10 released! http://xrl.us/hxnb | geoffb's column (/. ed): http://xrl.us/hxhk | pugscode.org | pugs.kwiki.org | paste: http://feather.perl6.nl:8888/ | www.geeksunite.net

[15:43] <gaal> Juerd: the README explains how to set up apache to forward requests to the pastebot (that's its own server), so that people behind firewalls can still access it.

[15:44] <autrijus> Juerd: no, checking

[15:44] <gaal> Juerd: anymoose, now that it's tested to work *g*, i'll make install.

[15:45] <autrijus> Juerd: what is that?

[15:46] <xerox> http://www.sooff.com/database/perform_image/0000/2005070714500022.wmv

[15:47] <Juerd> gaal: http://feather.perl6.nl/paste/

[15:47] <Juerd> autrijus: See http://juerd.nl/, most recent item

[15:48] <gaal> Juerd: k, made install. Now to figure out how to have it start automatically.

[15:48] <autrijus> Juerd: you coming to the 8pm meeting?

[15:48] <Juerd> autrijus: Yep

[15:48] <Juerd> autrijus: Have to find a way to park my car, but will be there.

[15:48] <Juerd> gaal: crontab -e

[15:49] <gaal> I heard parking is terrible in Amsterdam

[15:49] <Juerd> gaal: @reboot /full/path/to/whatever/starts/the/daemon

[15:49] <autrijus> Juerd: cool! the icons looks crazy enough

[15:49] <Juerd> autrijus: This won't be an actual talk, by the way

[15:49] <Juerd> gaal: It is.

[15:50] <Juerd> gaal: Especially in the city centre, where this is.

[15:51] <gaal> Juerd: Tel-Aviv is terrible that way too. Especially in the city centre, where I live!

[15:51] <Juerd> gaal: I've never been there, or even near there :)

[15:51] <Juerd> wb featherpaste 

[15:52] <gaal> one more quit

[15:52] <wolverian> Juerd, wow, SVG icons would work a bit better, methinks :)

[15:53] <Juerd> wolverian: I can't find them :)

[15:54] <Juerd> wolverian: This icon theme is called krystalsvg, even!

[15:54] <Juerd> Doesn't matter for the main idea, though

[15:54] <autrijus> kgftr|konobi: try... web.archive.org

[15:54] <autrijus> I've put what I have at http://autrijus.org/webl10n/

[16:01] <Juerd> in fretta e meglio => ?

[16:01] <xerox> faster and better

[16:02] <xerox> (autrijus, I meant to say that 'si' shouldn't be there)

[16:02] <autrijus> ok :)

[16:03] <autrijus> bbiab, dinner...

[16:03] <gaal> Juerd: *wanna* be there for YAPC on Feb? :)

[16:03] <Juerd> gaal: Yeah, but by then I won't have enough cash yet.

[16:03] <wolverian> oh, haha. larry is on a rampage

[16:05] <Juerd> afk  # ..amsterdam!

[16:06] <gaal> heh, best away message ever :)

[16:07] <gaal> Juerd: re: comment spam. If you don't mind coding some Javascript, you could have the posting form mint a hashcash stamp on every comment. That is quite effective.

[16:19] <theorbtwo> I'm not sure I understand why this needs a new sigil -- what was wrong with ::, or with making it $type does Class?

[18:43] <geoffb> Khisanth, two things: 1) Thanks for the info about ctrl-shift-<hex> in GTK apps.  That makes my life MUCH easier.  2) You wondered why ASCII didn't include the cent sign.  Oddly enough I came across an old document that indicated you probably shouldn't use '$' because it was the only printable character in the ASCII range that was not standard on all systems of the time . . . .

[18:44] <geoffb> Anyone happen to know what the emacs equivalent for the GTK ctrl-shift-<hex> trick for inputting arbitrary Unicode characters would be?

[18:54] <jp-autark> geoffb: M-x insert-ucs-character

[18:54] <geoffb> jp-autark, does that have a default binding?

[18:55] <jp-autark> don't know.

[18:55] <geoffb> (Just curious if I'll have to add a binding everywhere)

[18:55] <geoffb> OK, thanks.

[18:55] <ingy> seen whiteg

[18:55] <jabbot> ingy: whiteg was seen 1 days 1 hours 35 minutes 28 seconds ago

[18:55] <geoffb> Well that's interesting.  My emacs has no insert-ucs-character.

[18:56] <geoffb> jp-autark, which emacs are you using?

[18:56] <jp-autark> geoffb: 21.4.1

[18:56] <geoffb> Ditto, from Debian testing.

[18:56] <geoffb> OK, that's just odd.

[18:57] <geoffb> Add-on emacs package, perhaps?

[18:57] <jp-autark> maybe

[18:57] <geoffb> apt-cache search emacs |wc

[18:57] <geoffb>     332    2762   18095

[18:57] <geoffb> ouch

[18:58] <jp-autark> geoffb: maybe you need the mule-ucs package?

[19:00] <geoffb> Giving it a try

[19:00] <jp-autark> geoffb: there also seems to be a ucs-insert function. Dunno if that's part of mule-ucs as well though.

[19:02] <geoffb> With mule-ucs I now have insert-ucs-character

[19:03] <jp-autark> where you able to do utf stuff with emacs without it?

[19:03] <geoffb> Interesting, it seems to expect decimal codepoints

[19:03] <jp-autark> geoffb: #xHEX

[19:03] <geoffb> jp-autark, I use(d) emacs purely as an ASCII editor

[19:03] <geoffb> I don't think I've ever loaded any file into emacs that wasn't 7-bit clean, AAMOF

[19:04] <jp-autark> or #oOCT, #bBIN. But maybe ucs-insert is easier to use?

[19:04] <geoffb> ah, yes, does direct hex

[19:05] <Khisanth> ucs-insert seems to default to hex here

[19:05] <geoffb> Nope, no *ucs* in the default keybindings

[19:05] <geoffb> Khisanth, yeah, that's what I just found.

[19:06] <geoffb> Now I just have to memorize some codepoints, and I'm good to go

[19:06] <jp-autark> though insert-ucs-character may be useful if you only can remember the binary code for say 0x30a2 ;)

[19:07] <geoffb> Ah, and ucs-insert is unique in the first two characters.  Makes M-x uc<tab> work

[19:07] <geoffb> or rather,

[19:07] <geoffb> M-x uc<enter>

[19:08] <geoffb> Thanks much, jp-autark 

[19:08] <jp-autark> np, good luck remembering

[19:10] <geoffb> Actually, I'm choosing to just learn codepoint insertion and a list of codepoints, because that makes using unicode an N + M problem, rather than an N * M using magic combinations in each app.

[19:11] <jp-autark> hopefully your list isn't too long :)

[19:11] <geoffb> And frankly, GTK and Emacs cover most of the places I need unicode.

[19:11] <geoffb> jp-autark, almost entirely limited to those to be used by Perl 6, actually.  :-)

[19:12] * jp-autark grins

[19:12] <Khisanth> AB and BB are useful :)

[19:12] <geoffb> Now if we could just convince irclogger to set the charset for #perl6 to UTF-8

[19:12] <geoffb> Khisanth, nod.  Now remembered.

[19:12] <Khisanth> irclogger?

[19:13] * geoffb goes to look up yen

[19:13] <geoffb> http://colabti.de/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2005-10-20,Thu

[19:13] <Khisanth> hrm yen is a5

[19:13] <Khisanth> just a few spots from ¢ :)

[19:14] <theorbtwo> OS-level compose combinations are happy things.

[19:14] <Khisanth> $¢£€¥foo :D

[19:15] <geoffb> Khisanth, heh

[19:15] <theorbtwo> compose,c,/ ... yey, got it on the first guess.

[19:15] <Khisanth> oh forgot %

[19:15] <theorbtwo> ¢

[19:15] <theorbtwo> «»¢¥... what am I forgetting?

[19:15] <geoffb> theorbtwo, OS?

[19:16] <theorbtwo> xorg/linux

[19:17] <geoffb> theorbtwo, what is the compose key sequence there?

[19:20] <theorbtwo> Not sure I understand the question.

[19:20] <theorbtwo> << = «, >> = », c/ = ¢, y- = ¥

[19:22] <imperator_> is perl6 doing selector namespaces? and if so, does one of the apocalypse/exegesis cover it? I just want to check out the proposed syntax

[19:22] <theorbtwo> Selector namespaces?

[19:22] <imperator_> (no luck with google)

[19:23] <imperator_> theorbtwo, encapsulation within scope

[19:23] <geoffb> theorbtwo, I meant, what key(s) do you use to begin a composition

[19:23] <geoffb> ?

[19:28] <jp-autark> geoffb: pugs/docs/quickref/unicode seems to be highly relevant.

[19:28] <stevan> imperator_: do you mean private packages/classes?

[19:28] <stevan> imperator_: package Foo { my package Bar {}}

[19:29] <stevan> imperator_: Foo would be accessible from the outside, but Foo::Bar would not (IIRC)

[19:30] <geoffb> jp-autark, thanks again

[19:31] <theorbtwo> geoffb, you can set it to what you want; on most keymaps there isn't one by default.

[19:31] <theorbtwo> xmodmap -e 'keycode 94 = Multi_key'

[19:32] <imperator_> stevan, that sounds like it :)

[19:32] <geoffb> theorbtwo, ah, thanks

[19:32] <geoffb> Hmmm, more is preserving unicode prettiness, but less is mangling.

[19:33] <theorbtwo> Hold on a sec, that probably won't be useful for you.

[19:33] <theorbtwo> 94 is the key to the right of left shift on a 102 key keyboard.

[19:34] <theorbtwo> I'm using a German keyboard with an American keymap, making that key extra.  Most people either need it or don't have it.

[19:35] <theorbtwo> To find the number for an arbitrary key, use xev, put your cursor in, hit the key, and look for a line stating "keycode NN".

[19:35] <geoffb> Yeah, saw that at the bottom of the doc jp-autark pointed out

[19:35] <geoffb> And FWIW, 'less -r' seems to be needed to see the unicode

[19:35] <geoffb> (as other than hex crappage)

[19:36] <theorbtwo> Oooh.

[19:39] <wolverian> Juerd, would it be possible to get irssi 0.8.10rc5 or some other, newer than 2003, svn version on feather?

[19:40] <wolverian> Juerd, ubuntu packages rc5, at least. let me check debian. (it's for the /recode support)

[19:40] <theorbtwo> I suppose it's a bit early to add ¢ to the list at the top of pugs/docs/quickref/unicode, esp since the ascii fallback hasn't been defined yet.

[19:41] <wolverian> Juerd, ah, no, feather's apt-cache doesn't see a newer irssi. :/

[19:43] <ErRandir> can anyone tell me what to put in the -time parameter in Tk's eventGenerate() ?

[19:44] <geoffb> ErRandir, I'm assuming you want #perl

[19:44] <geoffb> And BTW, why doesn't #perl appear to so many people?

[19:44] <Limbic_Region> define doesn't appear

[19:45] <geoffb> Limbic_Region, many people come to #perl6 when they want #perl, saying that #perl didn't appear in their channel list, but #perl6 does.

[19:45] <Limbic_Region> ErRandir - this channel is primarily for the discussion of the development of perl6 - not to discuss issues with per5

[19:45] <Limbic_Region> geoffb correctly indicated you should probably be in #perl

[19:45] <ErRandir> sorry. thx

[19:45] <Limbic_Region> geoffb - oh, not knowing what a channel list is I hadn't ever seen that

[19:46] <geoffb> Limbic_Region, ah

[19:46] <Limbic_Region> my client allows me to type in the channel I want to join

[19:46] <integral> #perl is +s.  someone should fix that *hint*

[19:46] * Limbic_Region doesn't have ops in #perl 

[19:48] <geoffb> integral, what does +s mean?  Invisible?

[19:48] <wolverian> secret

[19:49] <integral> "let's hide from all the spambots!"

[19:52] <kolibrie> hmm, why does my terminal allow the Ctrl-Shift-<hex> normally, but in irssi I get weird symbols?

[19:53] <Khisanth> irssi is probably intercepting those

[19:53] <kolibrie> for shame!

[19:54] <kolibrie> workaround?

[19:58] <Limbic_Region> don't use irssi

[19:59] <Limbic_Region> ;-)

[19:59] <kolibrie> :(

[20:00] <Limbic_Region> kolibrie - I use CGI:IRC from work because I can't IRC directly - it does silly things like intercepts plus symbols (+) and doesn't display them

[20:01] <Limbic_Region> Juerd was kind enough to hack in a fix for that specific problem - but that's clients

[20:01] <Limbic_Region> err - that's the nature of clients

[20:01] <theorbtwo> I could have sworn that there was a way to set the charset of a chan, but I may be thinking of gaim.

[20:03] <kolibrie> I'm sure autrijus types unicode into his irssi

[20:04] <theorbtwo> Oh, you should start your irssi with a unicode locale set, possibly?

[20:04] <theorbtwo> Er, utf8, not just unicode.

[20:05] <Khisanth> doesn't irssi have a /recode thing?

[20:05] <Khisanth> I don't use it but I have seen that mentioned quite a few times :)

[20:05] <theorbtwo> "No help for recode."

[20:05] * kolibrie has never heard of recode

[20:07] <kolibrie> theorbtwo: LANG=en_US.UTF-8 ?

[20:08] <theorbtwo> Looks OK to me.

[20:08] <theorbtwo> I have LANG=en_US.utf-8.

[20:09] <theorbtwo> http://jerakeen.org/blog/2005/06/23/screen-irssi-utf8

[20:10] <Juerd> wolverian: .deb does not automatically mean it's compatible. In fact, it's likely to not be.

[20:10] <Juerd> Hi from the amsterdam.pm post-oscon meeting!

[20:11] <Juerd> wolverian: If you can get a feather-compatible .deb for irssi, go ahead. If you want to build your own irssi in your homedir, of cuorse, you're also free to do so.

[20:11] <kolibrie> theorbtwo: sounds complicated

[20:11] <theorbtwo> Most of that is the extra screen step.

[20:13] <kolibrie> it worked!!

[20:14] <theorbtwo> Cool.

[20:14] <xinming> hmm, I saw the oscon05-autrijus.mp4 But I don't understand some idea on pugs. :-S

[20:14] <kolibrie> actually, it looks like I only needed the irssi set command, everything else was already set that way

[20:15] <xinming> hmm, Will pugs be the tool to bootstrap perl 6? hmm, If true. Then, after perl 6 is written, What will pugs be?

[20:16] <xinming> I mean where should pugs project go. :-S

[20:17] <wolverian> Juerd, right. thanks :)

[20:19] <PerlJam> xinming: pugs doesn't have to go anywhere

[20:19] <theorbtwo> The Road goes ever on and on,

[20:19] <theorbtwo> Down from the door where it began.

[20:19] <theorbtwo> Now far ahead the road has gone,

[20:19] <theorbtwo> And I must follow, if I can,

[20:19] <theorbtwo> Pursuing it with eager feet,

[20:19] <theorbtwo> Until it joins some larger way

[20:19] <theorbtwo> Where many paths and errands meet.

[20:20] <theorbtwo> And wither then? I cannot say.

[20:20] <theorbtwo> We'll worry about that when we get there.

[20:20] <theorbtwo> Anything else would be premature pessimization.

[20:20] <Limbic_Region> well, unless someone gets the bright idea of parrot targeting haskell ....

[20:21] <xerox> \o/

[20:21] <theorbtwo> You mean haskell targeting parrot, Limbic.

[20:21] <Limbic_Region> no, but that too

[20:21] <Limbic_Region> ;-)

[20:22] <Limbic_Region> I was just saying that pugs has multiple backends currently that work the opposite way parrot is designed

[20:22] <Limbic_Region> we turn p6 code into other languages

[20:24] <xinming> a bit confused by the relation for pugs and perl 6 now. :-S

[20:25] <theorbtwo> pugs is an implementation of perl 6.

[20:25] <theorbtwo> It's up in the air as to if it will become /the/ implementation of perl 6.  Sources point to no.

[20:26] <theorbtwo> However, it will almost certianly be a very useful thing in writing the perl 6, if for no other reason that people have played with it some and figured out what works, what doesn't, what is underspecified...

[20:27] <Khisanth> hrm pasteling is back :)

[20:28] <xinming> hmm, what does the backends do then? :-S

[20:28] <PerlJam> theorbtwo: it *is* a very useful thing.

[20:28] <xinming> there are many backends. :-S

[20:28] <xinming> GHC, JS, JSON, PIL, PIR, Parrot, Perl5, Pugs

[20:28] <Limbic_Region> xinming - forget pugs for a second

[20:29] <Limbic_Region> p6 is intended to run on Parrot

[20:29] <Limbic_Region> so p6 parses p6 and compiles to parrot asm

[20:29] <Limbic_Region> introduce pugs

[20:29] <Limbic_Region> haskell parses p6 and compiles to haskell

[20:29] <xinming> Limbic_Region: yes, I know that, p6 bootstrap...

[20:29] <Limbic_Region> haskell parses p6 and compiles to p5

[20:29] <Limbic_Region> haskell parses p6 and compiles to JavaScript

[20:29] <xinming> ....

[20:30] <Limbic_Region> haskell parses p6 and compiles to etc

[20:30] <xinming> ...

[20:30] <Limbic_Region> xinming - I didn't say anything about bootstrapping

[20:30] <xinming> amazing...

[20:30] <Limbic_Region> that is a bi-product of parsing/compiling p6 code

[20:30] <xinming> Limbic_Region: hm, I know, I mean p6 is parses p6 circle...

[20:30] <Limbic_Region> or rather - that is a bi-product ability of

[20:31] <Limbic_Region> so what I was saying is even if Pugs is used as the means for bootstrapping p6

[20:31] <Limbic_Region> it still does things p6/parrot weren't intended to do

[20:31] <Limbic_Region> or even ponie

[20:31] <svnbot6> r7693 | kolibrie++ | added some missing twigils

[20:31] <Limbic_Region> it takes the p6 code and targets a completely different backend instead of making those languages target parrot

[20:32] <xinming> Limbic_Region: hmm, So, what does these do in real life? Or It's just for fun? :-S

[20:33] <PerlJam> xinming: for one, pugs allows us to hammer out design issues without having "the" perl6 compiler around.

[20:33] <xinming> If so, the efficiency is too "low" IMHO...

[20:33] <integral> -Ofun!

[20:34] <Limbic_Region> pugs is optimized for fun

[20:34] <Limbic_Region> err integral beat me to the punch

[20:34] <theorbtwo> xinming: Fun is the point; being useful is just something that happens by accident sometimes.

[20:34] <Limbic_Region> PerlJam - right, but that's not xinming's question

[20:34] <Limbic_Region> the question was regarding post p6 1.0

[20:35] <theorbtwo> The more interesting question is "how are we going to get to perl 6 1.0".

[20:35] <theorbtwo> Sadly, I have no idea.

[20:35] <PerlJam> Post p6, pugs can still fulfill that role.

[20:36] <xinming> If So, we can compile the perl 6 code into haskell or perl 5 or other $language... and using the compiler which compiles other $language to get perl 6 done. right?

[20:37] <PerlJam> pos p6, pugs will still have abilities that p6,ponie,parrot, etc. don't have.  Having features in pugs might also encourage those features to be added to the "real" p6 compiler (or ponie or p5 or parrot or whatever)

[20:37] <PerlJam> s/^pos/post/

[20:38] <theorbtwo> I think the most reasonable way to get to a self-bootstrapping perl6 is to make something that compiles haskell to perl6.

[20:38] <theorbtwo> ...then run it on pugs.

[20:39] <xinming> hmm, If what I said is true. then, which will be chosen to compile the official perl 6? :-P

[20:39] <PerlJam> theorbtwo: I don't know about that.  It depends how quickly we can get a PGE-like thingy in haskell I think.

[20:43] <xinming> Oh, lost again... :-S

[20:44] <ingy> seen autrijus 

[20:44] <jabbot> ingy: autrijus was seen 4 hours 41 minutes 40 seconds ago

[20:54] <Juerd> ingy: autrijus was seen less than an hour ago IRL

[20:54] <Juerd> ingy: He left the meeting, probably to sleep

[20:54] <ingy> Juerd: thanks...

[20:55] <ingy> maybe you can give me an opinion on a Perl module UI issue

[20:55] <ingy> I'm reworking YAML.pm so that it can support multiple backend parser/formatters

[20:56] <ingy> including YAML::Loader::Syck (which wraps libsyck)

[20:56] <ingy> so do I expose these choices to the user as:

[20:56] <ingy> use YAML -syck;

[20:56] <geoffb> ingy++ on that

[20:56] <ingy> or

[20:56] <ingy> use YAML::Syck;

[20:57] <ingy> I started on the former but am now leaning towards the latter

[20:57] <geoffb> I would agree with that, ingy (using the latter form)

[20:58] <ingy> the idea is that YAML::Syck would subclass YAML

[20:58] <theorbtwo> I'd use the latter.

[20:58] <ingy> and get all the basic UIness for free

[20:58] <ingy> ok thanks

[20:59] <theorbtwo> If you make them different modules, it makes it easier to have them be different os-level packages.

[21:00] <ingy> in either case they would be separate modules / distributions

[21:00] <theorbtwo> libyaml-perl has no interesting dependencies, libyaml-syck-perl depends on libsyck and libyaml-perl.

[21:01] <theorbtwo> If they'd be sepperate modules/distributions, you'd need extra code in the superclass to support the subclass being able to have -syck support in the import.

[21:01] <ingy> theorbtwo: right, I already wrote that and it is ugly

[21:36] <fmadero> is there a command one could use to list all perl modules 

[21:42] * nothingmuch gladly announces that he managed to gently bend the enclosure of his laptop out

[21:42] <nothingmuch> so that it's no longer scraping the hinges when the screen is opened

[21:57] <rafl> gaal: Maybe try to use a version of sid that's not that recent. snapshot.debian.net - 5-days-ago or something like that.

[21:59] <ingy> nothingmuch: you are always breaking things ;)

[22:00] <rafl> gaal: Also do you have cdeboostrap installed?

[22:16] <mugwump> stevan: I like your graphviz charts

[23:52] <gaal> rafl: hmm, really i just need a ghc from cvs on linux. can't that bug in the binary version simply be fixed? it's "just" a wrong dependency in the package metadata apparently. #319812
