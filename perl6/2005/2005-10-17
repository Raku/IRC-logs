[00:00] <geoffb> good!

[00:00] <geoffb> It's about time.

[00:01] <rafl> Well, good for those people using the major archs.

[00:01] <rafl> And not too bad for the other guys, after all.

[00:02] <geoffb> Yeah.

[00:03] <geoffb> The four arches you mentioned have enough differences that portability should still be a strong push.

[00:03] <rafl> Yes. It's also not said that Debian won't run on the other archs anymore.

[00:04] <geoffb> right -- and that's all part of why I was happy to see the staggered release idea proposed, and discussion looking positive

[00:05] <rafl> ACK.

[02:29] <autrijus> it's in Pugs.Prim's op1 "hex"

[02:29] <autrijus> the "read" there needs to be guarded with a try

[02:34] <coral> ah, cool

[02:34] <autrijus> I wonder if it should throw an exception.

[02:35] <autrijus> I'll leave it as undef for now

[02:35] <coral> hex of 'h' is illegal but hex of anything negative is ???

[02:35] <coral> dunno

[05:53] <spinclad> rafl: installation report.  Tried Installing the four pugs packages from debian sid (hurrah! rafl++!).

[05:53] <spinclad> Three went in w/ no problems: pugs, pugs-modules, pugs-doc.

[05:54] <spinclad> Installing libghc6-pugs-dev failed at first as I didn't have a /usr/local/include.

[05:55] <spinclad> After mkdir /usr/local/include, it also installed.

[05:57] <spinclad> Problem: /usr/lib/haskell-packages/ghc6/lib/Pugs-6.2.10/installed-pkg-config has the line:

[05:57] <spinclad> include-dirs: /usr/local/include /usr/lib/perl/5.8/CORE

[05:58] <spinclad> which doesn't seem right to me.

[06:00] <spinclad> I believe I ought to have the directory but the package should not refer to it.

[06:02] <spinclad> Very happy to see 6.2.10 in Debian!  rafl++

[06:03] <coral> in ubuntu with all package sources enabled for hoary and breezy:

[06:03] <coral> Package pugs is not available, but is referred to by another package.

[06:03] <coral> $ apt-cache search pugs

[06:03] <coral> pugs-doc - Documentation for pugs

[06:03] <coral> maybe i'm missing a package list.

[06:04] <spinclad> what other package?

[06:04] <spinclad> in debian sid at the moment only pugs-modules depends on pugs

[06:06] <spinclad> (mutually, as it happens)

[06:13] <autrijus> greetings from euro oscon

[06:13] <coral> hello autrijus

[06:13] <autrijus> first tutorial of the day: Ruby on Rails - Enjoying the ride of programming!

[06:14] <coral> re-fetched my ubuntu package lists, no errors this time

[06:14] <coral> no pugs either, only pugs-doc

[06:14] <obra> morning autrijus

[06:14] * autrijus prepares for the assault of eigenclasses

[06:14] * coral files a bug

[06:14] <coral> wait, maybe it's unstable. i bet that's it. or something.

[06:16] <geoffb> Greetings, autrijus

[06:18] <autrijus> yo geoffb 

[06:19] <geoffb> Did you already do your lightning talks?

[06:21] <luqui> cool, OpenGL works in haskell.  I might have to port Glop to haskell.

[06:21] <luqui> or better yet, add OpenGL bindings to pugs

[06:22] <luqui> and then port glop to perl 6 (and be completely unable to write any games in it because of the speed)

[06:22] <luqui> oh, euro oscon, neat

[06:23] <geoffb> luqui: SDL_perl already works with pugs.

[06:23] <geoffb> In fact, I'm in the middle of talking to chromatic about it elsewhere

[06:24] <luqui> yeah, but SDL_Perl is a pain in the ass to install

[06:24] <autrijus> geoffb: no, lightning talks is tomorrow morning

[06:24] <luqui> anybody who runs pugs has already installed haskell, and therefore already has the bindings

[06:24] <autrijus> geoffb: and apparently I did my slides in the reverse order of presentation

[06:24] <autrijus> fun!

[06:24] <geoffb> autrijus, heh

[06:25] <geoffb> luqui, on what platform?  For Win32 and various *nixen, it's an easy install

[06:25] <luqui> it's not that easy for Win32, because SDL::OpenGL doesn't work, so you have to fall back to OpenGL.pm

[06:25] <luqui> on OS X is just a damn pain

[06:26] <autrijus> ...inflicted acme with T-shirts...

[06:26] <luqui> I could also put it this way:  you can get it to work everywhere, but it works very differently everywhere

[06:26] <geoffb> luqui, you are incorrect about Win32.  SDL::OpenGL works.  Which I know, because I host the PPM repo for it.  :-)

[06:27] <luqui> oh, that's great that it works for you :-)

[06:27] <coral> heh

[06:27] <hoowa_> hi tang did u here

[06:27] <autrijus> hoowa_, chromatic: greetings.

[06:28] <hoowa_> i need u help tang 

[06:28] <geoffb> luqui, um, it should just work.  As in, run PPM, hit the URL in my PPM rep, life is golden.

[06:28] <autrijus> chromatic: are you @ .nl?

[06:28] <chromatic> No, .or.us.

[06:28] <coral> hello portland!

[06:28] <coral> (or nearby)

[06:28] <chromatic> West of PDX, but not Beaverton.

[06:28] <chromatic> Stupid Beaverton.

[06:28] * luqui is pretty sure he got the PPM from you (the only PPM I could find).  There was breakage (SDL::OpenGL exprorted, nay, had no symbols whatsoever)

[06:28] <hoowa_> tang pls help repair my cpan id, i forgot all long time

[06:29] <luqui> anyway, I could email you when I pick the project back up again, if you're interested

[06:29] * luqui read that as "Stupid Beethoven"

[06:29] <autrijus> hoowa_: you need me reset your password?

[06:29] <chromatic> I like Beethoven.

[06:29] * luqui too

[06:29] <luqui> :-)

[06:29] <hoowa_> tang yes

[06:29] <autrijus> hoowa_: ok, doing so

[06:29] * coral prods pause.perl.org forlornly

[06:29] <hoowa_> and

[06:30] <geoffb> luqui, sorry, multitasking.  You probably got the PPM from crazywhathisname or from Tels.  Both had broken OpenGL modules.

[06:30] <luqui> okay, I shall try again at some point

[06:30] <coral> http://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=mailpw will mail forgotten passwords if (1) you know your CPAN id and (2) you have access to the email it was registered with

[06:31] <luqui> Glop is not my current focus though (because I've decided that it needs to be redesigned)

[06:31] <geoffb> The one on broadwell.org should be clean.  And I even went anarchy++ and opened up the repo.  Join #sdlperl and look at the topic.  committer bits for all.

[06:31] <geoffb> luqui, understood

[06:31] <chromatic> Or hook up Parrot to Pugs and then we can use Parrot SDL from Perl 6....

[06:31] <autrijus> ...but wait, it's already hooked (via eval"")...

[06:31] <autrijus> but object-level hooking would be nice.

[06:31] <luqui> the reason I started talking about this is because I just wrote a trivial program with haskell's opengl bindings

[06:32] <luqui> so we could have opengl under parrot and haskell backends

[06:32] <coral> oo

[06:32] <chromatic> I just wrote a trivial program with Perl 5's OpenGL bindings.

[06:32] <coral> if you can find JS-addressable OpenGL plugins for web browsers

[06:32] <luqui> (even though, as geoffb points out, we can already have opengl under haskell using perl5:SDL::OpenGL)

[06:32] <luqui> coral, I wish  (seriously, if they exist, tell me)

[06:33] <luqui> maybe you could set up OpenGL through Java, and then let JS address Java

[06:33] <luqui> the generic "you", of course

[06:33] <geoffb> Yeah, cause definitely not me.

[06:34] <geoffb> :-)

[06:34] <coral> 2005-04-28

[06:34] <coral> I'm currently writing a plugin for Firefox using OpenGL on Win32.

[06:34] <coral> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=292303

[06:34] <coral> also https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=specific&order=relevance+desc&bug_status=__open__&content=opengl

[06:35] <luqui> coral: sweeet

[06:35] <luqui> keep me posted

[06:36] <coral> http://www.synthesisters.com/download/JavascriptInMax.pdf appears to indicate that 'Max' (3dsmax, maybe?) supports javascript that manipulates opengl

[06:36] <coral> er, 'Sketch'?

[06:36] <hoowa_> thank u tang

[06:36] <geoffb> coral, very cool 

[06:36] <coral> XWT has opengl acceleration and javascript parser

[06:36] <coral> nothing appears to quite be covering the specific need except that one win32 bug above

[06:37] <coral> heh, there's "vrcore1, a new portable 3D engine for OpenGL with javascript scripting"

[06:37] <coral> pugs->js->opengl rendering :)

[06:37] <luqui> I'm sure that will be really really fast :-p

[06:38] <coral> hee hee

[06:38] * luqui is under the impression that you can make many great games without speed though

[06:38] <luqui> or even a speedy library

[06:38] <luqui> (marijuana is a necessity though, apparently)

[06:38] * luqui should get to bed

[06:38] <coral> i was addicted to tetris perfectly sober

[14:24] <QtPlatypus> Morning

[15:10] <geoffb> autrijus, how goes the conference?

[15:11] <Limbic_Region> geoffb - IIRC, you were mildly interested in a list of neat/interesting questions/challenges/riddles at the Monastery right?

[15:12] <geoffb> yeah, sure . . . what's new?

[15:13] <Limbic_Region> oh, for a project I am working on I am collecting a list of links

[15:14] <geoffb> ah

[15:14] <Limbic_Region> some are to steal er borrow ideas from and others are to use as is

[15:14] <geoffb> What is the project?

[15:14] <Limbic_Region> uber top secret

[15:14] <eric256> lol

[15:14] <Limbic_Region> but in any acct, when the list is compiled, I would be happy to share them with you

[15:14] <theorbtwo> BUM BUM BUM!

[15:14] * geoffb is cleared "uber top secret", you see

[15:15] <Limbic_Region> let me say this about that

[15:15] <Limbic_Region> there are often times when a self-taught programmer reaches the end of a road

[15:15] <Limbic_Region> they have figured out all they started out to learn and don't know where to go from here

[15:16] <Limbic_Region> they don't know what they don't know so they don't know where to learn what it is they don't know

[15:16] <Limbic_Region> there are lots of diversions that are fun and can spark inspiration

[15:16] <geoffb> nod

[15:16] <Limbic_Region> perl golf, poetry, obfusacation

[15:16] <geoffb> good idea, htat

[15:16] <Limbic_Region> well - my personal favorite is these puzzles/challenges/interesting questions

[15:17] <geoffb> My favorite is hanging out here.  :-)

[15:17] <Limbic_Region> a second personal favorite of mine is letting Necessity be the mother of invention

[15:17] <Limbic_Region> solve an old problem by intentionally limiting what tools you will allow yourself to use

[15:17] <Limbic_Region> you end up either learning about new tools or how to use known tools in new and novel ways

[15:18] <Limbic_Region> I use the Monastery as a means to accomplish 1 and 2

[15:18] <Limbic_Region> anyway - I have monopolized enough of #perl6 on semi-OT stuff

[15:18] <Limbic_Region> when the list is complete I will let you know

[15:19] <Khisanth> <Limbic_Region> they have figured out all they started out to learn and don't know where to go from here < following autrijus wouldn't be a bad idea :D

[15:19] <geoffb> Speaking of which, at one point I started doing a Perl version of busybox, so that I would be forced to learn all the rarely-used params for the old unix favorites

[15:19] <Khisanth> I mean the stuff he mentions in his journal :)

[15:19] <theorbtwo> I'd more call golf, poetry, and obfuscation modifiers on a problem then problems unto themselves.

[15:20] <Limbic_Region> Khisanth - well, chances are if they are giften enough to be able to follow autrijus then they don't need help being inspired

[15:20] <Limbic_Region> theorbtwo - I was just saying that they are ways to find inspiration while having fun

[15:21] * eric256 can't get mysql to start up... this stupid server is going out the window very very soon

[15:21] <theorbtwo> (Problem: print "Hello world" to the screen.  Golf: Print hello world to the screen with a short program... etc.

[15:21] <theorbtwo> Hm, L~R, I'd love to see that list sometimes, as I very much have that problem.

[15:21] <Khisanth> Print hello world without using print! :)

[15:22] <Limbic_Region> exactly Khisanth

[15:22] <Khisanth> emm system calls

[15:22] <Limbic_Region> that really isn't a golf one though - that is a necessity is the mother of invention one

[15:22] * eric256 notices that his servers hard drive is full and apologizes to it. lol

[15:22] <geoffb> eric256, heh

[15:23] <theorbtwo> Allo, stevan.

[15:23] <stevan> hey theorbtwo 

[15:23] <Limbic_Region> theorbtwo - noted

[15:23] <Khisanth> eric256: it didn't give any useful error message?

[15:24] <eric256> crap....relay log file for replication became corrupted because of DF errors.../me thinks someone is plotting against him.

[15:27] <eric256> any one know if is there an irc room for MySQL help somewhere?

[15:29] <Steve_p> eric256, yes, #mysql 

[15:29] <eric256> yea i realized that after asking...can't convince trillian to give me a list of channels so i just gave it a try. ;)

[15:35] * eric256 attempts to twiddle his thumbs whil

[15:35] <eric256> e waiting... stupid enter key is in the wrong spot

[16:00] <eric256> anyone know how to make an op only work for a List/Array in haskell?

[16:09] <wolverian> evening

[16:09] <Khisanth> afternoon :)

[16:09] <eric256> and goodnight ;)

[16:09] <wolverian> :)

[16:10] <wolverian> I'm afraid I'll have to restart this irssi session (locale problems) - see you in a minute

[16:19] <wolverian> ah, here we go.

[17:25] <eric256> odd that sometimes this room is hoping and sometimes it's silent, and always, when i'm ready to do some haskell hacking its silent. lol ;) its like they know and flee before i can ask them annoying questions

[17:26] <Khisanth> ;)

[17:27] <eric256> Khisanth is that a name from a book?  its rining faint bells in my head.

[17:34] <autrijus> eric256: yeah, my HD crashed :/

[17:35] <eric256> ouch. luckily CPAN has some docs on it ;)

[17:35] <autrijus> the 9.3th State of Onion is about to begin.

[17:35] <eric256> is there an easy way to make op1 "shift" not work on lists?

[17:35] <obra> 9.3th...hm

[17:35] <autrijus> eric256: declare it as Array::shift

[17:35] <eric256> 9.3th? lol. way to commit

[17:36] <eric256> ehh i meant not work on strings.. 

[17:36] <autrijus> declare it as List::shift

[17:37] <eric256> thanks...now to figure out what that means. ;)

[17:38] <eric256> thanks autrijus

[17:38] <svnbot6> r7656 | autrijus++ | * All-day pair poetry with Allison -- one stanza and one paragraph left

[17:38] <autrijus> np :)

[17:44] <eric256> okay that was just way easy...is that documented somewhere that i should have found? 

[17:44] <autrijus> no... not really... suggestions welcome

[17:45] <fglock__> is List::Shift overridable (with plain p6)?

[17:45] <autrijus> fglock__: sure!

[17:45] <autrijus> it's just a sym bound in &List::shift

[17:45] <autrijus> so you just rebind it

[17:46] <fglock__> does this mean I could install a Lazy list handler? :)

[17:46] <autrijus> why, yes! :)

[17:46] <eric256> the opcodes can be overridden? /me needs a lesson in Pugs compiler hehe

[17:47] <autrijus> rafl: if you put it in Prelude.pm then it'll even Just Work

[17:49] * eric256 smiles as 45.shift now gives a sort of error ;)

[17:50] <autrijus> <lwall> "Haskell makes hard things really easy, but easy things kinda hard"

[17:51] <Khisanth> that sounds like almost but not quite :)

[17:52] <Limbic_Region> autrijus - has $larry learned Haskell yet or is he still an initiate?

[17:52] <eric256> how would i make that give a real error?  just define op1 "shift' = fail "Can't call shift on a non-List"?

[17:52] <autrijus> Limbic_Region: he just said he was "humbled" as he found learning haskell really challenging

[17:52] <autrijus> eric256: sure

[17:52] <Khisanth> shift now works on Lists?

[17:53] <autrijus> no, it should probably work on arrays (I hope)

[17:53] <eric256> shift worked on everything before.

[17:53] <eric256> should that be Array::shift then instead?

[17:53] <autrijus> yeah, it was *shift

[17:53] <autrijus> I think so yeah

[17:53] <autrijus> (battery about-ish to run out of power)

[17:54] <fglock__> autrijus: in pugs, does 1..Inf create a List or an Array?

[17:54] <autrijus> fglock__: List is value, Array is container, so it's a list

[17:55] <eric256> and shift/pop should only work on Array containers not List values?

[17:55] <autrijus> I think so

[17:55] * eric256 just trying to wrap his head around the verbiage

[17:56] <autrijus> <lwall> "It's more important to design a language to be expert-friendly, than optimizing for least-surprise-ish newbie friendly"

[17:56] <fglock__> in "@a=(0, 1..Inf)", the array object contains 2 things? (that's how it works in pilrun)

[17:56] <Khisanth> oh? when did he say that?

[17:56] <Limbic_Region> you should be able to subscript a list but I personally don't think you should be able to shift/pop/unshift/push a list

[17:56] <Limbic_Region> it feels un-natural

[17:56] <Khisanth> Limbic_Region: AGREED!

[17:56] <autrijus> <lwall> "...otoh we still need to engineer a bit on the newbie friendly bit, or we end up reinventing Haskell"

[17:57] <Limbic_Region> heh

[17:57] <Khisanth> it conjures up visions of people doing silly things like "shift (1..10);"

[17:57] <eric256> umm fail drops clear out of pugs command line?

[17:58] <Limbic_Region> I like having the ability to do $str .= (1..10, 'A'..'F')[ rand 16] for 1 .. 10; but think that's where the line should be drawn

[17:58] <autrijus> eric256: shouldn't do that

[17:58] <Juerd> fglock__: (0,1...) is (0...) with [1] already known, that's all

[17:58] <autrijus> eric256: fail in Eval monad should fail gracefully

[17:58] <Limbic_Region> otherwise lists should just be anonymous arrays

[17:58] <eric256> its definitly kicking me clear out. 

[17:58] <Juerd> Limbic_Region: 1..10, really?

[17:58] <Juerd> 0..9?

[17:58] <autrijus> eric256: weird

[17:59] <autrijus> eric256: fail in IO monad would do that to you

[17:59] <eric256> dunno what that means. ;)

[17:59] <autrijus> eric256: just commit :)

[17:59] <eric256> i removed the errors i added because they weren't working right

[17:59] <eric256> now i'll commit

[17:59] <Limbic_Region> Juerd - the point was on the subscripting not on the accuracy of the range, but thanks ;-)

[17:59] <Juerd> Limbic_Region: $str = concat [0..9,'A'..'F'].pick XX 16;

[17:59] <autrijus> k

[18:00] <Limbic_Region> Lists and Arrays are not the same thing - and shift/pop/unshift/push shouldn't work on lists IMO

[18:00] <autrijus> Limbic_Region: sure

[18:00] <Juerd> They *can't* work on lists

[18:01] <Juerd> list : array :: ro : rw

[18:01] <eric256> commited but its not working. ;)

[19:18] <glasser> like something that would tell me about the standard libs in GHC or whatever

[19:20] <glasser> anyone have a preference between the thompson and the hudak, if i'm going to try to request one at my library?

[19:20] <Khisanth> hmm there IS a page with the stuff in the Haskell prelude

[20:29] <eric256> realy question...is .perl broken...or is it realy seeing it that way?

[20:29] <wolverian> that's how the syntax works

[20:30] <eric256> realy?  ( ) arn't enough to impose a list contruct?

[20:30] <wolverian> they don't do so in perl5; I don't think they do in perl5 either.

[20:30] <wolverian> erm, s:2nd/perl5/perl6/

[20:33] <eric256> hmmm quick test shows you are right..

[20:33] <eric256> okay. just not what i expected ;)

[20:38] <svnbot6> r7663 | iblech++ | * t/var/caller.t: According to S02, only vars declared "is env" should be

[20:38] <svnbot6> r7663 | iblech++ |   accessible via $CALLER::. Fixed the tests accordingly and added some new ones.

[20:38] <svnbot6> r7663 | iblech++ | * PIL2JS: README:

[20:38] <svnbot6> r7663 | iblech++ |   * Minor TODO update.

[20:38] <Juerd> eric256: There should be no list constructor.

[20:39] <Juerd> eric256: A list cannot exist in non-list context, and in list context, everything is a list.

[20:39] <Juerd> eric256: The "list" operator is dubious and should generally be ignored, IMO

[20:39] <eric256> ?eval (1).sum

[20:39] <PerlJam> Juerd: doesn't that make the builtin "list" operator a list constructor?  :)

[20:39] <Juerd> (I cannot think of any reason to have or use it)

[20:39] <eric256> ?eval (1,2).sum

[20:40] <eric256> here bot...here bot

[20:40] <Juerd> PerlJam: Yes, but it makes lists be things, which makes no sense with the rest of the language

[20:40] <Juerd> PerlJam: I have yet to see a single instance of the list operator being needed or handy.

[20:40] <PerlJam> Maybe if list were a long-hand way to write the splatty *

[20:40] <eric256> it just seems weird to me that the two above eval statmenst are soo different, first one is. 1.sum while the second is (1,2).sum

[20:40] <Juerd> As far as I understand the logic, "list" is there for theoretical completeness, except that it is based on partial theory rather than the whole of Perl.

[20:41] <Juerd> PerlJam: That'd be very, very misleading.

[20:43] <iblech> eric256: (Need to sleep soon, so can only stay here for a short time) (2) is in every aspect the same as 2, i.e. it's a plain scalar.

[20:43] <eric256> right. but (1,2) is not. which is what is confusing to me

[20:43] <Juerd> eric256: (1,2) cannot be a plain scalar.

[20:43] <iblech> Yep. (1,2) is an array, whose elements are aliases to the original vars -- ($foo,$bar)[0] =:= $foo is true

[20:43] <Juerd> eric256: It is the comma operator in either scalar or list context (or void)

[20:44] <iblech> (Also, (1,) is an array as well.)

[20:44] <eric256> and if you are coding then they look like they should be the same. i can understand and live with it, just misleading. but as was pointed out thats the way it is in perl5 too.

[20:46] <iblech> Well, you can use this behaviour for clarity etc. -- ( long_expression ).foobar may be better than long_expression.foobar. And the parens are actually needed if you have to group things, think (~$foo).uc. If (~$foo) meant (~$foo,), (~$foo).uc couldn't work

[20:46] <eric256> true.

[20:49] <Juerd> Sure it could

[20:49] <svnbot6> r7664 | fglock++ |   "my @a = 1..Inf; @a.pop;" returns Inf

[20:49] <Juerd> But it'd require more radical consistency.

[20:50] <iblech> oooh fglock__++

[21:01] <svnbot6> r7665 | iblech++ | Pugs.Prim: Fixed .perl for arrays containing only one elem, eric256++:

[21:01] <svnbot6> r7665 | iblech++ |   (3,).perl     # (3,), *not* (3)

[21:02] <iblech> Ok, sleep. Night all! :)

[21:05] <nothingm1ch> http://www.javacoolsoftware.com/eulalyzer.html

[21:07] <geoffb> Okay . . . that such a product has a niche is just disturbing

[21:08] <eric256> lol

[21:11] * eric256 begins to fear one of his *fixes* killed eval bot....;(

[21:17] <buu> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

[21:17] <eric256> ?

[21:27] <eric256> yea my fix isn't the one that killed eval bot!! ;)

[21:27] <eric256> endeclared variable $?SELF

[21:54] <eric256> hehe. stock in a company we where considering getting a phone system from is now trading at  0.011 lol. should by a 100 shares just in case it goes up. lol

[22:16] <Khisanth> 1cent a share?

[22:16] <eric256> slightly more. lol but yea

[22:17] <eric256> we decided they might not be the most financialy secure company to do business with (not just based on share price but that left a real after taste )

[22:23] * eric256 sees undeclarded variable $?SELF while trying .trans

[22:23] <eric256> anyone know what broke that?

[22:24] <eric256> looks like iblech aded an alias...but would that break $?SELF?  hmm

[22:27] <wolverian> eric256, Larry doesn't like $?SELF now. ie: $?CLASS is static, $?SELF is dynamic

[22:28] <wolverian> eric256, for now, just call it 'self'

[22:28] <eric256> lots of broken code then

[22:28] <wolverian> trivial to fix.

[22:29] <eric256> you might think so....but why does .trans fail now?  that sub doesn't have $?SELF anywhere in it

[22:30] <wolverian> right.

[22:30] <wolverian> I don't know. :)

[22:30] <eric256> lol

[22:36] <eric256> okay something went wrong...its mad about $self....plan old user variable...

[22:38] <pasteling> "eric256" at 66.102.136.66 pasted "Odd $self behaviour" (6 lines, 207B) at http://sial.org/pbot/13762

[22:39] * eric256 guesses that the rule is disregarding the $ for some reason

[22:39] <eric256> so it thinks i'm calling $?SELF when in fact i'm calling $self....anyone familary with rules? ;)

[22:43] <eric256> we should just call it $elf and be done. ;)

[22:47] <wolverian> :)

[22:48] <eric256> are there any other barewords like that that i can look to for reference?

[22:51] <eric256> wolverian...you don't know of any? come on! lol

[22:52] <eric256> i don't even know why its droping the darn $...must be some way to get around this..lol

[23:18] <geoffb> eric256 was clearly in a punchy mood, judging by the random bouts of laughter.  :-)

[23:19] <buu> LOL

[23:19] <buu> !

[23:23] <wolverian> buu, looool!

[23:23] <buu> lawl

[23:24] <Shillo> Hehe. :)

[23:36] <luqui> ?eval class Foo { method bar() { say $?SELF } }  Foo.new.bar

[23:36] <luqui> oh, evalbot's not here

[23:37] <Juerd> Hello

[23:37] <Juerd> Is this the helpdesk?

[23:37] <Juerd> Good

[23:37] <Juerd> I have a problem.

[23:37] <Juerd> My mouse mat doesn't work.

[23:38] <Juerd> pad even

[23:38] <luqui> er

[23:38] <luqui> ?

[23:38] <Juerd> I've tried everything. It does nothing.

[23:39] <Juerd> Can you help me?

[23:39] <Juerd> afk  # good night :)

[23:40] <geoffb> Juerd, nothingm1ch: I got some (very tentative) interest from O'Reilly re: _Migrating to Perl 6_, so that's encouraging.

[23:40] <geoffb> My reading of it was that if the community builds it, they would probably come.

[23:42] <geoffb> But my previous experience is that the cleaner it is (so less work required on their end), probably the better deal we could get for the community.

[23:44] <obra> geoffb: also, what about copyright issues?

[23:44] <obra> IE, what kinds of waivers do you need?

[23:45] <Juerd> geoffb: Then let it be clean by setting strict guidelines and having a few people rewrite everything afterwards.

[23:45] <geoffb> obra, that's a good question.  I understand little about the real pro and con of that sort of thing.

[23:45] <Juerd> geoffb: In general, it's good news.

[23:46] <geoffb> Juerd, I agree.

[23:46] <Juerd> obra: They can publish something that is free documentation.

[23:46] <Juerd> obra: They won't want to initially, but they should get used to this anyway.

[23:46] <geoffb> obra, I'm thinking that since there is nothing relating to other kinds of IP law than copyright, then at worst if it became an issue, we'd just rewrite.  But best to probably start

[23:46] <geoffb> with giving people a clear picture of the intentions, as nothingm1ch began to do.

[23:47] <Juerd> obra: Their book has advantages over the same info elsewhere, and THAT is why people buy books.

[23:47] <geoffb> Juerd, I thought they already do publish several free books?

[23:47] <Juerd> geoffb: Yes, but they were always freed afterwards, as far as I know

[23:47] <geoffb> Juerd, nodnod

[23:48] <Juerd> Just make it creativecommons with attribution

[23:48] <Juerd> Write a substantial part and you get published almost automatically, listed as author.

[23:48] <Juerd> That's very attractive, I think :)

[23:48] <geoffb> Juerd, I'm assuming CC Att/SA not appropriate?

[23:49] <Juerd> SA is not enforcable.

[23:49] <obra> right. free isn't an issue

[23:49] <geoffb> Juerd, please explain, why not?

[23:49] <obra> not being clear that the "authors" have the IP rights to the text can be

[23:49] <Juerd> geoffb: Hard to find, hard to detect, especially with lots of copies floating around

[23:50] <Juerd> geoffb: And there's no good way to sue offenders

[23:50] <geoffb> geoffb, right, but can you still enforce against someone being obviously bad in public?

[23:50] <Juerd> geoffb: It doesn't matter much anyway

[23:50] <obra> All I'm suggesting is that someone ask ORA up front what their standards are for collectively edited books

[23:50] <Juerd> Attribution is also not enforcable, but at least gives a big fish like O'Reilly the requirement to publish names

[23:51] <Juerd> Appendix A - AUTHORS

[23:51] <geoffb> Juerd, gotcha

[23:51] <Juerd> :)

[23:52] <Juerd> Anyway, I was going to bed

[23:52] <Juerd> Bye

[23:52] <geoffb> g'night Juerd 

[23:54] <geoffb> FWIW, O'Reilly blogs are now under CC Att / NC / SA 2.5, with ownership to the authors.

[23:54] <geoffb> So clearly O'Reilly is accepting CC in at least some ways
