[00:02] <Juerd> buu: Hm?

[00:03] <Juerd> wolverian: You can use the mail server on feather if you wish

[00:03] <Juerd> wolverian: If it's temporary

[00:03] <buu> Juerd: You are freaky.

[00:04] <Juerd> wolverian: ssh -L 2525:127.0.0.1:25 feather.perl6.nl, then use localhost:2525 while the ssh connection lasts

[00:04] <Juerd> buu: Why?

[00:06] <wolverian> Juerd, nah, it'll pass, I think. I'm too tired to start doing weird stuff now. :) I'm just wondering when postfix will pick it up again from deferred...

[00:07] <Juerd> wolverian: weird?

[00:07] <buu> Juerd: 'oliebol'

[00:07] <wolverian> Juerd, as in, 'things I haven't done before'

[00:07] <Juerd> wolverian: It's a port forward. ssh listens locally (-L), and connects on the remote host

[00:07] <Juerd> wolverian: And the rest of ssh you probably did use before. Or so I hope.

[00:07] <wolverian> Juerd, oh, right - I don't have to configure anything locally?

[00:07] <Juerd> wolverian: Indeed

[00:08] <Juerd> wolverian: Well, your MTA or MUA, to use the forwarded connection (localhost:2525)

[00:08] <wolverian> right

[00:15] <Juerd> buu: Oh, that's a dutch old/new year's delecasy (tastes like a sponge, though)

[00:15] <Juerd> buu: The fun is that you can type 7083170 on a calculator, rotate it 180, and see this word.

[00:15] <buu> Juerd: Fascinating!

[00:15] <wolverian> hmm.

[00:15] <Juerd> buu: Likewise, lol + lol results in hihi. "lol" is Dutch for "fun", "hihi" sounds like "heehee", giggling.

[00:16] <Juerd> buu: Even better: "heleboel" (73083734), which means "a great many"

[00:16] <Juerd> Which, for a number, is very meaningful

[00:16] <wolverian> shouldn't a bounced message come back to me?

[00:17] <Juerd> wolverian: Yes, but very often the "me" isn't so clear.

[00:17] <wolverian> right. 

[00:17] <Juerd> wolverian: Are you using feather now?

[00:17] <wolverian> no. I just think I've misconfigured the envelope address again here.

[00:17] <Juerd> I can have a look in the logs if you want

[00:17] <Juerd> Oh, ok

[00:17] <wolverian> I forgot what to do with it.

[00:17] <Juerd> Ah,Ah

[00:17] <Juerd> s/Ah,//

[00:17] <wolverian> and it's bouncing to the e-mail address that this server does _not_ deliver for 

[00:17] <Juerd> The envelope from is important, yes :)

[00:18] <buu> holy fucking shit

[00:18] <wolverian> how did I set that up, again?

[00:18] <wolverian> sorry to be such a bother

[00:18] <Juerd> How should I know? I don't remember all that stuff :)

[00:18] <wolverian> at least this time I figured what's wrong myself

[00:18] <wolverian> hehe :)

[00:18] <Juerd> buu: Hm? :)

[00:18] <buu> Juerd: It's saturday =[

[00:19] <Juerd> wolverian: On an average day, I help out four to five people on IRC. I really do not remember much of it afterwards.

[00:19] <wolverian> :)

[00:19] <buu> I thought it was still friday

[00:19] <buu> Holy shit!

[00:19] <wolverian> okay, man 5 postconf helps. thanks

[00:19] <Juerd> buu: It's Sunday here.

[00:19] <buu> Juerd: I'm actually at work!

[00:19] <Juerd> buu: So was I, an hour ago.

[00:20] <buu> Juerd: I shouldn't be!

[00:20] <Juerd> For personal matters, but still

[00:20] <wolverian> hmm. 

[00:20] <Juerd> I want a sheet of orange reflector plastic.

[00:20] <Juerd> Why is that so hard to find?

[00:20] <wolverian> what should I put in as the envelope from?

[00:20] <wolverian> wolverian@localhost? :)

[00:20] <Juerd> wolverian: The address you want bounces delivered to.

[00:20] <wolverian> well

[00:21] <wolverian> that's actually fine as it is now

[00:21] <Juerd> wolverian: And preferably, the same address you use in the From: header, if you care (I have it set to something different on purpose)

[00:21] <wolverian> it's just that when my postfix can't connect to the relay, it's bouncing things to an address it can't deliver to

[00:21] <Juerd> wolverian: @localhost not. It must be externally deliverable.

[00:21] <wolverian> (since it would have to go through the relay)

[00:21] <wolverian> which is weird. I would have thought the canonical mapping would have kicked in

[00:22] <Juerd> wolverian: Ah, the relay is the server that also happens to handle mail for the envelope from domain?

[00:22] <Juerd> wolverian: 'cause that's a classic example of why that shouldn't be the same :)

[00:22] <wolverian> Juerd, no, it's not. :)

[00:22] <Juerd> (It very commonly is, though)

[00:22] <Juerd> I don't know postfix. Last time I tried, I found it way too complex.

[00:23] <wolverian> Juerd, the server postfix runs on is non-deliverable (it uses fetchmail). it fetches mail from helsinki.fi, and relays to mail.inet.fi 

[00:23] <Juerd> I know the protocol in detail, I know how many unix things work, but that wasn't enough to grok postfix.

[00:23] <wolverian> if mail.inet.fi bounces, postfix tries to send through it again, to my helsinki.fi address

[00:23] <wolverian> which is obviously retarded.

[00:23] <wolverian> Juerd, right.

[00:23] <Juerd> I prefer qmail :)

[00:24] <wolverian> I tried to make it play nice with the university relay as well

[00:24] <wolverian> but I just could not make the SSL auth work.

[00:24] <Juerd> wolverian: Why is that retarded? I fail to see the obviousness.

[00:24] <wolverian> Juerd, oh. it's retarded because the relay is itself broken 

[00:24] <wolverian> Juerd, I guess it can't know that.

[00:24] <wolverian> s,it,postfix,

[00:24] <Juerd> wolverian: That has nothing to do with the other configuration though :)

[00:24] <Juerd> wolverian: You should have multiple relays :)

[00:24] <wolverian> right.

[00:25] <Juerd> Not that that is possible for most people

[00:25] <wolverian> I'd use the university one if postfix would just connect to it

[00:25] <wolverian> but I get a VERY unhelpful "Connection closed."

[00:25] <Juerd> Use a proxy

[00:25] <Juerd> And listen locally, unencrypted

[00:25] <Juerd> Move the SSL out of the complex beast into something you can debug.

[00:26] <wolverian> argh. :)

[00:26] <wolverian> I don't know the protocol well enough yet

[00:26] <wolverian> to feel safe doing that

[00:26] <wolverian> albeit I guess CPAN has something to do exactly that

[00:27] <Juerd> it goes like helo, 2xx, mail from: [email@hidden.address] 2xx, rcpt to: [email@hidden.address] 2xx, data, Subject: Hello, World\n\nHi!\n.\n

[00:27] <wolverian> auth?

[00:27] <Juerd> 2xx

[00:27] <Juerd> wolverian: Oh, you need authentication. That sucks :)

[00:27] <wolverian> I _think_ I do.

[00:28] <Juerd> Don't think before trying

[00:28] <wolverian> I don't know what SASL is and if I need that, or just SSL, or if they are the same thing

[00:28] <Juerd> Hm

[00:28] <Juerd> Usually I give opposite advice.

[00:28] <wolverian> hehe. ;)

[00:28] <Juerd> But in this case trying won't hurt

[00:28] <wolverian> right

[00:28] <Juerd> SASL is smtp auth.

[00:28] <Juerd> Not related to SSL

[00:28] <Juerd> Except for spelling

[00:30] <wolverian> ah. thanks

[00:31] <wolverian> I need TLS, I think.

[00:31] <Juerd> TLS is SSL, practically

[00:31] <Juerd> It's newer.

[00:31] <Juerd> Very often, when people say SSL, they mean TLS

[00:31] <wolverian> yeah, knew that. I just think I tried it already

[00:31] <wolverian> maybe my ISP doesn't like :25 though

[00:31] <wolverian> (sucks)

[00:32] <Juerd> I have a so much easier setup

[00:32] <Juerd> An always-connected, always-on box that's entirely publicly reachable.

[00:32] <wolverian> but you have a host that is deliverable, right? :)

[00:32] <wolverian> right. :)

[00:32] <wolverian> I would use the university server and run mutt there, but it's SunOS and entirely fucked up.

[00:32] <Juerd> I get to ssh to it and read my mail from anywhere

[00:32] <wolverian> its procmail is from 1995, or something like that.

[00:33] <Juerd> 1995 didn't have enough spam for procmail to be designed for it :)

[00:33] <Juerd> Same for sendmail

[00:34] <Juerd> Be big, fork a lot, use memory, be generally inefficient? Sure, why not?

[00:34] <wolverian> wait, I also need to authenticate

[00:34] <Juerd> Oh, and security? Why'd you waste your time on that.

[00:34] <wolverian> is that SASL?

[00:34] <Juerd> Very probably

[00:34] <wolverian> argh.

[00:34] <Juerd> Authentication on a relay. I've never used that.

[00:35] <Juerd> I'm used to IP-based authorization on relays.

[00:35] <wolverian> it's for the intraweb only, outsiders have to auth

[00:35] <wolverian> intranet, rather

[00:36] <Juerd> That's the common setup, yes

[00:39] <wolverian> this is so ridiculously complex compared to just using, say, Evolution

[00:39] <wolverian> I'm a sucker for using mutt. 

[00:39] <wolverian> :)

[00:40] <wolverian> s,using mutt,following the unix 

[00:40] <wolverian> mail principles,

[00:40] <wolverian> thankyou enter.

[00:46] <Juerd> Trying to follow unix mail principles in a very limited environment

[00:46] <wolverian> true enough

[00:46] <Juerd> Unix is nice, but it doesn't cope very well with being disconnected

[00:46] <wolverian> I just want to see my mail whenever I screen -r :)

[00:47] <Juerd> Of course!

[00:47] <Juerd> Best advice I can give you is to get a shell account on a well connected box somewhere.

[00:48] <wolverian> like feather? :)

[00:48] <Juerd> Yes, but not like feather in that feather is for Perl 6 stuff only

[00:49] <wolverian> yeah. it's not that my box isn't connected - it just doesn't have a name

[00:49] <wolverian> (that others could see :)

[00:49] <Juerd> Then get a hostname.

[00:49] <Juerd> There are a million ways to do this.

[00:49] <Juerd> Including a few dozen free dynamic dns services

[00:49] <wolverian> I'm a poor student etc. yeah, I will.

[00:50] <Juerd> More important is that you can receive connections on port 25

[00:50] <Juerd> Many ISPs block this

[00:50] <Juerd> That's because most servers are by default open relays.

[00:50] <wolverian> oh, but if I want the box to be deliverable, dyndns isn't enough, is it?

[00:50] <Juerd> dyndns would be enough, provided that ingress port 25 is not blocked.

[00:51] <wolverian> it is not

[00:51] <Juerd> When mail is delivered, the MX record is checked first

[00:51] <Juerd> If there is no MX record, the A record is used.

[00:51] <wolverian> and I do have a dynamic address 

[00:51] <Juerd> feather.perl6.nl has no MX record. It doesn't need any, because the same box handles mail.

[00:51] <Juerd> What's the address?

[00:51] <wolverian> chronoa.dy.fi

[00:52] <Juerd> Remote host said: 554 [email@hidden.address] Relay access denied

[00:52] <Juerd> Okay, now start accepting mail for it :)

[00:52] <wolverian> heh.

[00:52] <wolverian> dy.fi also allows me to set an MX record

[00:52] <wolverian> which isn't needed, I guess.

[00:52] <Juerd> You don't need any

[00:53] <wolverian> right.

[00:53] <Juerd> That's for when the mail server is ANOTHER host

[00:53] <wolverian> I think I'd only use [email@hidden.address] as the envelope from, though

[00:53] <wolverian> hm.

[00:53] <Juerd> That's very possible

[00:53] <Juerd> And possibly a good idea

[00:53] <Juerd> I use a different envelope from because I want to kill all bounces that are sent to other addresses :)

[00:53] <wolverian> right

[00:54] <Juerd> (This prevents lots of spam and spam bounces)

[00:54] <wolverian> it also prevents from bounces being bounced back because there's only one relay

[00:54] <Juerd> Lots in my case being a few hundred messages per day, on peak days

[00:54] <wolverian> (which is broken)

[00:54] <Juerd> It's still not accepting mail ;)

[00:55] <wolverian> heh.

[00:55] <wolverian> I'm still thinking about this

[00:55] <wolverian> because, for me, it only fixes the particular situation that the relay is broken

[00:55] <wolverian> it might be better to just find more relays

[00:55] <Juerd> It also makes bounces more reliable

[00:56] <Juerd> Because there's a step less.

[00:56] <wolverian> true

[00:56] <Juerd> It makes bounces be push, rather than pull

[00:56] <Juerd> Which means you get them sooner. Which means you can react quicker, and waste less of other people's time.

[00:57] <Juerd> And it makes local configuration mistakes not travel to your provider, only to find out that this doesn't work either :)

[00:57] <Juerd> In other words: debug info! :)

[01:11] <Juerd> Good night

[02:36] <Cryptic_K> bbl

[07:33] <autrijus> good morning!

[08:44] <autrijus> I think you can fix it in no time

[08:44] <Khisanth> "you report it, you fix it!"

[08:44] <sky_> autrijus: if you go on http://evakitty.evaair.com/ with me

[08:44] <autrijus> that will also motivate you to add your name to AUTHORS

[08:44] <sky_> :p

[08:47] <autrijus> oh well, I fixed it :) r7701

[08:47] <sky_> crap, I was trying to :)

[08:49] <autrijus> sorry for my impatience :)

[08:51] <autrijus> ski != sky

[08:51] <xerox> Whoops.

[08:51] <xerox> S K I :-)

[09:41] <xerox> Still playing with Â¥... how can I get its type?  I tried with ref but I couldn't succeed.

[09:42] <Khisanth> not sure if that sort of thing has been "specced" yet :)

[09:42] <xerox> Woot.

[09:43] <xerox> That's why it works both on '0' and '(0)' ?

[09:43] <Khisanth> not sure what you mean by that

[09:43] <xerox> Isn't  0 :: Int and  (0) :: list of Ints ?

[09:43] <integral> is there a difference between 0 and (0) as rvalues?

[09:44] <Khisanth> 0 and (0) are both a list one item :)

[09:44] <xerox> Hm.

[09:44] <integral> () isn't a list constructor, xerox.  That's more ,'s job

[09:44] <xerox> Ah.

[09:44] <integral> but OTOH on a left-hand side (where context comes from) () can sometimes make the context jump from item to list afaik

[09:45] <xerox> And a string is not a list, too?

[09:45] <integral> of course not ;-)

[09:45] <xerox> :-|

[09:46] <integral> and list in perl doesn't really mean cons-list like in scheme/haskell

[09:46] <xerox> Sadly :-)

[09:46] <integral> hmm, I'm not sure.   I prefer to hide it's structual recursion inside map/fold, which is just like using for/map in perl

[09:48] <xerox> What's the most common/used data structure in perl6?

[09:48] <Khisanth> hash, array and scalar? ;)

[09:48] <xerox> Hmm, it probably could sound as a stupid question - but I mean like how lists are heavily used in Haskell programs, or such.

[09:49] <xerox> Ooh-kay.

[09:49] <xerox> I just can't find something to play with :-)

[10:07] <xerox> Is there a way to do .pod => whatever_looks_nice_enough ?

[10:10] <rafl> spinclad: Thanks for the report

[10:11] <scook0> xerox: trying to read PODs?

[10:11] <scook0> I usually use pod2man or pod2html

[10:13] <integral> perldoc does the normal manpage type viewing of pod

[10:13] <xerox> scook0: Yes, I am.  I'll try, thanks.

[10:45] <rafl> Is there a way to tag something using svk without using the normal trunk/, tags/ layout of subversion?

[10:48] <integral> sure, just make up a work which isn't trunk, tags, etc.  I just copy stuff into my own //branches/foobar

[10:53] <rafl> integral: Well, that's only local then, isn't it?

[10:53] <integral> sure

[10:54] <rafl> Well, that doesn't help me.

[10:54] <integral> but as another answer, you can use a copy from anywhere to anywhere to "tag" something. you don't need the standard layout

[10:55] <rafl> Yes, of course.

[10:55] <integral> Well both of those things answer you question...

[10:57] <rafl> Yes, thought I could avoid copying and therfor changing the layout.

[10:57] <integral> I suppose you could write down revision numbers on a piece of paper ;-)

[10:58] <rafl> I suppose I can't. I don't even have a pen.. :-)

[10:58] <integral> heh

[14:36] <petykoo> hi

[14:39] <petykoo> is this perl6.2.10 "stable", or just development yet?

[14:40] <wolverian> development.

[14:40] <wolverian> there is no perl6.2.10, only pugs 6.2.10

[14:40] <wolverian> see http://www.pugscode.org

[14:41] <petykoo> ok

[14:41] <petykoo> and is it known when will be the 6.0.0 perl?

[14:41] <petykoo> or a roadmap or sg like that?

[14:42] <wolverian> the pugs roadmap is on pugscode.org

[14:43] <petykoo> coz there were interesting perfomances on the 1st hungarian perl conf, and i want to learn perl, but decided to wait till 6, coz it will be much different from the current 5

[14:48] <petykoo> or is it usable now?

[14:48] <wolverian> it'll be a while before the stable release of perl6. in the meantime, you can use pugs, which is not complete but does run many perl6 programs already.

[14:49] <petykoo> ok

[14:49] <moskvax> i was thinking about that sort of thing actually

[14:49] <petykoo> i think i can wait...

[14:50] <moskvax> i guess it isn't really worth starting to learn perl 5 now when much of it will change

[14:50] <Juerd> It is

[14:50] <moskvax> but i can't find anything written about perl 6 towards someone who knows no perl 5

[14:50] <Juerd> It'll take quite some time before 6 is out

[14:51] <Juerd> And knowing 5 will help you understand 6

[14:51] <petykoo> hmm

[14:51] <Juerd> The first books released will probably focus on people moving from 5 to 6

[14:51] <petykoo> but if i start to learn perl5 and regex and stuff, i can drop almost the half of my knowledge...

[14:52] <petykoo> i'll have to, i mean

[14:52] <Juerd> No

[14:52] <Juerd> You'll have skills. And skills have nothing to do with the language in question

[14:52] <Juerd> The ways of writing things change, the underlying principles and ideas do not

[14:53] <QtPlatypus> petykoo: No perl5 regexes are more or less a subset of perl6 rules

[14:53] <petykoo> yea?

[14:53] <Juerd> Yep

[14:53] <Juerd> Notation changes

[14:53] <Juerd> What you can do, and how you do that, does not

[14:53] <Juerd> Except, of course, that in Perl 6 you can do a lot more

[14:54] <stevan_> autrijus: ping

[14:54] <petykoo> hmm...

[14:54] *** stevan_ is now known as stevan

[14:54] <Juerd> petykoo: It will only get more readable.

[14:54] <petykoo> maybe i'll should try out anyway..

[14:54] <Juerd> petykoo: /(?=foo)/ changes to /<before foo>/

[14:55] <Juerd> petykoo: http://learn.perl.org/library/beginning_perl/ is a good book for beginners.

[14:55] <petykoo> thanks, i gotta go, but i'll be back in minutes

[14:56] <moskvax> Juerd: thanks for the information

[14:57] <autrijus> #2 about to be on

[14:57] <stevan> autrijus: nice

[14:57] <stevan> autrijus: so i assume you dont have a moment

[14:57] <autrijus> you can type away

[14:58] <autrijus> but I'll be able to properly respond only when I'm back to hotel

[14:58] <autrijus> which is ~1hr from now

[14:58] <autrijus> sorry about those conferences :/

[14:58] <stevan> I am composing a p6c email, I think that will be a better forum :) 

[14:58] <autrijus> (but I try to remedy by signing on new committers)

[14:58] <autrijus> good, we should use p6c more :)

[14:58] <stevan> autrijus: don't apologize,.. you are our spokesman

[14:58] <Juerd> autrijus++  # propagates ideas and wisdom IRL

[14:58] <petykoo> i'm back

[14:58] <stevan> hey nothingmuch 

[14:59] <autrijus> turns out I'm speaking again in copenhagen this thursday

[14:59] * autrijus is feeling like Damian

[14:59] <nothingmuch> hi ho

[14:59] <petykoo> Juerd: so, you say perl6 will be more speaky?:)

[14:59] <nothingmuch> like damian?

[14:59] <Juerd> petykoo: Perl 6 rules will certainly be

[14:59] <petykoo> OK

[14:59] <stevan> autrijus: if only you could get paid (well) for all these speaking engagements

[14:59] <Juerd> petykoo: Perl 6 for the rest of the language will be in some points, and be more concise in others

[15:00] <autrijus> stevan: nah, it's all outofpocket

[15:00] <autrijus> stevan: I'm getting good at travelling cheap :)

[15:00] * stevan thinks maybe we should divert pugs resources to write a TPF grant

[15:00] <nothingmuch> so what's been up this week?

[15:00] <stevan> or even better

[15:00] * nothingmuch has had a big deadline and has been giving his spare time to catalyst lately

[15:01] <autrijus> nothingmuch: I talked with kane about policy files and multiversioning

[15:01] <nothingmuch> policy files?

[15:01] <autrijus> synced with obra about bringing it back and proto in p5

[15:01] <stevan> if we can figure out how perl6 can fight terrorism, then we can get a DARPA US gov grant

[15:01] <autrijus> and talked with sky about -BPerl5Optimized

[15:01] <Juerd> stevan: Give terrorists committer bits; that'll keep 'em off the streets! :)

[15:01] <autrijus> nothingmuch: policy files are what you use to decide which DBI to use out of the 16,384 DBIs instealled

[15:01] <nothingmuch> ah

[15:02] <autrijus> mm, "instealled". nice typo

[15:02] <nothingmuch> -BPerl5Optimized sounds interesting

[15:02] <autrijus> nothingmuch: yeah, involve handcrafted OPs

[15:02] <nothingmuch> perl 5 ops for PIL?

[15:02] <autrijus> yes

[15:02] <autrijus> goal being keeping p5 a "Production" VM for p6

[15:02] <nothingmuch> woot!

[15:02] <Juerd> I still thinks that different modules with the same name will not work too great, if only for discussion

[15:02] <autrijus> instead of just a "good to have backcompat"

[15:03] <Juerd> Imagine #perlhelp. "Okay, nice, but before we can help you. Please answer these questions: What DBI is that? Which CGI module do you use? Is that LWP's HTTP::Headers, and if so: which LWP?"

[15:04] <autrijus> "the CPAN one, of course!"

[15:04] * stevan goes to compose some p6c ramblings

[15:05] <stevan> &

[15:05] <autrijus> Juerd: I think most people will use the default policy file shipped with perl.

[15:05] <autrijus> which would prefer cpan: 

[15:05] <autrijus> I hope, at least.

[15:05] <Juerd> I think and hope all will

[15:05] <Juerd> Which defeats the entire purpose

[15:05] <autrijus> nope

[15:06] <autrijus> good by default, customizable if needed

[15:06] <Juerd> It's never needed

[15:06] <Juerd> Because you can load any module with any alias

[15:06] <autrijus> I think that's where people differ :)

[15:06] <Juerd> use MyDBI as DBI

[15:06] <Juerd> Whichever the spelling of 'as' will be.

[15:06] <autrijus> use perl5:DBI as DBI;

[15:06] <autrijus> yeah, true

[15:08] <autrijus> Juerd: I think having the ability to install DBI 1.46 and DBI 1.99 makes sense.

[15:08] <Juerd> So do I

[15:08] <petykoo> thanks, bye

[15:08] <Juerd> But those are the versions of the same module

[15:08] <Juerd> Rather than different modules having the same name

[15:08] <Juerd> Anyway

[15:09] <Juerd> afk  # bathroom's free. MY TURN! WOOOO.

[15:09] * xerox feels Juerd

[15:12] <autrijus> Juerd: I think DBI-1.34-cpan:AUTRIJUS and DBI-1.56-cpan:JUERD can be safely thought of versions of the same module too.

[15:12] <autrijus> in my mind it's simply that the versionspec is now namespaced.

[15:12] <autrijus> but they still need to mean, "conceptually", "the same thing"

[15:29] <autrijus> hey Liz!

[15:29] <Liz> hi Autrijus

[15:30] <autrijus> I'm about to go on NPW lightning talk in 1 min :)

[15:30] <Liz> thought I'd come and have a look...  ;-)

[15:30] <autrijus> (will be back in a bit)

[15:30] <autrijus> sure!

[15:30] <Liz> ok

[15:30] <Liz> have fun!

[15:30] <autrijus> ?eval 'Liz++' xx 10

[15:30] <xerox> haha

[15:30] <xerox> ?eval "foo" x 2

[15:30] <evalbot_7703> "foofoo" 

[15:30] <xerox> ooooh.

[15:46] <glasser> ?eval "foo" xxx 3

[15:46] <evalbot_7703> Error:  unexpected "x" expecting operator, postfix conditional, postfix loop, postfix iteration, ";" or end of input 

[15:49] <xerox> hah

[15:49] <xerox> powersets? :P

[15:52] <glasser> that, or porn.

[16:25] <Juerd> Hi Liz

[16:25] <Liz> hi Juerd...

[16:25] <Juerd> Good to see you here :)

[16:25] <Liz> yep... good to be here...

[16:26] <Liz> don't expect too much from me though...  ;-)

[16:26] <Juerd> I have no expectations

[16:26] <Juerd> I think people mostly see what they do here as fun, not as work.

[16:26] <Juerd> Or at least fun work

[16:26] <Liz> well, then you expect fun, don't you?

[16:27] <Liz> ;-)

[16:27] <Juerd> Hm

[16:27] <Juerd> Well, I expect conditionally :)

[16:27] <Juerd> IF you do stuff, it better be fun to you.

[16:27] <Liz> true...

[16:27] <integral> ?eval my $n = 0;  sub hello_thread { async { say "hello #" ~ $n++ } } for 1..4 { hello_thread };

[16:27] <evalbot_7703> hello #0 hello #1 hello #2 undef 

[16:28] <Liz> hmmm...

[16:28] <Juerd> There's a thread missing :)

[16:28] <integral> I think it just doesn't get a chance to run

[16:29] <integral> and no sleep in evalbot

[16:29] <Juerd> integral: Try a sleep then

[16:29] <Juerd> Oh.

[16:29] <Juerd> Then a commodore 64 like sleep: "" for 1..15000 :)

[16:29] <Juerd> Though 15000 may be a bit too much for pugs; I don't know

[16:29] <integral> heh, we need an optimizer to spoil that trick

[16:30] <Juerd> And since there is no optimizer :)

[16:30] <integral> although I don't think that particular optimisation is that hard a one

[16:32] <Juerd> I think it's a pointless thing to waste optimizer time on

[16:32] <Juerd> It's not something you write on purpose without the purpose.

[16:33] <integral> Juerd: hmm, well it's just constant in void context -> noop (perl5 does this), and then eliminating a loop with a empty loop body

[16:34] <stevan> autrijus: p6c Object Space post is off,.. please respond with your comments :)

[16:35] <Juerd> integral: The loop with the empty body elimination is what I think is pointless :)

[16:35] * Aankhen`` goes to sleep.

[16:35] <Aankhen``> G'night.

[16:35] <Juerd> integral: OTOH, for (1..much) { if (known to be false) { ... } } to be optimized away would be nice

[16:35] <integral> hmm, yeah, I can't think of a case where you'd get an empty loop body after some other optimisation

[16:35] <Juerd> integral: Forget I said anything

[16:35] <integral> ah, that's a good one!

[16:36] <Juerd> But!

[16:36] <Juerd> We should discuss whether infinite and could-be-infinite loops should be optimized away.

[16:36] <Juerd> Or perhaps an infinite empty loop should just die

[16:36] <integral> ah, yes, that's a nasty one.  I suppose the middle ground is ... yeah that

[16:37] <Juerd> We have sleep for that.

[16:37] <integral> but when should it die?  as early as possible or as late as possible?

[16:37] <Juerd> At optimization time.

[16:37] <Juerd> i.e. as early as possible

[16:37] <Juerd> Certain death must always be asap

[16:38] <Juerd> There's no point in executing the program if you know there will be a fatal exception later on.

[16:38] <integral> should that rule be applied to typechecking too?  like if you've got: my $a = 5; $a.bark(); # should this die as early-as-possible?

[16:38] <Juerd> And doing so would unnecessarily execute potential impurity

[16:38] <integral> Juerd: there's the if (0) { while (1) { } } case, should that die when detected?

[16:39] <integral> and that one might even depend on the order of the two optimisations

[16:39] <Juerd> Yes, but "as early as possible", in the case of types, is still runtime.

[16:39] <Juerd> (Unless you specify the pragma that promises you're not going to change types)

[16:39] <integral> Juerd: ah, well I'd perfer it to be speced using words liek "as early as possible" so that when typechecking appears, people aren't surprised

[16:39] <integral> hrm

[16:40] <Juerd> integral: No. If there's an explicit if (0) { ... }, always count that as meant to be a temporary multiline comment

[16:40] <integral> Juerd: and if (SOME_CONSTANT) { ... }?

[16:41] <Juerd> integral: Dubious, but throw away the body for different reasons: looking through all of it, just to find warnings is a waste of time.

[16:41] <integral> hmm, maybe there would be a "lint" flag to the compiler, which would do more extensive tests like this

[16:42] <Juerd> The optimizer pass must be very quick, or optimization makes the program slower than without.

[16:42] <integral> eg.  if SOME_CONSTANT is predicated on platform, you can catch it all on your dev machine, without testing it on all platforms

[16:42] <Juerd> That is a nice idea

[16:42] <Juerd> It could just be a standard test though

[16:43] <integral> maybe this is perl6's equivalent of use strict, or use warnings/-w

[16:43] <Juerd> No, those two shouldn't have great effect on processing time.

[16:44] <Juerd> All of Perl is modular. A test can access the parser and the optimizer. Add a flag to the optimizer call, and have this be a t/stupidity.t

[16:44] <integral> hmm, maybe the spec shouldn't say "as early as possible", but instead "the compiler is allowed to die earlier than runtime, if it feels like it"

[16:44] <Juerd> No

[16:45] <Juerd> "as early as possible" is precise

[16:45] <Juerd> "it feels like it" is very imprecise

[16:45] <integral> yes, intentionally

[16:45] <integral> then you can vary whether infinite loops die at optimiser time, if you're doing batch compilation, or run-time if you're compiling just before running

[16:45] <Juerd> This makes every bug a "it felt like it" case

[16:46] <Juerd> I don't like vague specs

[16:46] <Juerd> Or, as I prefer to call them: anti 

[16:46] <integral> what would be a bug?

[16:46] <Juerd> Or, as I prefer to call them: anti-specs

[16:46] <integral> the spec still says that it must die, rather than do something undefined

[16:46] <Juerd> Then when it dies must also be clear

[16:46] <integral> or should the spec say "this should die at compile time in batch mode, and run time in interpretive mode"?

[16:47] <Juerd> The point of determination ("when possible") is not always predictable. But at least it's defined.

[16:47] <integral> is it?

[16:47] <Juerd> Never talk to me about batch versus interactive.

[16:47] <Juerd> It's a programming language, not a shell. I find this a very weak thing in Python.

[16:48] <integral> I didn't say interactive.

[16:48] <Juerd> stdin must not be treated differently depending on such things

[16:48] <integral> I said "interpretive", maybe I should have said JIT?

[16:48] <Juerd> In that case: what is your definition of "batch mode"?

[16:48] <integral> I have no idea.  that's a big hole in my suggestion

[16:48] <integral> But what's your definition of "where possible"?

[16:49] <Juerd> *when* possible

[16:49] <integral> so that means I don't have to die if I don't feel it's possible?

[16:49] <Juerd> That's the point at which all factors in making the decision are constant.

[16:49] <Juerd> But if any of the conditions could still change, it's not possible to die yet.

[16:50] <integral> hmm

[16:50] <Juerd> As soon as the last condition turns to certainty, die immediately. This may be during optimization time, or during runtime. It could even be parse time or compile time.

[16:51] <integral> hmm, yeah.

[16:51] <Juerd> But when you know for sure that it's going to die, don't waste any bit or nanosecond 

[16:51] <Juerd> This excludes explicit dies, of course :)

[16:51] <Juerd> You wouldn't want "print 'foo'; die;" to die during compile time

[16:52] <Juerd> "Death imminent, not waiting around at - line 1" :)

[16:52] <integral> hmm, I guess that's another lint only one

[16:52] <Juerd> ?

[16:53] <integral> like dieing on finding infinite loops inside unreachable if branches

[16:53] <Juerd> unconditional death isn't a mistake

[16:53] <Juerd> afk  # food

[16:56] <integral> & food for me too

[17:00] <ingy> seen autrijus

[17:00] <jabbot> ingy: autrijus was seen 1 hours 30 minutes 24 seconds ago

[17:01] <stevan> ingy: he was giving a lightning talk a little while ago

[17:01] <stevan> he said he would be back online when he got to the hotel

[17:01] <ingy> stevan: thanks

[17:02] <stevan> ingy: your welcome :)

[17:14] <Alias_> autrijus: ping?

[17:15] <Alias_> Anyone familiar with the pugs subversion repository?

[17:19] <stevan> Alias_: what do you need to know?

[17:19] <Alias_> Do you use the whole trunk/branches/tags/etc model?

[17:19] <stevan> nope

[17:19] <Alias_> Under that situation, what is the protocol for doing branches?

[17:19] <stevan> I am not sure why though, but it was like that when i got here

[17:20] <Alias_> Or haven't they been needed

[17:20] <stevan> use svk :)

[17:20] <Alias_> So all branches are one person private branches?

[17:20] <stevan> svk makes local branches easy, then if it works, you merge it into the trunk

[17:20] <stevan> all done locally

[17:20] <stevan> yeah

[17:20] <Alias_> hmm

[17:20] <stevan> it works for Pugs,.. I am not sure it is a universally good technique though

[17:21] <Alias_> I am probably going to need multi-person branches

[17:21] <Alias_> You don't use tags either do you?

[17:21] <Alias_> tag-via-copy seems to suck extremely hard

[17:21] <stevan> I believe (and people can correct me if I am wrong) but you can serve  your svk branch from your machine if need be

[17:21] <Alias_> You should be able to, they are just svn repos

[17:22] <Alias_> with some extra metadata

[17:22] <stevan> yup

[17:22] <ingy> hi Alias_ 

[17:22] <Alias_> hiya

[17:22] <stevan> never tried it myself, but like i said, it *should* work

[17:24] <Alias_> ingy: So, has the Kwiki::Publish itch been scratched yet? :)

[17:25] <ingy> Alias_: I realized later that basically you were saying about YAML, "The way that I interpret what YAML claims to do is not possible", which is likely true ;)

[17:25] <ingy> Alias_: not yet, RSN!

[17:25] <ingy> it's a good itch

[17:25] <Alias_> ingy: Well, my complaints about YAML are two things

[17:26] <ingy> and I am planning on coming into a windfall of tuits in a few weeks

[17:26] <Alias_> One is that generalised cross-platform object serialize/deserialize isn't possible

[17:26] <Alias_> And two that you claim you can 

[17:26] <Alias_> :)

[17:27] <ingy> this is true. but yaml doesn't claim generalised cross-platform object serialization

[17:27] <ingy> you are reading way to far into a simple summary

[17:27] <Alias_> Except that it seperately claims 1) To be cross platform, and 2) To serialize/deserialize objects

[17:27] <ingy> s/to/too/

[17:27] <ingy> again...

[17:27] <Alias_> Well, it claims to be cross-platform, that much is clear

[17:27] <ingy> you are reading way too far into a simple summary

[17:27] <ingy> even that is not clear

[17:28] <ingy> it attempts to be reasonably good for reasonable language

[17:28] <Alias_> "YAML interacts well with scripting languages"

[17:28] <Alias_> plural...

[17:29] <ingy> and if two people on two platforms can agree on a schema, then YAML can be a good choice

[17:29] <Alias_> Sure, but in the mean time you allow non-schema objects very badly

[17:29] <ingy> it is always the case that there needs to be a contract of communication between to communicating entities

[17:30] <Alias_> blessing into non-existant classes for one

[17:30] <ingy> ok, so you are talking about yaml.pm and not yaml at this point

[17:31] <Alias_> I treat YAML as a non-broken implementation of YAML, yes

[17:31] <Alias_> Perhaps the reference implementation even

[17:31] *** ods15_ is now known as ods15

[17:31] <Alias_> err YAML.pm

[17:32] <Alias_> If every implementation of a parser for a language is broken, is the language broken by design?

[17:32] <ingy> good question

[17:32] <ingy> I have no answer for that

[17:32] <ingy> but I am working currently on new YAML tools for Perl

[17:33] <Alias_> Then can I make some suggestions?

[17:33] <ingy> including a YAML::Simple module

[17:33] <ingy> sure

[17:33] <ingy> but not here

[17:33] <Alias_> #channel?

[17:33] <ingy> #yaml is fine by me

[17:37] *** khisanth_ is now known as Khisanth

[18:08] <integral> Alias_: I hope you don't mind me asking, but what do you need a multi-person branch of pugs for?

[18:08] <Alias_> not pugs, openopenoffice

[18:08] <integral> ah

[18:08] <Alias_> But I hate the whole branches/tags thing, and I was curious how pugs deals with it

[18:09] <Alias_> since I'm trying to do this as much like an -Ofun project as I can

[18:11] <Alias_> wow, the US border fence doesn't go very far offshore... how many people a year try to swim around?

[18:11] <Alias_> wrong channel

[18:11] <integral> hmm, I suppose cases where we could have used a branch was for things like changing run cores around (eg. introducting PIL),  but pugs instead just has all the run cores in parallel.

[18:11] <Alias_> yeah, in my case I need to deal with client and server halves being built by totally different teams

[18:12] <Alias_> Perl for the server, C#/.NET/Office for the client

[18:12] <integral> ah, so you want the server team to have a known working client to test with while the client team break stuff

[18:12] <Alias_> So if we do an overhaul of the SOAP interface, both sides need to play

[18:12] <integral> well, another thing that's done in pugs, is if you change an interface since everything is together, you can also just change everything that uses it too

[18:13] <Alias_> yeah

[18:13] <Alias_> But since I have two very different skillsets, that's not really an option

[18:13] <Alias_> Some of these guys literally won't be able to set up the environment to edit in

[18:13] <Alias_> To hack the client you probably need WinXP, Visual Studio and Office installed

[18:14] <Alias_> And the server people are mostly linux

[18:14] <integral> hmm, sounds like you really need two duplicate trees, and then have someone who does smerges between them

[18:14] <Alias_> All I really need is a well defined SOAP interface

[18:14] <Alias_> But if that should change, I want it to change on a branch

[18:14] <Alias_> So that all parties have time to adapt before merging

[18:15] <integral> hmm, breaking everything has the advantage that things have to adapt

[18:29] <Alias_> Which is not the effect I want if a million clueless Office users are running the plugin

[18:29] <integral> that's what releases are for...

[18:29] <Alias_> My project is likely to be significantly lacking in PhDs

[18:29] <Alias_> Also, one it is widespread, I'll probably need to do release branches

[18:30] <Alias_> So we can have small security/compatibility fixes/patches while having major new versions

[18:32] <integral> sounds way more organised than pugs

[18:32] <Alias_> It needs to be, unfortunately

[21:11] <sky_> does haskell have a graph storage engine?

[21:12] <xerox> If you want there is a delimited-continuations-powered zipper-navigated referentially-transparent monadic filesystem :-)

[21:12] <Alias_> define graph

[21:12] <Alias_> math or chart

[21:12] <SamB> sky_: not built in, but I'm sure you can make one ;-)

[21:12] <sky_> Alias_: if I meant chart I would say chart :)(

[21:17] <ingy> hi sky_ 

[21:18] <Juerd> What are your greatest Perl 6 fears?

[21:18] <ingy> Is this a poll?

[21:19] <xerox> Being not able to fully understand it at a certain point.

[21:19] <integral> that people will try to do logic programming with junctions,  and store junctions in lots of variables, and pass them to other people's modules and classes.

[21:19] <ingy> that it is the final version of Perl

[21:20] * ingy looks forward to Perl 7

[21:20] <sky_> ingy: two things

[21:21] <sky_> ingy: foor boojum http://www.unfare.org/unfare/2005/10/hello_kitty_air.html

[21:21] <sky_> ingy: I AM MOVING TO THE CITY STATE OF SAN FRANCISCO

[21:21] <Juerd> ingy: Sort of.

[21:22] <Juerd> integral: Can this be shortened to: that junctions will be abused?

[21:22] <feDe__> anybody, a little help for a tiny script...?

[21:22] <integral> Juerd: yes.  I think junctions are only good for easily saying things like: if (1|2|3 == $x) { ... }.

[21:22] <feDe__> $pid = `egrep "^GEN_KEY_ID" $CONFDIR/sk_install.conf | sed -r 's/^.*=([-]?[0-9]*)/\1/'`; kill($pid);

[21:23] <ingy> sky_: fantastic and fantastic

[21:23] <feDe__> $pid should've the process id that i want to kill..

[21:23] <sky_> ingy: I am going on the hello kitty flight

[21:23] <integral> feDe__: err, that seems to be mostly egrep and sed, not perl.  Why not just write it as a shell script and use the kill program?

[21:23] <feDe__> but, it doesn't... (the shell part works perfectly! :S)

[21:24] <ingy> sky_: when?

[21:24] <feDe__> because i need it to be a perl script :S:S

[21:24] <sky_> ingy: over christmas

[21:24] <sky_> business class is like 450 USD

[21:25] <feDe__> egrep "^GEN_KEY_ID" $CONFDIR/sk_install.conf | sed -r 's/^.*=([-]?[0-9]*)/\1/'   ---------> here, in my beauty bash, it echoes the pid that i'm looking 4..

[21:25] <Juerd> sky_: Do you have any Perl 6 fears?

[21:25] <sky_> no

[21:25] <sky_> why would I

[21:26] <ingy> sky_: check msg

[21:26] <ingy> grr

[21:27] <Blicero> does pugs do threading yet?

[21:27] <Juerd> sky_: Many people do

[21:27] <ingy> sky_: are you on irc.perl.org?

[21:28] <integral> Blicero: yep

[21:28] <Juerd> typing 'svk add fears' feels funny.

[21:28] <svnbot6> r7704 | juerd++ | Assorted fears

[21:28] <integral> ?eval async { print "hello "; print "blicero" } say "goodbye"

[21:28] <evalbot_7703> Error:  unexpected "s" expecting term postfix, operator, postfix conditional, postfix loop, postfix iteration, ";" or end of input 

[21:28] <sky_> ingy: yes

[21:28] <ingy> I need to msg you but this fricking freenode needs me to do something 

[21:28] <integral> ?eval async { print "hello "; print "blicero" }; say "goodbye"

[21:28] <evalbot_7703> hello blicerogoodbye bool::true 

[21:29] <Blicero> why's it called async

[21:29] <integral> because it does things asynchronously?

[21:30] <integral> although, note that until GHC 6.5's smp support arrives, these are only simulated threads

[21:31] <SamB> they are green threads, useful for doing asynchronous processing and I/O (as long as you don't use FFI, anyway...)

[21:34] <svnbot6> r7705 | juerd++ | One more

[21:40] <svnbot6> r7706 | juerd++ | A few more

[21:44] <Juerd> evalbot_7706: You be stupid.

[21:44] <Liz> Juerd: don't insult the bots  ;-)

[21:45] <Juerd> evalbot_7706: Sorry 'bout that. Your killing is stupid.

[21:45] <Juerd> It doesn't kill itself, it seems.

[21:46] <Juerd> Does Pugs have *any* IPC yet?

[21:46] <Juerd> Of course it does. It has sockets. What am I mumbling.

[22:16] <dolmen> seen autrijus

[22:16] <jabbot> dolmen: autrijus was seen 6 hours 45 minutes 57 seconds ago

[22:17] <Liz> he said he'd be back after the lightning talk at NPW

[22:17] <Liz> guess he got sidetracked by some scandinavians...  ;-)

[22:18] <dolmen> thx Liz

[22:19] <Jooon> I didn't see him after the lighthning talks. he said he was going for a short nap and then join the rest of us later (the sidetracky beer drinking scandinavians)

[22:19] <Liz> I guess the nap got extended...

[22:20] <Liz> he looked pretty exhausted already at the Amsterdam PM Social Meeting...

[22:21] <Jooon> I still wonder where he gets his energy :) All his talks were very fun, especially the visual basic rocketh lightning talk which was like a normal talk, just much much faster :)

[22:22] <Liz> yes, that was fun... and scary...  ;-)

[22:22] <dolmen> It's past midnight in Stockholm... The nap may last for a few hours :)

[22:22] <Liz> same here...

[22:22] <dolmen> and her :)
