[00:00] <Odin-LAP> theorbtwo, eric256: Well, bugger you. I challenge you to read texts written in Old English, and be able to understand the meaning without needing a dictionary or other assistance. :)

[00:00] <theorbtwo> No, Juerd, it's not.  They're from somewhere else too.  They were just there a little longer.

[00:00] <Juerd> theorbtwo: In other parts of the world, there are actually very large groups of people who have for many generations been in the same spot on earth.

[00:00] <theorbtwo> Yes.  They came from somewhere else too, though.  They've just forgotten about it.

[00:01] <Odin-LAP> theorbtwo: Doesn't change the fact that the prior inhabitants were forcibly removed.

[00:01] <Juerd> theorbtwo: That is true.

[00:01] <Odin-LAP> (Well, apart from the ones inadvertently killed by diseases, but we can't really blame anyone for that, can we?)

[00:01] * eric256 challenges Odin-LAP to find a nation founded somewhere they didn't force *somebody* out

[00:02] <Odin-LAP> eric256: Hi. Iceland.

[00:02] <Juerd> Odin-LAP: Religious people have a great tool for that. They have dieties to blame for everything.

[00:02] <theorbtwo> Odin-LAP: The ones inadvertently killed?  No.  The ones purposefully killed: Yes, we can blame them for that, too.

[00:02] <Odin-LAP> theorbtwo: Hmh?

[00:02] <eric256> Icelands never forced ANYONE out?  i'm not prepared to rebuke that, but i doubt that it is true.  it might have happened long long ago but i'm sure it happened

[00:03] <theorbtwo> Germ theory may not have been figured out, but everybody knew that objects could carry desese, and some of those blankets sure as hell did.

[00:03] <Juerd> theorbtwo: It was thought that *spirits* and *soals* could carry disease.

[00:04] <SamB> Juerd: those people couldn't spell!

[00:04] <Juerd> theorbtwo: That blankets could was for a very long time unknown and unthought of.

[00:04] <Juerd> SamB: Neither can these. Your point?

[00:04] <SamB> hmm, that exclamation point was out of place...

[00:05] <Juerd> SamB: Your exclamation pointless point then?

[00:05] <Odin-LAP> eric256: Iceland was uninhabited, when vikings came here. There is some indication that there were christian celts here ... but the evidence is unclear whether they had left already, or left after the vikings came. There is no indication, neither historically nor archeologically, that they were forced to leave. There is no evidence whatsoever of long-term inhabitation before that.

[00:05] <SamB> hmm, lame attempt at humour?

[00:06] <Juerd> Odin-LAP: Ooh, like Mars </american> :)

[00:06] <Odin-LAP> theorbtwo: True. Those weren't the cases I was considering, though.

[00:06] <theorbtwo> Odin: I find it more likely by far that they were forced to leave and there is no longer evidence available of it then that they weren't.

[00:06] <Odin-LAP> theorbtwo: ?

[00:07] <geoffb> Returning to a (much) earlier tangent:  IIRC, the proper single word for refusing to buy into the question is "mu", from Chinese.  But I could easily be mistaken, it's been a while.

[00:07] <Juerd> theorbtwo: How is your geography?

[00:07] <theorbtwo> Not wonderful.

[00:07] <Juerd> theorbtwo: How would people *get* there?

[00:07] <Juerd> theorbtwo: It requires a certain level of sophistication

[00:07] <Odin-LAP> Oh, and did you know that norsemen in Greenland didn't see any inuits for the first hundred years or so? :>

[00:07] <Juerd> theorbtwo: And the Vikings were very probably the first... :)

[00:07] <eric256> Odin-LAP...yea some quick research seems to confirm that.  but america is definitly not the only place where that happened. i wonder if you could pick a second. unfortunatly its time to leave.  later

[00:08] <Odin-LAP> And that when the vikings came to the north american continent, they were actually driven away by the natives? :>

[00:08] <Juerd> theorbtwo: It's not a distance anyone could swim :)

[00:08] <theorbtwo> Boats?

[00:08] <Odin-LAP> eric256: I never meant to imply america was the only place.

[00:08] <Juerd> theorbtwo: Not just any boats.

[00:08] <Odin-LAP> Juerd: Oh, people did stop by earlier.

[00:08] <Juerd> Odin-LAP: But not with the means of staying there for long.

[00:09] <theorbtwo> There's pretty good evidence that nobody is native to anywhere but Africa.

[00:09] <eric256> Odin-LAP in such discussions its often implied.  anyway we are just one of the most recent and probably best documented cases. not that anyone alive today played any part in it.

[00:09] <Odin-LAP> Like I said, there's evidence to support the presence of celts, for sustained periods. Not communities, though. Apparently monestaries.

[00:09] <Odin-LAP> theorbtwo: That's a misrepresentation of the term native.

[00:09] <Odin-LAP> eric256: I'm not assigning any blame, either. :)

[00:09] * eric256 sticks aronud long enough to hear Odin-LAP representation of the word native

[00:10] * liz6 is swimming to bed

[00:10] <Juerd> liz6: Don't drown :)

[00:10] <liz6> oOOooOoOoOOoOoOooOOOoOOO  *zzzzz*

[00:10] <Juerd> liz6: Heh... This gives new meanings to "je bed induiken"

[00:10] <Odin-LAP> eric256: Well, if you're born there, grew up there, have lived most of your life there ... doesn't that mean you're native?

[00:11] <Odin-LAP> I like the australian name ... "aboriginal".

[00:11] <Odin-LAP> I don't think that has any worse negative association than does native. Although it is, as has been pointed out here, arbitrary.

[00:11] <eric256> that hardly fits "native americans" then doesn't it?  the population of americans a forced out indians was in large part native too. ;)

[00:11] <eric256> alright. later

[00:12] <Odin-LAP> Well, yes. I disagree with the terminology "native americans", but I'm in such a tiny minority that I think it's better to just shut up and conform than raise a noise.

[00:12] <Odin-LAP> It's not *that* important an issue... :>

[00:13] <Odin-LAP> (The real important issue is the continuing racism and discrimination. :)

[00:13] <theorbtwo> It's not, but it seems closely related to the earlier discussion.

[00:13] <geoffb> Odin-LAP, you're not in a tiny minority -- it's just that, most of the time, it does no one any good to argue the point.

[00:13] <Juerd> theorbtwo: For the record, please do note the "" I put around native.

[00:14] * Juerd too is in this tiny minority, regardless of whether it actually is that.

[00:14] <Odin-LAP> Heh. :p

[00:15] <Juerd> The impossible is always in some way attractive.

[00:15] <theorbtwo> I think English is such a successful language because it's so accepting of new words.  Thus, new concepts get new words quickly in English, and other languages tend to use the English terms for them, but keep them English, rather then absorbing them into their linguistic identity.

[00:15] <theorbtwo> This, at the very least, is my impression.

[00:15] <Odin-LAP> theorbtwo: That's utter bullshit.

[00:15] * Juerd refrains from saying what he thinks

[00:15] <geoffb> Odin-LAP, not holding back . . . .

[00:16] <Odin-LAP> Other languages make them theirs in just the same way as English does. That's what the whole process is about.

[00:16] <Juerd> Though this should provide you with enough information to guess the underlying thought patterns.

[00:16] <theorbtwo> Odin: What's the Icelandic term for a HTML file?

[00:16] <Odin-LAP> That's why they are loanwords, dammit! If they weren't made conform to the language, they wouldn't even be that.

[00:17] * theorbtwo finds a randm multilingual manual.

[00:17] <Odin-LAP> theorbtwo: "HTML skjal", usually. In Icelandic, you're quite likely picking the lousiest target for your point of any european language.

[00:18] <Juerd> theorbtwo: That is unfair. Your question involves a deliberately unilingual name for a technology. It was consciously named, and an acronym even.

[00:18] <Odin-LAP> We're worse than the french as regards constructing new words for most everything. :)

[00:18] <theorbtwo> What does HTML stand for in Icelandic?  Hyper-Text Markup Language, I'm betting.

[00:18] <Juerd> DUH.

[00:18] <Odin-LAP> O_o

[00:19] <theorbtwo> Why does this document say "ist für Turbo" and "ist für Reset" insted of using the German terms for Turbo and Reset?

[00:19] <Odin-LAP> theorbtwo: BIPM still stands for "Bureau International des Poids et Mesures" in English, you know.

[00:19] <Juerd> theorbtwo: They're technical jargon, which happens to be English, because you guys INVENTED it. Or, well, often claim so :)

[00:19] <theorbtwo> Yeah, we still get some of them.

[00:20] <theorbtwo> Juerd: The concept of going faster is not a purticularly new one.

[00:20] <Juerd> Technical jargon is often encouraged to not be translated.

[00:20] <Juerd> To keep it easy to exchange development and understanding.

[00:21] <Juerd> In a Dutch Perl article, I'd not translate array.

[00:21] <Juerd> Or hash.

[00:21] <Juerd> Or regex.

[00:21] <Juerd> Or sub.

[00:21] <Juerd> Or print.

[00:21] <theorbtwo> Yes.  And somehow, they generally seem to be in English.

[00:21] <Juerd> Because that'd make it very hard to ever learn Perl, considering that the official documentation is in English.

[00:22] <Odin-LAP> theorbtwo: For political reasons, not linguistic.

[00:22] <Juerd> theorbtwo: That has much to do with Larry's being of English tongue.

[00:22] <theorbtwo> I think the same is true in Ruby.

[00:22] <theorbtwo> I don't know much Ruby, I'm afraid, please correct me if I'm wrong.

[00:22] <Juerd> theorbtwo: In Ruby, it is because of political reasons only.

[00:22] <Juerd> But do note that there's a lot of japanese Ruby documentation. Even some that has no English counterpart.

[00:23] <theorbtwo> I'm surprised.

[00:23] <Odin-LAP> English is the lingua france of the modern age. Nobody is arguing otherwise. What's in dispute is the reason for that. :)

[00:23] <Juerd> Still, computer technology makes for very bad examples.

[00:23] <Odin-LAP> Oookay.

[00:23] <Odin-LAP> Muscle memory in action?

[00:23] <Odin-LAP> s/france/franca/; # BAH!

[00:24] <theorbtwo> I think computer technology is a good example; it's a place where lots of terminology gets invented all the time.

[00:24] <theorbtwo> Some of it makes it into the public conciousness, some doesn't.

[00:25] <Juerd> theorbtwo: Computers made English THE MOST DOMINANT language.

[00:25] <Juerd> Computers, and only computers, could do this. Politics can do a lot, but computers were very important.

[00:25] <Odin-LAP> theorbtwo: Computers distort the field heavily towards english.

[00:25] <Juerd> Everything that has to do with computers is in Englesh.

[00:25] <Juerd> English even

[00:25] <Odin-LAP> By virtue of politics. ;)

[00:25] <Juerd> (This is a huge generalization.)

[00:25] <Juerd> Now, consider cars.

[00:26] <Juerd> Parts have different names in different countries. Regardless of where the car came from, actually!

[00:26] <Juerd> My Korean car is described using Dutch words.

[00:26] <Juerd> And no, the original manual for the car is not English, it is Korean.

[00:27] <theorbtwo> Juerd: But I'll bet there are a number of English terms for it, in the English alphebet, even, and not transliterated.

[00:27] <Juerd> Is it a very old car, then? No, only 8 years.

[00:27] <theorbtwo> Do you have a copy of the original manual?

[00:27] <Juerd> theorbtwo: For which "it"?

[00:27] <theorbtwo> I meant "in it", the original manual.

[00:28] <Juerd> I don't have any copy. I've seen it in microprinting, though.

[00:28] <theorbtwo> Nod.

[00:28] <theorbtwo> Hm, I wonder if I have a manual handy for any nontechnical equipment with a non-latin-character-set language in the manual.

[00:28] <Juerd> I can't read Korean. There are ways to transliterate (lossily), but acronyms are usually kept roman. There were surprisingly few roman characters on the pages.

[00:29] <theorbtwo> Probably not; I don't generally keep them.

[00:29] <Juerd> Fortunately, Hyundai does translate these things too.

[00:29] <Juerd> To English, because it's the lingua franca, and thus because of politics.

[00:29] <theorbtwo> s/thus/that/, BTW.

[00:29] <Juerd> If you wish.

[00:30] <Juerd> It's not what I meant to say, though.

[00:30] <Odin-LAP> theorbtwo: Actually, no.

[00:30] <Odin-LAP> The meaning is different.

[00:30] <theorbtwo> Hm.  I know the meaning is different, but I though it was what Juerd meant to say.

[00:30] <Juerd> I've been arguing that s/// should be non-mutating by default for quite some time now. This is another good reason.

[00:31] <theorbtwo> I'm going to shut up now, though, because I told Jess I'd be up to bed soon for quite a while now.

[00:31] <theorbtwo> Er, quite a while ago now.

[00:31] <Juerd> And it's time I went home and into bed too.

[00:31] <theorbtwo> Juerd: I'd agree with making s/// non-mutating in non-void context, but mutating in void context.

[00:31] <theorbtwo> Uh, where are you?

[00:31] <Juerd> theorbtwo: That's dangerous.

[00:32] <theorbtwo> It's 1:30 in the morning there, no?

[00:32] <Juerd> Everything should be non-mutating, even in void context

[00:32] <Juerd> for @array { uc } shouldn't mutate.

[00:32] <Juerd> It's 1:30 am here, yes.

[00:32] <Juerd> I'm in my office.

[00:33] <theorbtwo> Um, OK.

[00:33] <theorbtwo> Have a nice trip, and sleep well.

[00:33] <Juerd> Would there be non-ok places for me to be? :)

[00:33] <Juerd> Just wondering...

[00:33] <Juerd> Anyway, thanks and bye

[00:33] <Juerd> Good night

[00:39] <ycheng> autrijus: will you come to icos ?

[00:39] <theorbtwo> OK, not so much.

[02:36] <dduncan> gantrixx, does it need to be in Arizona, or is telecommute fine?

[05:09] <dduncan> hmm, it seems that I've found one way that svk behaves differently than svn ... it pushes the same update more than once if I'm inside a different subdir of the remote-mirror local copy

[05:38] <eric256> hello

[05:42] <azuroth> hey

[05:44] <eric256> anyone know if p6 has a nice easy way to make linked lists? i  can't say i've used linked lists in p5 at all. but the code at http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=507605 made me wonder. that is bracket hell! ;)

[05:55] <azuroth> I wonder if eric's coming back..

[05:57] <azuroth> ?eval my $a = "5"; ~+$a

[05:57] <evalbot_7928> "5" 

[05:57] <azuroth> ?eval my $a = "5a"; ~+$a

[05:57] <evalbot_7928> "5" 

[05:57] <azuroth> cool..

[06:11] * Khisanth wonders why anyone would need to be making linked lists in Perl

[06:12] <geoffb> Khisanth, doing a lot of splicing?

[06:12] <geoffb> (In and out of really long lists, I mean)

[06:14] <Khisanth> but what are the advantages over arrays?

[06:14] <geoffb> splice() is O(1), not O(n)

[06:15] <geoffb> (Assuming you already know the splice point)

[06:15] <Khisanth> that is a strange answer

[06:15] <geoffb> Of course, finding the splice point may have become O(n) instead of O(1), so there's a tradeoff.  :-)

[06:16] <geoffb> Khisanth, why is that strange?

[06:17] <geoffb> Oh, also linked lists handle sparseness better than flat arrays

[06:17] <azuroth> sparseness?

[06:17] <azuroth> little memory?

[06:17] <dduncan> are you wanting linked lists because you think it will perform faster, or just so it is easier to use?

[06:17] <geoffb> azuroth, when only a few elements out of a large virtual array have non-empty values

[06:18] <azuroth> ahh

[06:18] <dduncan> if just the former, remember the old "don't guess but benchmark" rule

[06:18] <geoffb> dduncan, I hope you're not asking me . . . I'm only answering Khisanth's theoretical question.

[06:18] <dduncan> I'm asking whomever wants linked lists

[06:19] <geoffb> ah, well OK then.  :-)

[06:19] <dduncan> and that person left the chat room ... oops

[06:21] <Khisanth> geoffb: well in that particular post it looks like they only needed to be able to iterate through it, no need to randomly access things in the middle

[06:22] <geoffb> Having just looked at  the post, I've no clue why someone would do it that way, except because they were used to a language that didn't have arrays (or a decent idom for iterating over them)

[06:22] <azuroth> maybe eric was just wondering because that way's so ugly?

[06:23] <geoffb> azuroth, possibly

[06:23] <Khisanth> that would be odd too, I mean not even the equivalent of for( i=0; i < size; i++ ) { }? :)

[06:23] <geoffb> Khisanth, c-for is not my idea of a decent iteration idiom.  ;-)

[06:24] <Khisanth> that post doesn't look much better :P

[06:25] <geoffb> Khisanth, oh, totally agreed.

[06:27] <geoffb> perl -i.bak -pe 's/(level = ){/$1[{/; s/, next =>/},/; s/}+;$/}];/;'

[06:27] <geoffb> seems a good start

[06:32] <azuroth> that hurts my head

[06:32] <geoffb> azuroth, :-)

[06:33] <azuroth> plus I don't know what -i and -p mean. is -p like :p on regexes?

[06:35] <geoffb> -i is output directly back to the same named file you input, with an option to make a backup with a specified extension.

[06:35] <geoffb> -p means "iterate over every line in input file, printing the result of whatever changes you've made to each line"

[06:36] <azuroth> ohh. cool

[06:36] <geoffb> in other words, its a while { ....; print } loop

[06:36] <geoffb> -n is the same, without the implied print

[06:37] <azuroth> how sneaky

[06:37] <geoffb> gratuitous self-plug: http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/10/14/file_editing.html

[06:40] <azuroth> ahh, I get it now. I was getting confused with perl 6 closures slightly ;-p

[06:41] * azuroth reads

[07:27] <gaal> ooh! the parser change *did* work, but the test was wrong.

[07:28] <geoffb> :-)

[07:29] <gaal> grrr, no, actually, not exactly \-:

[07:29] * geoffb is exhausted, and the pugs build will take a while, so I'm off to bed.  Night all.

[07:29] <gaal> ?eval say "cond true" if "don't matter" ~~ { say "in cond" } 

[07:29] <evalbot_7928> in cond cond true bool::true 

[07:29] <gaal> ?eval say "cond true" if "don't matter" ~~ { say "in cond"; bool::false } 

[07:29] <evalbot_7928> in cond undef 

[07:29] <gaal> this is correct behavior

[07:30] <gaal> but the when { } { } still doesn't work

[07:30] <gaal> night geoffb 

[07:31] <azuroth> lisppaste3?

[07:31] <azuroth> hmm. I was hoping it would tell me about itself

[07:32] <buu> lisppaste3: LIVE.

[07:35] <gaal> does the order of rules matter in parsec?

[07:35] <gaal> i mean of haskell functions in the file.

[07:36] <gaal> is there a way to get a trace of the whole parse?

[07:36] <gaal> i'll ask #haskell :-)

[07:36] <azuroth> hehehe

[08:55] <clkao> dduncan: svk pushes same update more than once?

[08:56] <dduncan> hello

[08:56] <dduncan> well, something weird seems to have happened ... just a minute ...

[08:57] <dduncan> clkao, look at the Pugs commit log revs 7920 and 7926 ... the same message appears twice, but only the first one should appear

[08:58] <dduncan> quickie url is http://rt.openfoundry.org/Foundry/Project/Source/index.html/pugs/log/

[08:59] <clkao> what were you doing and where in checkout? goit command history?

[08:59] <dduncan> I have my svk set up with the single nameless repository, one subfolder to mirror remote pugs, one for local pugs

[09:00] <dduncan> I typically do all control within my pugs working dir, which is the checked out local svk subfolder

[09:00] <dduncan> to update, I say 'svk pull', which brings things all the way through like svn up did

[09:01] <dduncan> to commit, I first svk-commit, then svk-push

[09:01] <dduncan> now I did something else which may be unusual, but was what I said so far normal enough?

[09:02] <dduncan> how I often work is that ...

[09:02] <clkao> *nod*

[09:02] <dduncan> what is mirrored and checked out is all of pugs

[09:02] <dduncan> quite often my cwd is /ext/Rosetta-Incubator ...

[09:03] <dduncan> sometimes I invoke svk while the cwd is that, and other times I invoke svk when my cwd is the pugs root, which that is a subfolder of

[09:04] <dduncan> from my svn experience, I assumed that it didn't matter and the right thing would happen as long as I was in any subdir of the pugs checkout folder

[09:04] <clkao> ya, you branch the whole tree, right?

[09:04] <dduncan> yes

[09:04] <dduncan> I do it roughly like this ...

[09:05] <dduncan> svk mirror //pugs_try1/mirror http...

[09:05] <dduncan> svk cp //pugs_try1/local //pugs_try1/mirror

[09:05] <dduncan> svk sync ...

[09:05] <dduncan> svk checkout //pugs_try1/local pugs

[09:06] <dduncan> and in that checkout folder I mainly just do pull, push, and commit

[09:06] <dduncan> or I do those things in subdirs of the checkout folder

[09:06] <dduncan> I may have a few syntax errors in what I said here

[09:06] <clkao> *nod* but the flow is alright. so you usually push and pull  inside ext/rosetta?

[09:07] <dduncan> sometimes

[09:07] <clkao> and doing what on toplevel resulted in weird behaviour?

[09:07] <dduncan> I normally pull inside the pugs root folder, to get everyone's changes, and sometimes push there

[09:07] <dduncan> sometimes I push in Rosetta if thats where all my changes are

[09:07] <dduncan> I did notice ...

[09:08] <dduncan> that sometimes svk reports a whole bunch of auto-merges going on, or names files with the 'g' flag on the left column, when I push or pull, when I wouldn't expect that to happen

[09:08] <dduncan> said merges were between my local and mirror, on files that either I and no one else edited, or other people and not I

[09:09] <dduncan> the 'g' I think appeared just naming the files in the commit that appeared on pugs main server twice

[09:09] <dduncan> this seemed unusual, so I thought perhaps my cwd at the time of the push/pull may have been a factor ...

[09:10] <dduncan> unless there's a better solution, I'm thinking to just explicitly cwd to the pugs root checkout before doing any push/pull so that doesn't happen

[09:11] <clkao> 'g' during push or pull? or both?

[09:12] <dduncan> I'm having trouble remembering, but I think it was either once on both or once on the pull

[09:12] <dduncan> I think it occurred when I pushed when inside the ext subdir, and later pulled when in the main dir

[09:12] <clkao> ok, i will take a look at pugs repository later

[09:13] <clkao> there should be trace

[09:13] <dduncan> on a separate note ...

[09:13] <dduncan> do you remember my saying a few days ago that svk spat out warnings from Class::Autouse on every invocation?

[09:14] <clkao> ya. it seems to have something to do with c::autouse version and svn version iirc.

[09:14] <dduncan> I tracked this down to apparently being a bug in perl 5.8.1, which no longer exists in version 5.8.7

[09:14] <clkao> really?

[09:14] <clkao> but i thought people still see that on macosx perl 587

[09:14] <dduncan> the warning is ...

[09:14] <dduncan> Useless use of a constant in void context at /usr/local/svk-1.05/perl/Class/Autouse.pm line 79 ... and other lines

[09:15] <dduncan> but looking at that source file showed that the constant's use was not a void context

[09:15] <dduncan> in my interpretation ...

[09:16] <dduncan> for example, line 79 says : _debug(\@_, 1) if DEBUG

[09:17] <dduncan> that doesn't look like a void context, since the constant DEBUG is being used in an if-statement

[09:18] <dduncan> as a test, I tried getting the same Autouse from CPAN and making it by itself ... doing this under the system perl 5.8.1 spat out the same warnings, though fewer of them ... making it under my custom perl 5.8.7 did not display any warnings

[09:18] <dduncan> this was my first determination that it was a bug in perl

[09:19] <dduncan> also, yesterday I looked at the perldeltas for the 5.8 series, and around 5.8.5 it said it removed some warnings which seemed relevant

[09:20] <dduncan> so now, I tried to make use of this fact, and tried customizing the svkbuild config file to use my custom perl rather than the normal one, but some of the bundled perl modules threw a fit, I think due to /usr/bin/perl being hardcoded in some places, so I had no choice but to install svk against the system perl and put up with the warnings

[09:21] <dduncan> clkao, so that's my report re svk for today

[09:25] <r0nny> yo

[09:25] <dduncan> yo jo

[10:23] <azuroth> haha. yeah, I'll give that a go

[10:23] <buu> Good!

[16:51] <xinming> ?eval role A { method test { "$?CLASS" } }; class B does A { }; B.new.test;

[16:51] <evalbot_7930> "A" 

[16:51] <xinming> Is this right?

[16:54] <xinming> ?eval role A { method test { ::?CLASS } }; class B does A { }; B.new.test;

[16:54] <evalbot_7930> \::A 

[16:56] <gaal> $?CLASS is compiletime, no? so i think it is right.

[16:58] <xinming> gaal: hmm, I don't agree with that. :-/

[17:00] <xinming> gaal: if so, which variable will be used for current class name?

[17:03] <gaal> $*CLASS maybe? I'm not sure about OOP in p6 at all; this is by analogy with other things.

[17:05] <Juerd> $?CLASS

[17:05] <xinming> Juerd: So, This might be a bug.

[17:06] <Juerd> Why?

[17:07] <xinming> Juerd: As, role A is used for code reuse, and class is used for instance management, But here, what the example above shown is that $?CLASS should be the same as "B". :-/

[17:07] <xinming> hmm,

[17:07] * xinming isn't so sure about this...

[17:08] <Juerd> I think you're right.

[17:09] * Juerd is labeling 3.5" diskettes again.

[17:09] <Juerd> It feels like I went 10 years back in time.

[17:10] * Juerd remembers the first time he did some work for a company.

[17:10] <Juerd> They couldn't pay me in cash, but I was very, very happy with the 10 boxes of diskettes.

[17:11] <Juerd> I had a few hundred in use.

[17:11] <xinming> I still remember what I did for my first job is posting new articles. :-P

[17:11] <Juerd> I was 13, and couldn't really afford all the disks I needed to store everything I wanted to store.

[17:12] <Juerd> It was hard to throw the diskettes away after they had been magnetized by a misplaced magnet.

[17:12] <Juerd> Sure, I hadn't used any of the disks in over a year, but it was painful anyhow :)

[17:13] <Juerd> Now, many years later again, I actually had to buy a box... To install Windows Server 2003.

[17:13] <Juerd> The morons still want their SCSI drivers on old fashioned magdisks.

[17:16] <liz6> you mean the tinkering charlatans?

[17:16] <Juerd> Other prutsers, but yes :)

[17:16] <kolibrie> xinming: $?CLASS is set at compile time, but is lexically scoped, so I think you are right - should be B

[17:17] <xinming> Juerd: hmm, for installing, Windows, You'd better to buy a Floppy Drive. though, you can make an iso yourself with the needed Controller driver built in, But it is really a pain while you try this,

[17:17] * xinming ever wasted 5 CD-Rs,

[17:17] <Juerd> I know, I know...

[17:17] <Juerd> It's exactly why I still put old fashioned disk drives in Windows boxes.

[17:17] <xinming> That's why I have to choose Linux for my Sata 200G disk. :-/

[17:18] <Juerd> Haha

[17:18] <xinming> Ext3 isn't so stable in some situation.

[17:18] <Juerd> I think Microsoft has some evil contracts with fdd manufacturers.

[17:18] <Juerd> This is the only reason they still produce these things :)

[17:19] <Juerd> Then don't pick ext3.

[17:19] <Juerd> You have a dozen filesystems to choose a good one from.

[17:19] <Juerd> If ext3 doesn't fit your need, choose another.

[17:19] * kolibrie thought he had a working 5 1/4" floppy drive, but seems to spin forever now, instead of reading the disk

[17:19] <Juerd> I still have 5.25" floppies in a shrink wrapped box.

[17:19] * liz6 remembers that as a feature of FastBack

[17:19] <Juerd> No drive for them, though :)

[17:20] <xinming> Juerd: HDD installation for Xp is also a big pain, I ever met one don't know to run smartdrv before installation, the copy progress takes over 2 hours.

[17:20] <Juerd> I have noticed by the way that diskettes nowadays are always preformatted. :(

[17:21] <Juerd> smartdrv?

[17:21] <Juerd> Huh?

[17:21] <Juerd> That kind of stuff is done automagically nowadays, isn't it?

[17:21] <Juerd> I install XP once every few weeks. Always takes less than 45 minutes.

[17:21] <xinming> Juerd: hmm, not too bad in my opinion, they use dm to partition the disk, and dm won't check for sectors.

[17:21] <Juerd> (Then finding and installing all drivers and software, and then configuring it, is what takes the rest of the day...)

[17:22] <xinming> Juerd: hmm, Try hard disk installation, go into DOS, and run winnt :-)

[17:22] <kolibrie> (debian)++

[17:22] <Juerd> debian++

[17:22] <Juerd> ubuntu++ too

[17:22] <xinming> (debian)+++++++++

[17:22] <Juerd> I'm using kubuntu 5.10 on my laptop

[17:23] <Juerd> It's the nicest desktop distro I've experienced so far.

[17:23] <xinming> For reinstallation of Debian, It will only take less than 3 hours after the whole thing configured.

[17:23] <xinming> Juerd: hmm, I prefer pure Debian, :-P

[17:23] <Juerd> 3 hours?

[17:23] <Juerd> xinming: For non-workstations, so do I.

[17:23] <xinming> Juerd: hmm, need to download. :-)

[17:23] <Juerd> Workstations should work, not be pure. Otherwise they'd be purestations :)

[17:24] <Juerd> xinming: By the way. Pure debian: juerd.nl/debianraid

[17:25] <Juerd> It's pure if you use debootstrap :)

[17:25] <Juerd> I don't want a menu driven installer :)

[17:25] <xinming> And now every time I use Windows 98, And I still feeling odd for that I can afford the blue screen...

[17:25] <Juerd> (Takes too long)

[17:27] <xinming> Juerd: I make a system tar.ball after I installed debian, So, I just need to go into another small Linux tar xf into the spcified partition, :-)

[17:28] <xinming> Why I prefer Linux is because I can use console to come here, and access the Internet while the system is downloading stuff.

[17:29] <xinming> hmm, I think I should say debian. :-) install red hat 7.3 is also a pain compared with debian.

[17:31] <xinming> ?eval class A is B { method f {1} }; class B { method g { ./f } }; A.g;

[17:31] <xinming> what does ./f mean here?

[17:31] <xinming> hmm, a bit confused about the '/'

[17:32] <kolibrie> xinming: ./f was a one-time syntax for $?SELF.f, or something like that

[17:32] <kolibrie> died in p6l after a bitter war

[17:33] <xinming> but still alive in pugs.

[17:33] <kolibrie> :)

[17:36] <svnbot6> r7931 | yiyihu++ | role A { method test { "$?CLASS" }}; class B does A { }; B.new.test should return the "CURRENT" Class name,

[17:36] <svnbot6> r7931 | yiyihu++ | add the test.

[17:37] <Juerd> xinming: In short: ./method is short for self.method

[17:37] <Juerd> self is probably not yet implemented in pugs, but I'm not sure.

[17:38] <Juerd> xinming: Re the tarball: that'll give you an out of date base system in a few years, and that has tiny but important disadvantages

[18:21] <Juerd> xinming: Really? Thanks :)

[18:21] <Juerd> kolibrie: /hilight

[18:37] <kolibrie> Juerd: can it give me some visual cue if I'm on a different screen (or how can I set up /hilight -> bell -> visual bell), maybe it's a screen question

[18:49] <Juerd> kolibrie: Set the actcolor

[18:50] <Juerd> kolibrie: That changes the colour of the window number in the [Act: ] part of the status bar.

[18:50] <Juerd> kolibrie: Or do you mean screen(1) windows? 

[18:51] <Juerd> kolibrie: If so, write a Perl script to match incoming lines and echo a \a

[18:51] <kolibrie> Juerd: actcolor looks very nice, didn't know about that

[18:52] <kolibrie> Juerd: and yes, I always run under screen(1)

[18:52] <Juerd> What do you mean by "a different screen"?

[18:52] <Juerd> I'm sure you mean window, not screen, but which window? Screen's window, or irssi's window?

[18:52] <kolibrie> screen's window

[18:53] <Juerd> Then you will need a real bell

[18:53] <Juerd> Which irssi doesn't do

[18:54] <kolibrie> so, I'd need something that echos an \a if a hilight matched, which would sound the bell, which screen would capture and turn into a visual bell?

[20:19] <Juerd> kolibrie: Well, it doesn't have to be a visual bell

[20:20] <Juerd> kolibrie: Screen warns in the form of "21:08 < Gerrit> hoi Anakinzero

[20:21] <kolibrie> Juerd: I see those sometimes, but miss them often

[20:21] <Juerd> It keeps them visible for only a short while.

[20:21] <Juerd> I don't know if that's configurable

[20:22] <kolibrie> right now, I just have to check my irssi window from time-to-time, if I remember.  I'd just like something that can get my attention, if I want to give it

[20:23] <Juerd> I use a separate terminal for irssi :)

[20:23] <Juerd> So I don't have that problem

[20:23] <Juerd> I use screen anyway, but this screen primarily for irsi.

[20:24] <kolibrie> then you just poke that terminal out at the bottom, so you can see the [Act ] bar?

[20:25] <Juerd> No, my terminals are all in the same Konsole window

[20:25] <Juerd> It has a tab bar.

[20:25] <kolibrie> does it show other tab activity somehow?

[20:25] <Juerd> I shift between terminals a lot (shift-cursorleft and shift-cursorright), so I automatically see the irssi window from time to time.

[20:25] <Juerd> It can, but I don't use that feature

[20:26] <Juerd> Computers get too annoying when they constantly grab your attention.

[20:26] <kolibrie> that is true

[20:41] <wolverian> hooray, my new thinkpad!

[20:50] <Corion> I blamed GHC 6.2 in http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=507854 for the compilation errors. Is that correct?

[21:47] <eric256> i have no idea why its getting six. lol

[21:48] <masak> maybe it numifies the string representation of the junction :)

[21:48] <theorbtw1> It's the first element.

[21:49] <masak> yes, but why?

[21:53] <Juerd> 22:46 < wolverian> I think he just picks the first element in the junction

[21:53] <Juerd> wolverian: Conceptually, there is no first element.

[21:54] <wolverian> yeah.

[21:55] <Juerd> ?eval (1&2)|(3&4)

[21:55] <evalbot_7932> 1 

[21:55] <Juerd> ?eval (99&2)|(3&4)

[21:55] <evalbot_7932> 2 

[21:56] <Juerd> ?eval (99&3)|(3&4)

[21:56] <evalbot_7932> 3 

[21:56] <Juerd> ?eval (99&4)|(3&4)

[21:56] <evalbot_7932> 3 

[21:56] <Juerd> It picks the least element.

[21:56] <masak> weird

[21:56] <Juerd> Testing things using sequential numbers isn't really a good idea.

[22:02] <wolverian> Juerd, do you know if the ibm active protection functions in linux?

[22:12] *** Gruber is now known as Grrrr

[22:32] <Juerd> wolverian: Since 2.6.14; I haven't tried it yet.

[23:51] <cognominal_> Juerd, I have a folder with almost 100 papers named in the format:   "year -- authors -- paper title" like 2 1992 -- Phikip Wadler -- The essence of functional programming.ps

[23:52] <cognominal_> are you interested do get them in a public place in feather?

[23:53] <cognominal_> they are about compilation, function programming, type theory. subject that will probably matters to perl6 people
