[01:37] <autrijus> greetings lambdacamels.

[01:37] <obra> autrijus, have you had tori do a logo of the camel with its legs in a lambda yet?

[01:38] <autrijus> no, not yet

[01:38] <autrijus> amahabal++# figuring out the parsing bug

[01:39] * autrijus tries mapping amahabal to an id here

[01:41] * abstraction still doesn't like _

[01:41] <Steve_p> evening autrijus

[01:42] <autrijus> hi testeve.

[01:43] * autrijus blames the still very high latency

[01:43] <autrijus> I wonder how good it will be to directly connect to freenode here

[01:44] <tea> Hello :) im playing with pugs, now

[01:45] * tea interested in the logical and fp style programing.

[01:46] <Steve_p> Hi tea.  There's quite a few fp style programmers here :)

[01:48] <tea> I got an implession at the y-combinator sample :)

[01:50] <tea> it was hard to understand for me before. until today I saw the sample in perl6.

[01:51] <autrijus> &?SUB you mean?

[01:51] <autrijus> I wonder where is such a sample :)

[01:52] <autrijus> tea: you grok ruby? many discussions here can benefit from rubyfolks' input

[01:52] <tea> autrijus: Yeah, that.

[01:53] <tea> autrijus: what is grok ?

[01:53] <tea> I'm new in this channel :)

[01:53] <autrijus> # http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/G/grok.html

[01:53] <autrijus> basically " understand"

[01:54] <autrijus_> latency test. 1.2.3...

[01:54] <mugwump> you really need to read the book to grok grok :)

[01:54] <autrijus_> ok, works. switching to chatzilla for now

[01:54] *** autrijus is now known as autrijus[tw]

[01:54] *** autrijus_ is now known as autrijus

[01:55] <autrijus> fixing () parsing now

[01:55] <autrijus> once that's done I'll just roll 6.0.9 during this all-tests-pass window :)

[01:57] <tea> ah thx, i read the page, but seem "grok" is a word hard to understand for me

[01:57] <mugwump> where are you living, tea?

[01:58] <tea> mugwump: japan, and I'm non-native english speaker

[01:58] <obra> is svn.perl.org up to date, autrijus?

[01:58] <autrijus> obra: sure is

[01:58] <autrijus> synced every night

[01:58] <obra> ok. a couple hours svn.perl.org was failing tests for me. let me test

[01:59] <obra> oh. I was 10 commits out of date

[02:02] <obra> still failing a bunch of tests

[02:02] <obra> what's the right way to hand off failures?

[02:04] <obra> Failed 10/40 test scripts, 75.00% okay. 55/426 subtests failed, 87.09% okay.

[02:04] <mugwump> todo_ok() ?

[02:05] <obra> that's just make test

[02:05] <autrijus> obra: syncup again

[02:08] <autrijus> obra: you really want to track openfoundry tough, if you're into realtime testing

[02:09] <autrijus> until I set up auto magic syncups

[02:09] <obra> nod. 

[02:10] <autrijus> the debian leader is speaking.

[02:11] <autrijus> saying QA has to start at the beginning and can't be tackled on later -- now he starts talking about cat-herding techniques

[02:11] <autrijus> 1000 cats and 10000 packages, that is

[02:11] <obra> t/operator "unexpected operator 'o'  was expecting ";"

[02:12] <autrijus> yup. that's the thing I'm fixing.

[02:12] <autrijus> anything else?

[02:12] <obra> that's it

[02:12] <autrijus> ok then. :)

[02:12] <obra> ubuntu hoary

[02:12] <stevan> autrijus: I just updated t/op/hash.t

[02:12] <autrijus> okie

[02:13] <stevan> all tests are still passing though :)

[02:13] <buu> autrijus: Anyidea why 'nmake' is giving me an "Fatal error: spawn failed : invalid argument" on win32?

[02:13] <autrijus> buu: activeperl + ghc msi?

[02:13] <obra> I'm watching Apocalypse Now

[02:14] <buu> autrijus: Right

[02:15] <buu> The perl Makefile.PL goes off without a hitch

[02:16] <autrijus> buu: "nmake pugs.exe"

[02:16] <autrijus> also see if typing "ghc --version" works

[02:17] <buu> "ghc --make -o pugs src/Main.hs -isrc"

[02:17] <buu> "NMAKE: fatal error U1045: spawn failed : invalid argument"

[02:17] <buu> Stop.

[02:17] <buu> ghc --version

[02:17] <buu> The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 6.2.2

[02:18] <autrijus> how about you typing that line by hand?

[02:18] <autrijus> ghc --make -o pugs src/Main.hs -isrc

[02:19] <buu> Chasing modules...

[02:19] <buu> Compiling..

[02:20] <buu> Linking...

[02:20] <buu> No error.

[02:20] <autrijus> I suspect your nmake.exe is somehow weird.

[02:20] <buu> Reasonable

[02:20] <autrijus> did my Makefile.PL install it for you?

[02:20] <Steve_p> somewhat? ;)

[02:20] <buu> autrijus: Nope

[02:21] <buu> autrijus: I didn't see any mention of nmake in the makefile.

[02:21] <autrijus> try kill it from path

[02:21] <autrijus> run makefile.pl again

[02:21] <autrijus> which should download a good nmake.exe for you

[02:21] <buu> Where would makefile.pl put it?

[02:21] <autrijus> same path as your perl.exe

[02:21] <buu> Er, in the same folder as perl.exe?

[02:21] <autrijus> yup.

[02:21] <Steve_p> I usually do 

[02:21] <autrijus> you can always move it away later

[02:21] <buu> Nope, not there

[02:21] <autrijus> yeah, you need to remove the nmake.exe from PATH first

[02:22] <autrijus> delete it or something

[02:22] <ingy> autrijus: hi

[02:22] <autrijus> the url to the installer is http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/Nmake15.exe

[02:22] <autrijus> hey ingy. nice to see kwid coming along that nicely!

[02:23] <buu> autrijus: Yeah, that's the one I god

[02:23] <buu> got*

[02:23] <autrijus> not sure what to do then. hmm.

[02:23] <autrijus> (it worksforme)

[02:23] <buu> Hrm

[02:24] <buu> I have nmake in my path someplace

[02:24] <buu> But it's not in \perl\bin

[02:25] <ingy> autrijus: how would you suggest I write a Kwid parser/formatter?

[02:25] <ingy> would it be best to do a perl5 one for now?

[02:25] <buu> Ah..

[02:25] <autrijus> ingy: if you have time to learn parsec

[02:26] <autrijus> do it in parsec :)

[02:26] <ingy> ok

[02:26] <autrijus> it will take just a few hours at most

[02:26] <ingy> I think parsec would make it easy

[02:26] <autrijus> sure will.

[02:26] <ingy> and I needd to learn it for the yaml parser anyway

[02:26] <autrijus> parsec is a preview of the power of p6rules :)

[02:26] <ingy> :)

[02:27] <ingy> autrijus: is parsec covered in yaht?

[02:27] <buu> autrijus: hrm

[02:27] <buu> autrijus: I removed nmake from my path, reran makefile.pl, it got nmake, I ran nmake, same error.

[02:27] <autrijus> ingy: no, read the parsec manual :)

[02:27] <autrijus> buu: 'fraid it's beyond me then :-/

[02:27] <ingy> ok

[02:28] <buu> Gah

[02:28] <ingy> did you get my comment that '=kwid' is not Kwid?

[02:28] <autrijus> if you'd have tuits to convert our build system to Build.PL

[02:28] <autrijus> ingy: yup. sorry for that

[02:28] <autrijus> buu: Build.PL would work

[02:28] <buu> tuits?

[02:28] <ingy> no worries

[02:28] <autrijus> tuits, as in cycles

[02:28] <autrijus> as in available time

[02:28] <buu> I see.

[02:28] <buu> Is tuits an actual word?

[02:29] <ingy> when I get a round tuit

[02:29] <buu> Ah.

[02:29] * ingy hands buu a round tuit

[02:29] <ingy> there you go

[02:29] * buu rolls it down the hall with a stick

[02:30] <buu> Hrm. How might I run the tests now?

[02:31] <buu> And are the tests supposed to pass?

[02:33] <stevan> buu: all the tests currently either pass or are labeled TODO

[02:33] <buu> oh

[02:33] <stevan> buu: and one is skipped

[02:33] <buu> "Failed (TODO) test" =]

[02:33] <autrijus> you can run the tests by hand using

[02:33] <autrijus> set HARNESS_PERL=pugs

[02:34] <stevan> actually I have been able to use 'prove' without any trouble

[02:34] <buu> Oh hey, I have prove.

[02:34] <autrijus> prove t\*

[02:34] <stevan> of course its in the same login session I did make-test (which may help)

[02:34] <autrijus> that'd do.

[02:34] <autrijus> remember to set harness_perl

[02:34] <autrijus> otherwise it will try to run p6 code wit p5

[02:34] <autrijus> which won't be very much fun

[02:34] <buu> Yeah

[02:35] <buu> t\03operator...NOK 15#  Failed Test (t\03operator.t at line 42, column 1)

[02:35] <buu> That's not supposed to happen?

[02:35] <stevan> buu: sometimes things break :)

[02:35] <buu> stevan: Just checking

[02:36] <stevan> buu: your welcome to try and figure out the bug :)

[02:36] <buu> Hrm

[02:36] <buu> t\op\recurse timed out

[02:36] <stevan> buu: yeah thats normal

[02:37] <buu> Failed 10/40 test scripts, 75% okay. 60/452 subtests failed, 86.73% okay.

[02:37] <stevan> buu: the t/03operator issue is with chained comparisons

[02:37] <autrijus> hmm, you're using openfoundry head?

[02:37] <stevan> AFAIK that is not implemented

[02:37] <autrijus> I'm fixing 03operator. it's almost there.

[02:37] <autrijus> no, it is now :)

[02:37] <autrijus> luqui broke it

[02:37] <autrijus> sorry, bad keybinding

[02:37] <buu> autrijus: Maybe. I can update again

[02:39] <stevan> autrijus: there are other tests for chained comparisons in t/op/relational.t

[02:39] <stevan> maybe i should make a t/op/chained_comparisons.t

[02:39] <stevan> put them all in the same place

[02:39] <autrijus> actually I'd argue relational is the place to test chained cmps

[02:39] <ingy> dinner is ready

[02:39] <autrijus> since they're just standard feature in p6

[02:40] <autrijus> but I don't feel that strongly on it, so do what you seem best :)

[02:40] <stevan> autrijus: okay, I will move the 03operator.t ones into there then

[02:40] <autrijus> k

[02:40] <ingy> autrijus: got your book

[02:40] <autrijus> ingy woot

[02:40] <autrijus> is HOP out yet?

[02:40] <ingy> don't think so

[02:40] <ingy> gotta eat. bbiab

[02:43] <autrijus> see ya.

[02:44] <autrijus> I have traced down the chained cmp bug and the parens bug

[02:44] <autrijus> doing a final regression test

[02:44] <stevan> autrijus: let me know when you commit,.. I will move the tests around after that

[02:45] <buu> Sounds exciting

[02:48] <autrijus> "the model of ubuntu's QA is the way to go, I think personally, but debian has a history of saying all packages are equal, and it will be a large flamewar if we change that tradition... sigh"

[02:48] <autrijus> hi SyntaxNinja!

[02:48] <SyntaxNinja> hi autrijus

[02:49] <SyntaxNinja> I was thinking of hacking a little bit on pugs :)

[02:50] <autrijus> woot!

[02:50] <autrijus> you came in at a correct time :)

[02:50] <autrijus> (well, any time is, really, but we just got all tests passed)

[02:50] <SyntaxNinja> is all the stuff under Rules developed by daan? I see some funny code in there, but maybe it's beyond me

[02:50] <SyntaxNinja> I just darcs pulled, and it looks good ;)

[02:50] <buu> Pssh

[02:50] <autrijus> it's currently all parsec code

[02:50] <buu> Tests are failing

[02:51] <autrijus> it will work for you once I commit :)

[02:51] <autrijus> (14 subtests UNEXPECTEDLY SUCCEEDED), 2 subtests skipped.

[02:51] <buu> heh

[02:51] * buu waits with baited breath

[02:51] <autrijus> good. I fixed 14 subtests in a run.

[02:51] <stevan> autrijus: I will un-TODO those tests once you commit 

[02:51] <autrijus> cool.

[02:52] <crysflame> nice!

[02:56] <autrijus> committing.

[02:57] <stevan> updating

[02:57] <autrijus> nope. it will take a long time :)

[02:57] <autrijus> the network == horribly slow

[02:58] <autrijus> this is suppsoed to be broadband :-/

[02:58] <stevan> autrijus: yeah I figured that :)

[02:58] <autrijus> done, r332

[02:58] <autrijus> please unTODO the 25 subtests

[02:58] <autrijus> All tests successful (25 subtests UNEXPECTEDLY SUCCEEDED)

[02:58] <stevan> cool

[02:58] <stevan> will do

[02:59] <autrijus> stevan++

[02:59] * autrijus focuses on other releng stuff now

[02:59] <obra> is the project actually still accelerating?

[02:59] <autrijus> I think so, yeah.

[03:00] <autrijus> I'm not accelerating, but the project seems to be

[03:00] <buu> Gah

[03:00] <buu> What is wrong with my bloody nmake

[03:01] <autrijus> buu: do you have problem nmaking other cpan modules?

[03:01] <abstraction> windows?

[03:01] <buu> autrijus: I haven't tried =/

[03:01] <buu> I was using cygwin

[03:01] <autrijus> try it with $random_cpan_distro and see

[03:01] <autrijus> hmm. try removing cygwin from your path

[03:01] <autrijus> PATH even

[03:01] <buu> It's not in the path

[03:02] <autrijus> weird.

[03:02] <autrijus> win2k?

[03:02] <buu> At least, my windows path

[03:02] <buu> Yep

[03:02] <abstraction> what's mandel.p6 ?

[03:02] <buu> Apparently nmake can't spawn any process

[03:02] <autrijus> abstraction: it is something that, if you update to HEAD, works again

[03:02] <autrijus> and can draw a nice mandelbrot set on your screen

[03:03] <abstraction> it just draws dots

[03:03] <abstraction> wait

[03:03] <buu> Yay!

[03:03] <autrijus> abstraction: are you tracing svn.openfoundry head?

[03:03] <buu> All tests sucessful, 25 subtests unexpectedly suceeded)

[03:03] <autrijus> woot.

[03:03] <autrijus> buu++

[03:04] <buu> Heh, I didn't do anything

[03:04] <stevan> buu: its magic

[03:04] <autrijus> I think it's you who prompted me to add cygwin check into Makefile.PL

[03:04] <buu> What's the check do?

[03:05] <autrijus> it tells you to use MinGW perl or ActivePerl and dies spectacularly.

[03:05] <buu> Awesome.

[03:05] <buu> autrijus++ #advancing the cause of perl6

[03:05] <autrijus> :)

[03:05] <buu> Just wait till I compile cygwin ghc.

[03:05] <autrijus> I think they ran into dome ld bugs

[03:05] <SyntaxNinja> would work toward -Wall cleanness be welcome?

[03:06] <autrijus> SyntaxNinja: yes! yes definitely

[03:06] <autrijus> <- haskell newbie

[03:06] <autrijus> well, 2 months, but still newbie

[03:06] <SyntaxNinja> these changes tend to be annoying for conflicts, so I'll send them in small bundles

[03:06] <autrijus> sure thing.

[03:06] <buu> autrijus: With out getting in to a silly argument, I know you said you're using haskell because it has some cool features, but if you have haskell, why bother to write perl6?

[03:06] <autrijus> SyntaxNinja++

[03:07] <autrijus> buu: haskell is good for writing perl6.

[03:07] <autrijus> perl6 is good for writing a good deal many other things.

[03:07] <mugwump> "horses for courses"

[03:07] <buu> Ah

[03:07] <buu> Reasonable

[03:07] <abstraction> autrijus, yeah, at revision 332

[03:07] <SyntaxNinja> heh

[03:07] <autrijus> haskell may get good at those many other things with Cabal (i.e. haskell's CPAN) populated

[03:07] <autrijus> which I also intend to help

[03:07] <autrijus> but it's not there yet, really :)

[03:07] <abstraction> it's working now

[03:08] <autrijus> abstraction: nice

[03:08] <SyntaxNinja> I'm sure it would be a disappointing outcome if the perl6 hackers realized that haskell was too fun to give up ;)

[03:08] * SyntaxNinja high-fives autrijus for mentioning cabal

[03:08] <buu> haha

[03:08] <autrijus> SyntaxNinja: monolingual is no fun :)

[03:08] <buu> SyntaxNinja: It'd be pretty amusing.

[03:08] <autrijus> btw, SyntaxNinja is haskell world's andreas koenig. :)

[03:09] <buu> I have no idea who andreas koenig is =[

[03:09] <autrijus> buu: he did PAUSE and MakeMaker and other stuff.

[03:10] <buu> Cool.

[03:10] <SyntaxNinja> :)

[03:10] <buu> Haskell isn't one of those bizarre parentheses infested lispy things is it?

[03:10] <autrijus> nope. there is very little parens in haskell.

[03:10] <buu> Hurray!

[03:11] <autrijus> when you see too many parens, you place a dollar sign

[03:11] <SyntaxNinja> buu: but you can put parens all ove rthe place if you want to make pretend that haskell is lame

[03:11] <autrijus> which makes it looks like perl, but really is not :)

[03:11] <buu> SyntaxNinja: =]

[03:12] <buu> Woah. makemaker.org

[03:13] <autrijus> yeah, it's schwern's baby now

[03:13] <autrijus> we sacrifice a perl5 porter each year to the MakeMaker god so it won't get angry and bitrot

[03:13] <autrijus> and schwern is currently the sacrifice

[03:14] <buu> Ahh

[03:14] <buu> Sounds like a great party

[03:14] <mugwump> so just where did that "do ->" syntax in S09 come from, anyway?

[03:14] <autrijus> mugwump: when you see ->, read "sub"

[03:14] <autrijus> anonymous closure

[03:15] <autrijus> so it's just do &sub

[03:15] <autrijus> with a fancy syntax

[03:15] <buu> Horrifying.

[03:15] <autrijus> foreach @list -> $x { ... }

[03:16] <buu> Er, so what is that supposed to do?

[03:16] <autrijus> it's the same as perl5:

[03:17] <autrijus> foreach my $x (@list) { ... }

[03:17] <autrijus> but with a saner syntax and less parens.

[03:17] <buu> Oh. That's what I thought, your "when you see ->, read 'sub'" was confusing me

[03:17] <autrijus> it means

[03:17] <mugwump> ah, you haven't joined closures and subs yet, buu

[03:17] <autrijus> &foreach(@list, sub ($x) { ... });

[03:18] <buu> !

[03:18] <mugwump> Read synopsis 4

[03:18] <buu> Why did you have to tell me that, it was making sense.

[03:18] <autrijus> ha.

[03:18] <autrijus> read S04 :)

[03:18] <buu> Can you remind me where they are?

[03:18] <buu> dev.perl.org?

[03:18] <mugwump> t/Synopsis :)

[03:19] <autrijus> sure, they are in http://dev.perl.org/perl6/synopsis/

[03:19] <buu> Ah. Thanks.

[03:19] <autrijus> that too, if your brain can parse pod

[03:19] <autrijus> s/brain/toolset/

[03:19] <buu> I shall check them out and write some bizarre perl6 code to break pugs.

[03:19] <autrijus> buu++ # yay, welcome aboard

[03:19] <SyntaxNinja> darcs send isn't working for me :(

[03:19] <autrijus> :-/

[03:19] <autrijus> assuming it's not my bug

[03:20] <SyntaxNinja> probably not. it's locking hard

[03:20] <buu> I blame darcs, because it's written in some funny no good language.

[03:20] <autrijus> har har.

[03:20] <autrijus> indeed, the same no good language that writes perl6 :)

[03:20] <buu> Pssh

[03:20] <SyntaxNinja> in lexer.hs around line 422, how come you're not checking for the other types of operator associativity?

[03:20] <buu> I'm not listening to your lies and heresy!

[03:20] *** metaperl_ is now known as metaperl

[03:21] <autrijus> SyntaxNinja: I added two assocs and I had not started dealing with them

[03:21] <autrijus> so it's only using builtin parsec assocs for now

[03:21] <autrijus> the two new assocs are currently dealt with with tree rewriting

[03:22] <autrijus> but they really want to be dealt at the parser level I think. 

[03:22] <SyntaxNinja> oh, the reason darcs send isn't working, I guess, is because the repo is timing out

[03:22] <autrijus> stevan: how's detodo doing? I think I'm only blocking on that

[03:23] <autrijus> yeah, confirmed, the darcs repo machine is offline for some reason

[03:23] <stevan> autrijus: I am almost done

[03:23] <autrijus> SyntaxNinja: you can just drop them to autrijus at autrijus dot org

[03:23] <autrijus> stevan: yay :)

[03:23] <stevan> autrijus: running prove t/* now to make sure

[03:23] <autrijus> The changelog is more than one screen long. :-/

[03:24] <autrijus> actually, almost more than two screens

[03:24] * autrijus tries some consolidating

[03:25] <stevan> autrijus: the recurse.t still skips though

[03:25] <stevan> should we change that?

[03:25] <autrijus> stevan: is it fast enough now?

[03:25] <autrijus> I don't mind skipping it if it's still slow.

[03:26] <stevan> autrijus: it gets to the 4th test on my machine (powerbook 1.5 gHz)

[03:26] <stevan> autrijus: make that the 5th test,.. so it only skips one

[03:26] <autrijus> that's what I remember

[03:26] <autrijus> keep it that way

[03:26] <stevan> autrijus: actually the test is commented out,.. the one that takes too long

[03:27] <autrijus> sure

[03:27] <SyntaxNinja> autrijus: I take it that stuff like the non-exhaustive pattern in bindEmpty (Bind.hs:67) is taken care of elsewhere in the code?

[03:27] <stevan> we can just remove that skip()?

[03:27] <autrijus> stevan: fine

[03:27] <stevan> doing it now

[03:27] <autrijus> SyntaxNinja: it is, but let me add a base case, thanks for the catch

[03:28] <autrijus>     other   -> error "Impossible - unknown slurpy sigil in param: " ++ other

[03:29] <autrijus> I mean error $.

[03:29] <autrijus> but it should be fine now.

[03:29] <SyntaxNinja> autrijus: for that kinda stuff, I tend to leave out the base case, unless you're sure you'll never add new types

[03:29] <SyntaxNinja> because that gets rid of the wanring, which you actually want :)

[03:29] <SyntaxNinja> but I guess a better error message is a good thing

[03:29] <autrijus> yeah.

[03:29] <autrijus> it's okay if the base case is just error"" I think

[03:30] <SyntaxNinja> why equality instead of pattern matching for mergeJunk (Junk.hs:44)

[03:31] <autrijus> uh, I think damian will be unhappy

[03:31] <autrijus> it's Junc :)

[03:31] <autrijus> for junctions

[03:31] <SyntaxNinja> and you're missing patterns there too. I can add error cases for these things if you like

[03:31] <SyntaxNinja> sorry :(

[03:31] <autrijus> no prob

[03:31] <SyntaxNinja> <--- really bad speller

[03:31] <autrijus> sure, if you can refactor and add error cases and/or improve withpattern matching

[03:31] <autrijus> I'd be very grateful

[03:32] <stevan> autrijus: r333 commited

[03:32] <SyntaxNinja> OK. be sur eto take a look at any error catch-alls I add in case they're actually bugs :)

[03:32] <autrijus> how would you like to be credited in AUTHORS? :) your name, that is

[03:32] <stevan> all tests pass clean now

[03:32] <autrijus> stevan++

[03:32] <buu> heh

[03:32] <buu> Too bad theres no bot to record karma

[03:32] <stevan> autrijus: your welcome :)

[03:32] <crysflame> nice!

[03:32] <SyntaxNinja> just Isaac Jones :)

[03:33] <autrijus> buu: and your name/cpan id, too :)

[03:33] <buu> Hrm. You know, I can't get 'buu' as a cpan ID

[03:33] <crysflame> why not?

[03:33] <buu> three letters =/

[03:33] <buu> Minimum is 4, I think.

[03:34] <autrijus> JHI@cpan.

[03:34] <buu> hrm

[03:34] <buu> Lemme check again

[03:34] <crysflame> JHI might be grandfathered

[03:34] <obra> I could beieve that jhi@ is historical. yeah.

[03:34] <crysflame> buu: ignore the rules. just apply and cc: autrijus.

[03:34] <buu> heh

[03:34] <crysflame> probably won't work

[03:34] <crysflame> BUT

[03:34] <crysflame> never doubt the power of humans evaluating rulesets flexibly

[03:34] <buu> Oh hey

[03:35] <crysflame> just don't bet on it =)

[03:35] <buu> Desired ID: 3-9 characters match [A-Z]

[03:35] <autrijus> nah, there is NBR, RDF

[03:35] <buu> I swear it said 4 last time =]

[03:36] <autrijus> oh no. group photo time.

[03:36] <ingy> haha

[03:36] <crysflame> heh

[03:36] * autrijus tries evasion technique

[03:36] <stevan> :)

[03:37] <buu> autrijus: Is there any particular reason you use the period in print << '.';  ?

[03:37] <autrijus> just a personal habit

[03:37] <autrijus> "." usually ends a mail

[03:37] <buu> Yeah

[03:37] <mugwump> I like "...", yaml style

[03:37] <autrijus> that works too.

[03:38] <crysflame> people don't say . as the entirety of a line intentionally in any case i've ever seen except ascii art

[03:38] <buu> I've always prefered HEREDOC_ENDS_HERE, but I may be compensating for something.

[03:38] <autrijus> heh

[03:38] <autrijus> sigh. evasion failed.

[03:38] <autrijus> will be back in a while.

[03:38] <autrijus> &

[03:39] <ihb> buu: haha

[03:40] <buu> autrijus: Nice CPAN id

[03:40] <ingy> I like the deprecated print <<;

[03:41] <buu> ingy: where?

[03:41] <ihb> <<'.' goes well with how formats are defined too.

[03:43] <ingy> buu: '<<' is terminated with a blankline

[03:44] <buu> ingy: Oh, right. I thought you were referring to it in use someplace.

[03:45] <buu> ingy: You are the author of Module::Install, yes?

[03:45] <stevan> autrijus: are you releasing a new version to CPAN tonight/today?

[03:45] <autrijus> I'm releasing it in another hour.

[03:45] <autrijus> after lunch, that is

[03:45] <autrijus> or during lunch, if we have wireless there

[03:46] <stevan> autrijus: cool. I am writing a perlmonks meditation, and i wanted to point people to the latest code

[03:46] <ingy> buu: autrijus and I coauthored originally

[03:46] <autrijus> wonderful. it will take a bit to propagate though.

[03:46] <buu> ingy: Ah. I was just going to ask A) Why does it still produce a Makefile and B) Would you prefer Module::Build?

[03:46] <stevan> autrijus: what will be the version number?

[03:46] <ingy> buu: it does both

[03:46] <autrijus> but you can always point people at http://autrijus.org/dist/Perl6-Pugs-6.0.9.tar.gz

[03:46] <autrijus> 6.0.9.

[03:47] <ingy> at the same time even

[03:47] <autrijus> gone &

[03:47] <buu> ingy: Er, it does?

[03:47] <autrijus> it can do both :)

[03:47] <ingy> buu: last time I checked :)

[03:48] <buu> Er, so can I just copy it to Build.PL and not have to futz about with nmake?

[03:48] <ingy> let me check...

[03:49] <buu> Is there some advantage to producing a Makefile over a build.pl script?

[03:49] <abstraction> '$*ARGS is chomped;'

[03:49] <abstraction> doesn't work

[03:50] <ihb> stevan: about Class::StrongSingleton; is there any chance that you'd consider changing _init to something else that won't get accidentally overridden so easily? :-) consider some distant subclass that just adds an "innocent 'private' initialization help sub".

[03:50] <ingy> buu: depends on what the various plugins depend on

[03:51] <stevan> ihb: sure I would consider that

[03:51] <stevan> ihb: any suggestions?

[03:52] <buu> ingy: "The 'Build' method does not exist in the 'inc' path! Please remove the 'inc' directory and run build.pl again to load it"

[03:52] <ihb> stevan: init_singleton? anything more than just init. and my preference is to not use a leading underscore for anything that should be used outside of the package, but that's me.

[03:53] <buu> stevan: *{ "this method will never get overridden. Ever" } = sub { init! }

[03:53] <stevan> ihb: well you should really only use it in subclasses

[03:53] <stevan> buu: thats difficult to call though

[03:53] <stevan> *{ "this method will never get overridden. Ever" }()

[03:53] <stevan> yuk :P

[03:54] <ihb> stevan: it's easy to call. my $init = 'this method will never get overridden'; $foo->$m;

[03:54] <buu> stevan: =]

[03:54] <stevan> ihb: true.... didnt think of that

[03:54] <buu> (Or of course: my $init = sub { }; $init->() )

[03:55] <stevan> ihb: I will look at the code tonight and see what I can do

[03:56] <ihb> stevan: anyway, i know it's not a widely supported opinion, but i reserve _foo for things that *no one* but me should have to care about, which includes subclass authors. i also call private methods as _foo($self => @args) so the call won't accidentally "leak" out.

[03:57] * buu whinges about stupid make

[03:57] <stevan> ihb: I try to reserve _foo for private methods, but it's also useful for just non-public (aka protected)

[03:58] <ihb> btw, i don't know how on/off-topic #perl6 is, but perhaps we should move this conversation to #perl?

[03:59] <abstraction> the 1990's called, they want there perl5 back.

[03:59] <ingy> buu: what are you using M::I for?

[03:59] <stevan> ihb: if you want to send me an email that might be easier,.. since it is pretty specific to one module too

[04:00] <buu> ingy: Um. Pugs?

[04:01] <ingy> buu: do you have M::I installed?

[04:02] <buu> Apparently not

[04:03] <ingy> it has 7000 deps

[04:03] <buu> Great

[04:03] <buu> PPM has it

[04:03] <buu> (Why the fuck does ppm s/::/-/g ?? )

[04:03] <ingy> if you install it, you can delete the inc directory

[04:04] <ihb> stevan: nah, i'm happy with you considering it. :-)

[04:04] <stevan> ihb: cool

[04:04] <stevan> ihb: init_StrongSingleton()?

[04:04] <buu> "Creating new 'Build' script for 'Perl6-Pugs' version '6.0.8'

[04:05] <abstraction> CamelCaseInPerlSucks

[04:05] <buu> "Can't copy ('lib\perl6\lib\Test.pm', 'blib\lib\Perl6\lib\Test.pm'): bad file descriptor at base.pm line 2691

[04:05] <stevan> abstraction: toEachTheirOwn 

[04:05] <abstraction> iGuess

[04:06] <ihb> stevan: anything but _init and with an indicator to the class works for me.

[04:06] <wolverian> abstraction: class names use that by convention :)

[04:06] <abstraction> wolverian, right

[04:06] <stevan> ihb: look for an update in a day or two

[04:06] <ihb> will do. thanks.

[04:08] * buu pokes ingy

[04:08] <wolverian> I hate ruby because: attr_reader doesn't autocreate the instance variables when I pass them to new(). perl6 must do this. :(

[04:08] <wolverian> now, time to sleep. cheers.

[04:12] <buu> Hrm

[04:12] <buu> Did you ever specify why haskell over perl?

[04:14] <SyntaxNinja> haskell is very well suited to language implementation

[04:15] <mdiep> syntaxninja: s/haskell/functional languages/, I think

[04:16] <SyntaxNinja> I get the feeling that Parsec was a factor in the choice, and parsec is, I believe, unique to Haskell

[04:16] <SyntaxNinja> but I won't speak for anyone else ;)

[04:16] <buu> What is parsec?

[04:18] <SyntaxNinja> buu: it's a library that makes it really elegant to write a parser in haskell that almost looks like a Yacc-type grammar, but it's implemented in the language itself

[04:18] <SyntaxNinja> http://www.cs.uu.nl/~daan/parsec.html

[04:18] <SyntaxNinja> it's a very good example of monadic combinators

[04:19] * buu cowers from the terror that is Monads

[04:19] <mugwump> damn you lambda programmers and your funny terms that don't have direct equivalents in other languages

[04:19] <SyntaxNinja> it's not that bad

[04:20] <buu> mugwump: I agree =]

[04:22] <stevan> ihb: uploading 0.02 to PAUSE right now

[04:23] <stevan> ihb: it was an easy change, and I left an alias to _init for backwards compatibility

[04:23] <ihb> uhm.

[04:23] <mugwump> so how do the terms "monadic container" and "polymorphism" interact, particularly if you have a class structure where everything

[04:23] <mugwump> ... "everything is an object"

[04:23] <ingy> hi

[04:24] <SyntaxNinja> mugwump: by "class structure" do you mean 'class' in the OO sense?

[04:25] <ihb> stevan: if you left _init for backwards compability, what good did the change do? the risk of accidentally overriding it is still as present as before.

[04:25] <stevan> ihb: no, the method is now called _init_StrongSingleton (sorry about the _ , I had to leave it)

[04:25] <buu> ihb: You can over ride it and not break the module

[04:25] <ingy> are you folks getting commit mail for pugs?

[04:25] <mugwump> I mean that if there exists a type O which every other type in the system can be said to be... ie everything is an "object".

[04:25] <ihb> oh, ok, yeah. gotcha.

[04:26] <stevan> ihb: and then I have *_init = \&_init_StrongSingleton after it

[04:26] <mugwump> so, you could have a monad with homogenous members - they're all "objects", but have nothing else in common

[04:26] <stevan> ingy: I dont get commit mail

[04:26] <ingy> I would like to get commit mail

[04:27] * mugwump takes his beginner question and leaves it hanging on the wall like a Koan that doesn't need answering

[04:27] <stevan> maybe it's an option on openfoundry? ask autrijus

[04:27] <SyntaxNinja> mugwump: you can do that with IORefs, kinda.

[04:27] <SyntaxNinja> mugwump: monads are more than just containers, though. lists are just containers

[04:28] <SyntaxNinja> mugwump: but you might be able to do something interesting with it anyway; perhaps it implements the "Show" class or something

[04:28] <SyntaxNinja> then you could print it out, without knowing exactly what it is

[04:29] <mugwump> so, a monad of objects is equivalent to a general Set, in a sense?

[04:29] <mugwump> or list, I guess, if it has an order

[04:30] <SyntaxNinja> I wouldn't spend a lot of time thinking of Monads as containers, if I were you :) they can be, though.

[04:37] <autrijus> rehi

[04:37] <autrijus> please smoke-test http://autrijus.org/dist/Perl6-Pugs-6.0.9.tar.gz before I upload it to CPAN?

[04:39] <crysflame> group picture url?

[04:39] * crysflame is on gprs / OS X atm, so no pugs/ghc :(

[04:40] <autrijus> crysflame: not sure when they'll post it 

[04:40] <autrijus> also, I end up running away at the last second.

[04:41] * autrijus <- hates group photo

[04:41] <crysflame> ah, understood

[04:41] <Coke_> hurm? pugs doesn't work on OS X?

[04:41] <SyntaxNinja> autrijus: I sent you a few patches.  be sure to take a look at them, since I don't always understand the context, so I might be hiding bugs. I made some notes on the last one

[04:42] <autrijus> sure. I'll do it right after the release.

[04:42] <SyntaxNinja> autrijus: I'm using the clean-up to get a bit familiar with the codebase

[04:42] <autrijus> Coke_: GHC doesn't work on a gprs phone.

[04:42] <autrijus> more specifically, the "downloading GHC" part doesn't work

[04:42] <autrijus> SyntaxNinja: cool

[04:43] <autrijus> SyntaxNinja: the darcs machine admin is on holiday so it will only be back on Monday 'mafraid

[04:43] <autrijus> meanwhile you can use http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/ or just work on your private repo :)

[04:43] <autrijus> your snapshot should be a ppretty stable one.

[04:43] <SyntaxNinja> autrijus: machine went down? sucks

[04:43] <autrijus> sucks a lot.

[04:43] <SyntaxNinja> it must have been my doing, it went down right after I ran 'darcs get' :)

[04:43] <autrijus> it's possible :)

[04:43] <autrijus> the loading was already high

[04:44] <buu> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

[04:44] <buu> $                    foo; is no longer valid code =[

[04:44] * buu weeps.

[04:45] <autrijus> I don't particularly miss that, to be honest, but my condolences for your loss

[04:45] <autrijus> ingy: ok, I'll set up commit mails.

[04:46] <autrijus> ingy: meanwhile pugscode.org has RSS.

[04:46] <Khisanth> hmm that was a very neat and tidy make test :)

[04:46] <buu> autrijus: Well yeah, I've never used it in my life, but I had the opportunity!

[04:46] <autrijus> Khisanth: 6.0.9 worked for you?

[04:47] <Khisanth> yup

[04:47] <buu> autrijus: Did you just go to .9 ?

[04:47] * Khisanth goes to play in examples

[04:48] <autrijus> buu: the last version was .8

[04:48] <autrijus> so I think it's natural to call this one .9

[04:48] <buu> Guess so =]

[04:48] <buu> autrijus: Not what I was asking =/

[04:48] <Khisanth> 682 tests, how many does perl5 have right now?

[04:48] <buu> Over 50,000 I think

[04:48] <stevan> Khisanth: a lot more than that

[04:48] <Khisanth> some might call it 6.0.8b! :p

[04:50] <autrijus> it's up. much thanks for making it happen :)

[04:51] <buu> autrijus: Er, I just ran svn update, I'm still getting 6.0.8 ?

[04:51] <stevan> autrijus: 6.0.9 worked fine for me 

[04:52] <buu> stevan: How did you get .9 ?

[04:52] <autrijus> buu: up again?

[04:53] <buu> revsion 336 ..

[04:53] <stevan> buu: http://autrijus.org/dist/Perl6-Pugs-6.0.9.tar.gz

[04:53] <crysflame> 20:52  * CPAN upload: Perl6-Pugs-6.0.9 by AUTRIJUS

[04:54] * tea running test now

[04:54] <Khisanth> this thing is drawing ascii art

[04:54] <buu> autrijus: I updated, recompiled, same version. Let me wipe it out completely

[04:55] <tea> say %undefined_hash  fail ? it was not catched

[04:55] <stevan> autrijus: tomorrow I will make sure we have tests for all of the new features listed in the changelog

[04:55] <autrijus> pugs -e "say %d"

[04:55] <autrijus> Undefined variable %d

[04:55] <autrijus> stevan: wunderbar.

[04:56] <stevan> off to sleep now, later all

[04:56] <autrijus> I'll do multidimensionals, apply SyntaxNinja's patches, and do more cleanups whilst you sleep

[04:56] <autrijus> 'nite stevan, thanks!

[04:56] <tea> it shown to me, Fail: cannot cast into [VPair]: VError "Undefined variable %d" (Val VUndef)

[04:56] <autrijus> ah!

[04:56] <stevan> autrijus: excellent

[04:56] <autrijus> tea: you are correct.

[04:57] <autrijus> the casting triggered before definedness check.

[04:57] <buu> Hrm

[04:57] <autrijus> tea: write a test in 01basic or in hash.t?

[04:57] <buu> ghc --make -o pugs src/Main.hs -src; src/Help.hs:16: version.h: No such file or directory

[04:57] <tea> but test cases was ok , All tests successful.

[04:57] <autrijus> (although I'll fix it today anyway)

[04:57] <autrijus> you want -isrc

[04:57] <autrijus> not -src

[04:58] <buu> Er, yeah, that's what I did, typo.

[04:58] <autrijus> buu: try "nmake version.h"

[04:59] <autrijus> oh wait. that's because youre nmake is broken.

[04:59] <buu> Yeah =[

[04:59] <autrijus> ok, do this first

[04:59] <autrijus> perl Makefile.PL -version

[04:59] <autrijus> after that, ghc --make should work

[04:59] <buu> Yay!

[05:00] <autrijus> :)

[05:00] <buu> Ah, and that is why my version was wrong, because I wasn't recreating that header?

[05:00] <autrijus> yup.

[05:00] <autrijus> normally nmake will update it for you

[05:00] <buu> 6.009, r336 =]

[05:00] <autrijus> woot

[05:00] <buu> Next version you'll be at "reet"

[05:01] <tea> autrijus: im not sure it, i found it in the shell. do u need version info of dependences, if it was depend on my environment

[05:01] <autrijus> tea: no, I duplicated your bug in the shell

[05:01] <autrijus> so it's certainly a pugs glitch

[05:01] <autrijus> aside from Posix calls, there's nothing that depends on environments

[05:02] <autrijus> both perl5 and ghc are notorious for platform independence :)

[05:02] <tea> ah, ok ~

[05:02] <buu> ghc is so platform independent it only runs on platforms ghc runs on. =[

[05:03] <autrijus> lol :)

[05:03] <autrijus> yeah, it's annoying that its cygwin support is partly broken

[05:04] <crysflame> pmake++ # pure-perl make

[05:05] <buu> Hey, theres a thought

[05:08] * buu tries to figure out how to install pmake without having a working make

[05:09] <autrijus> by copying files, persumably

[05:09] <autrijus> announced on p6c.

[05:10] <viirya_> autrijus: have checked the translation?

[05:11] <autrijus> viirya: yup. it looks nice

[05:11] <viirya_> I'm doing the rest.

[05:11] <autrijus> I'd like to do the final proofread after the rest is done

[05:11] <autrijus> but the first half looks very very nice.

[05:11] <autrijus> viirya++

[05:12] <autrijus> I think we can post it to newzilla... maybe tw.comp.lang.perl

[05:12] <autrijus> the usual places

[05:13] <viirya_> hcchien said he will post it on newzilla.

[05:13] <autrijus> cool.

[05:13] <clkao> cc

[05:14] <autrijus> the afternoon session is about to start. I may disappear for a bit. :)

[05:24] <crysflame> post.. what to newzilla?

[05:25] <autrijus> chinese version of pugs apocryphon 1

[05:25] <autrijus> (newzilla is a free software tech webzine run by hcchien)

[05:27] <crysflame> o, cool. i should rewad the english apocryphon.

[05:29] <autrijus> :)

[05:40] <crysflame> (1, 5, 2, 4, 3).quicksort.say;

[05:40] <crysflame> Is there a reason why that last line is not written

[05:40] <crysflame> say quicksort (1, 5, 2, 4, 3);

[05:41] <autrijus> ah. if someone can quote S06 at that thread I'd be grateful

[05:41] <buu> Why do you say S06 instead of S6?

[05:41] <autrijus> because there's S12

[05:41] <buu> Er, so?

[05:41] <autrijus> and the url is called S06.html and S06.pod

[05:41] <autrijus> so I'm merely repeating the url :)

[05:41] <buu> heh

[05:42] <autrijus> ( http://dev.perl.org/perl6/synopsis/S06.html )

[05:42] <buu> Right

[05:42] <autrijus> but anyway. saying

[05:42] <autrijus> sub say ($x) { ... }

[05:42] <autrijus> is like saying

[05:42] <autrijus> sub say ($x:) { ... }

[05:42] <autrijus> which means that $x is an invocant

[05:42] <autrijus> $x.say

[05:42] <autrijus> is just a way to write

[05:42] <autrijus> say($x:)

[05:43] <autrijus> which is just say($x)

[05:43] <autrijus> so they are almost always interchangeable.

[05:43] <buu> Head.. exploding

[05:43] <buu> On another note, do you have a pugdoc ?

[05:43] <autrijus> buu: S06 explains it all :)

[05:43] <autrijus> no, not yet.

[05:43] <autrijus> just open your browser to docs/*

[05:44] <buu> Any plans for one?

[05:44] <autrijus> I think they'll eventually be coverted to kwid

[05:44] <autrijus> sure. ingy is the person to ask

[05:44] <autrijus> a perldoc that groks kwid, that is

[05:44] <autrijus> maybe it can be done as a Pod::Simple plugin as well.

[05:45] <crysflame> somene asked for a kwiki that's based on pod at one point

[05:45] <crysflame> i think ingy finished it

[05:45] <crysflame> it might have been robrt, on behalf of perl5/pod/*.pod

[05:46] <buu> autrijus: Oh, I was considering writing one, but I don't want to step on anyones toes or something.

[05:46] <autrijus> buu: just go ahead.

[05:46] <autrijus> there's very little toestepping around here :)

[05:46] <buu> heh

[05:46] <buu> I don't suppose a kwid parser exists..

[05:47] <autrijus> buu: read pugs\lib\Perl6\lib\perlkwid.kwid for spec

[05:47] <autrijus> it is supposed to be <=> with POD

[05:47] <autrijus> (where <=> reads "isomorphic")

[05:47] <autrijus> Kwiki parser is available on CPAN; you can adopt that

[05:48] <buu> Hrm

[05:48] <autrijus> (Kwiki.pm)

[05:48] <autrijus> or write your own

[05:48] <autrijus> in any language you prefer :)

[05:48] <autrijus> as long as it's not BF or Lazy K...

[05:48] <buu> And of course the next question, any useful docs?

[05:48] * buu writes it in BL

[05:48] <autrijus> buu: perlkwid.kwid

[05:48] <autrijus> itself is written in kwid

[05:48] <autrijus> so if you can parse that, you're set

[05:48] <autrijus> I think gugod volunteered to convert PA01 to kwid as well.

[05:49] <buu> perl6doc ?

[05:49] <autrijus> I think pugsdoc or kwidoc for now

[05:49] <autrijus> if you're asking for the name of the script 

[05:49] <buu> Oh, no, sorry

[05:50] <buu> You know, I really hate when people just type "?" to me, I should stop doing that =/

[05:50] <autrijus> heh :)

[05:50] <autrijus> yeah, complete sentences help

[05:50] <buu> What I meant to ask was "This documeng is in Kwid format. To read this, use a Kwid formatter, like 'perl6doc perlkwid'"

[05:50] <autrijus> oh. it doesn't exist yet.

[05:50] <buu> Ah

[05:51] <buu> Wow. Perl6.

[05:52] <buu> And earlier I was asking, is there any actual documentation equivalent to perlvar, perlfunc, perlop, etc, in existance for perl6, or just the synopsis?

[05:52] <autrijus> there is synopses, apocalypses, exegesis

[05:52] <buu> Great!

[05:52] <autrijus> in descending order of normativeness

[05:53] <buu> Maybe I can write perlvar and make it actually parseable.

[05:53] <autrijus> it's all in the left side navbar of dev.perl.org/perl6/

[05:53] <autrijus> that will be wonderful.

[05:53] <autrijus> also check the two books mentioned in PA01.

[05:53] <buu> autrijus: Right, I see it. I was just wondering if any of the work had already been done.

[05:53] <autrijus> there used to be a list called perl6-documentation

[05:53] <autrijus> which didn't actually produce any normative documents

[05:53] <buu> Awesome.

[05:53] <autrijus> but its archive at nntp.perl.org may be worth looking

[05:54] <autrijus> there's many 80% complete docs

[05:54] <autrijus> if you can salvage those I'd be very very very grateful.

[05:54] <buu> Hey, theres a thought.

[05:55] <autrijus> do subscribe p6c and post yoru findings there :)

[05:56] <autrijus> it has a beter chance of being read on p6c.

[05:56] <buu> p6c is perl6-compiler, yes?

[05:56] <autrijus> yeah.

[05:56] <buu> Well, if I find anything useful and/or actually accomplish something

[05:56] <autrijus> buu++ # thanks in advance

[05:56] <buu> =[

[05:57] <buu> So does kwid have any official standing?

[05:58] <autrijus> suppose that it's only been specified less than a day ago

[05:58] <autrijus> I'd say no :)

[05:58] <buu> haha

[05:58] <autrijus> but failing better alternatives, I think I'll adopt it for pugs.

[05:58] <SyntaxNinja> autrijus: so is Rule basically a fork of parsec?

[05:58] <buu> Sounds reasonble.

[05:59] <autrijus> SyntaxNinja: yup. now 6.0.9 is out I plan to redo the monad so it's put inside the Eval monad

[05:59] <autrijus> SyntaxNinja: which will land tomorrow with luck

[05:59] <autrijus> SyntaxNinja: problem with Parsec is that it doesn't have a ParsecT

[05:59] <autrijus> which is why I forked it to work on it in the first place

[05:59] <SyntaxNinja> autrijus: can you send your changes upstream?

[06:00] <autrijus> SyntaxNinja: of course yse

[06:00] <autrijus> once it's anything near coherent I'll sned upstream.

[06:00] <autrijus> I think a ParsecT will benefit many.

[06:00] <SyntaxNinja> autrijus: because there are changes I'd like to make in there, to clean stuff up, but they really blong upstream

[06:00] <autrijus> (I hope, anyway.)

[06:00] <autrijus> SyntaxNinja: sure, I'll push them for you too

[06:00] <autrijus> SyntaxNinja: it is my hope that pugs can result in many toolchain contributions and cleanups to haskell libraries

[06:01] <autrijus> (eg. the test coverage tool discussed here a while ago)

[06:01] <autrijus> hi coaster.

[06:01] <coaster> hi

[06:02] <SyntaxNinja> autrijus: cool

[06:02] <autrijus> coaster: first time here? :)

[06:02] <coaster> yes

[06:02] <autrijus> nice. how did you find out this place?

[06:03] <coaster> saw the post about pugs on perl monks

[06:03] <autrijus> (btw, Pugs 6.0.9 has been released, if you'd like to try it put.)

[06:03] <autrijus> s/put/out/

[06:03] <autrijus> ahh. cool

[06:03] <autrijus> so, got some time to help out writing tests and/or examples and/or libraries? :)

[06:03] <SyntaxNinja> autrijus: is "XXX" your version of "fixme"?

[06:03] <autrijus> SyntaxNinja: yeah.

[06:04] <shapr> oh hey! I have a suggestion for that.

[06:04] <autrijus> shapr: mm?

[06:04] <SyntaxNinja> autrijus: I ignored warnings that were in close proximity to XXX

[06:04] <coaster> i suppose :D

[06:04] <autrijus> coaster: woot! :)

[06:04] <shapr> I asked about XXX on the Pragmatic Programmers list and a smart guy in Berkely said that he uses XX XXX XXXX ...

[06:04] <autrijus> right, I read that too

[06:04] <SyntaxNinja> shapr: why?

[06:04] <autrijus> it's eerie

[06:04] <shapr> http://www.scannedinavian.com/2005-02-02.html

[06:05] <shapr> minor/normal/severe issues.

[06:05] <SyntaxNinja> heh

[06:05] <shapr> autrijus: oh you read that already?

[06:05] <SyntaxNinja> you could use FIXXXXX also ;)

[06:05] <autrijus> coaster: so, try getting pugs built on your system, and play around a bit; if you run into anything bizzare/limiting/ugly, scream here or on perl6-compiler :)

[06:05] <shapr> autrijus: I'm not used to dealing with other people who restlessly absorb info.

[06:06] <coaster> yeah i got it built, messing around with it now

[06:06] * shapr boings happily

[06:06] <autrijus> shapr: seems we're built with similar materials :)

[06:06] <shapr> truly

[06:06] <shapr> Once again, I very much hope we can end up in the same physical space for a few days. I think I would enjoy that much.

[06:06] <autrijus> I think euroscon

[06:06] <autrijus> or icfp

[06:06] <shapr> yeah

[06:06] <autrijus> are both likely venues.

[06:06] <SyntaxNinja> autrijus: so should I go ahead and clean up warnings in Rule also?

[06:07] <autrijus> SyntaxNinja: yes, yes definitely.

[06:07] <SyntaxNinja> OK. I'm just worried about the conflict situation w/ upstream, but they're annoying, so I'll go ahead

[06:07] <autrijus> that will make my time in MonadT'ing it much more enjoyable

[06:07] <SyntaxNinja> they meaning the warnings

[06:07] <autrijus> and more coherent when I push them upstream

[06:09] <autrijus> ok, I need to run now.

[06:09] <autrijus> be back in a couple hours.

[06:09] <autrijus> see you! &

[06:09] <SyntaxNinja> Pos is weird. I wonder why he doesn't use field accessors

[06:10] <shapr> I know of several people who've got Parsec extensions/additions/changes, including me.

[06:12] <SyntaxNinja> is upstream slow to accept them?

[06:12] <SyntaxNinja> post to libraries@ :)

[06:14] <shapr> Slow to accept them is an understatement :-) I sent a bunch of stuff to Daan and he said "yeah, this is cool"

[06:24] <SyntaxNinja> that sucks. post them to libraries@!

[06:25] <SyntaxNinja> someone will handle it

[06:44] <crysflame> .

[06:44] <shapr> ,

[06:44] <shapr> really big semicolon!

[08:09] <buu> Hrm

[08:17] <buu> The trolls have attacked!

[08:18] <shapr> Quick! under the bridge!

[08:21] <buu> But that's where the trolls live!

[08:21] <shapr> oh, never mind then. Burn the bridges behind us!

[08:21] <buu> Good idea

[08:22] <buu> But I lack an inflammable substance!

[08:23] <rgs> flamewar against trolls ?

[08:24] <buu> Mildly

[08:24] <buu> There was only one.

[09:30] <crysflame> trolls? o no!

[09:31] <crysflame> ~/win 3

[09:32] <buu> ... What?

[09:33] <scw> Hello! Where are duplicated '\\n   List      pre     values  (Hash)\' when defining initSyms in Prim.hs

[09:33] <scw> Is there any reason?

[09:34] <scw> Besides, function 'values' can also apply to junction, but it seams it anly accept Hash now :)

[09:34] <scw> s/anly/only/

[09:39] <buu> Hrm

[09:40] <buu> I want an aujitrus so I can bitch

[09:50] <buu> Anyone understand kwid here?

[09:50] <buu> .list

[09:50] <buu> -foo

[09:50] <buu> bar

[09:51] <buu> -baz

[09:51] <buu> .list.

[10:38] <theorbtwo> Somebody should make the chan's topic mention that it's logged.

[10:38] <theorbtwo> (I don't care, but I can imagine other people caring.)

[10:38] <shapr> can you change the topic?

[10:38] <crysflame> we're logged now?

[10:38] * crysflame shrugs

[10:39] *** shapr changes topic to: Run Perl6 Now! | pugscode.org (see 'Overview' and 'Journal') | pugs.kwiki.org | test

[10:39] <shapr> theorbtwo: go forth and add that info to the topic.

[10:39] <scw> crysflame: definitely http://colabti.de/irclogger/irclogger_logs/perl6

[10:40] *** crysflame changes topic to: Run Perl6 Now! | pugscode.org ('Overview', 'Journal') | pugs.kwiki.org | now with logging: http://colabti.de/irclogger/irclogger_logs/perl6

[10:40] <crysflame> if it's undesirable to log it, that'll help identify that a situation exists

[10:40] <crysflame> if it's desirable, now we know

[10:41] <crysflame> someone should shorten that url though :)

[10:44] *** theorbtwo changes topic to: Run Perl6 Now! | pugscode.org ('Overview', 'Journal') | pugs.kwiki.org | now with logging: http://xrl.us/e98m

[10:45] <shapr> Can't we get someone with a top-level domain to do *really* short urls?

[10:45] <shapr> http://go/here

[10:46] <crysflame> i know someone with a tld

[10:46] <shapr> Which one?

[10:46] <crysflame> one of the cc codes

[10:47] <crysflame> http://zs/x/blah

[10:47] <crysflame> zs is made up, for example purposes

[10:48] <shapr> I want a .aq domain.

[10:50] * theorbtwo hears it's possible to get your passport stamped in Antartica (even though it isn't a country).

[10:50] <shapr> Who owns Aq anyway?

[10:50] <shapr> Can I just setup shop there with no rules?

[10:51] <shapr> Would be a nice way to escape a bunch of stupid copyright and patent laws.

[10:51] <theorbtwo> Most of the world considers it under the direct juristiction of the UN, IIRC.  (Except France, who considers part of it under their direct juristiction.)

[10:55] <theorbtwo> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Antarctica

[10:55] <rgs> only the part known as "terre adlie"

[10:55] <theorbtwo> (In other words, I'm completely wrong.)

[10:57] <crysflame> oh, neat. it's illegal for those under American jurisdiction in America to pollute Antarctica in any way

[10:57] <crysflame> which includes discharge of pollutants

[10:57] <crysflame> which means oil mining is ilegal

[11:00] <theorbtwo> ...and Article 8 of the Antarctic Treaty stipulates that US law holds for US citizens in Antarctica.

[11:02] <crysflame> otherwise the mafia would go nuts

[11:02] <theorbtwo> Oh, and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty prohibits oil mining as well, for the citizens of 27 countries (including china, the US, and most of the EU).

[11:02] <crysflame> woot!

[11:06] * rgs wants a .moon

[11:06] <shapr> I've wondered about interplanetary tcp/ip

[11:07] <theorbtwo> IIRC, there's an RFC on it, and TCP/IP over satalite isn't that uncommon.

[11:07] <theorbtwo> For that matter, TCP/IP over moon bounce probably isn't /terribly/ uncommon.

[11:11] <theorbtwo> Ah, RFC 3271 mentions that the current NASA Mars activities use interplanetary IP.

[11:14] <theorbtwo> Heh, 2775: "It should also be noted that since the speed of light is not set by an IETF standard..."

[11:15] * crysflame blinks

[11:17] <theorbtwo> Too far off-topic?

[11:19] * shapr snickers

[11:19] <shapr> that's cute.

[11:25] <theorbtwo> .oO(TCP/IP over philotic links?)

[13:35] <YJ> hi

[13:36] <YJ> is there anyone here can give me a little help?

[13:36] <theorbtwo> Can try.

[13:36] <YJ> thx

[13:36] <YJ> i can't generate html with perl

[13:37] <integral> YJ: with pugs?

[13:37] <YJ> i tryed googling the question

[13:37] <integral> I don't suppose #perl6 does perl5 questions...

[13:37] <theorbtwo> You don't want this channel, then.  This is for perl6; you're using perl5.

[13:37] <YJ> ehm.. pugs?

[13:37] <theorbtwo> Try #perl.

[13:37] <YJ> oh

[13:37] <YJ> ok

[13:37] <YJ> bye than

[13:37] <YJ> thx

[14:01] <Steve_p> Hmmm...`say "<html><body><h1>Welcome to pugs</h1></body></html>"` 

[14:19] <autrijus> rehi!

[14:20] <rgs> hi autrijus 

[14:21] <autrijus> yo. got more time for pugs? :)

[14:21] <rgs> no. Perl 5 and real work keep me busy

[14:21] <rgs> (and haskell tutorials)

[14:22] <autrijus> ycheng: 0100 is no longer 64 in perl6.

[14:22] <autrijus> ycheng: it is either a warning, an error, or just 100.

[14:22] <clkao> autrijus!

[14:22] <autrijus> clkao!

[14:22] <clkao> i need you to fix get_prompt on win32

[14:22] <autrijus> just had some really good beijing ducks

[14:22] <clkao> it blocks 0.30

[14:22] <autrijus> ok, fixing now

[14:23] <clkao> oh well, hack, you are in beijing.

[14:23] <autrijus> meanwhile do you have svn-1.1.x?

[14:23] <autrijus> 1.1.3 built to win32?

[14:23] <clkao> as ?

[14:23] <clkao> i don't have win32

[14:23] <autrijus> as something that can replace 1.1.0 in win32 bindists?

[14:23] <clkao> svn on win32

[14:23] <clkao> i don't know, the one branko built can't be used?

[14:23] <autrijus> I'll try...

[14:23] <autrijus> wagner is down

[14:23] <autrijus> my notes are gone

[14:24] <autrijus> hmm it responds to ping

[14:25] <autrijus> clkao: so what was broken again? just the resolution part?

[14:25] <clkao> move to #svk

[14:46] <autrijus> sigh.

[14:49] <clkao> you want svk

[14:50] <autrijus> I wish svk doesn't take ~1hr to sync all revisions though :)

[14:50] <clkao> 11checkout fixed

[14:50] <autrijus> in particular I want the [h]ead option to work.

[14:50] <clkao> i works

[14:50] <clkao> it works

[14:50] <clkao> it's been fixed long ago

[14:50] <autrijus> oh. right. it works.

[14:50] <autrijus> I keep stuck in the past. sorry

[14:51] <autrijus> got burned too many times, etc.

[14:51] <ycheng> autrijus: got it.

[14:51] <autrijus> ycheng: so, will you kindly revert your commit, or (preferably) change it to emit a fatal error?

[14:51] <ycheng> autrijus: I am puting it back.

[14:51] <autrijus> like, returning a VError.

[14:51] <autrijus> I think I want it be an error.

[14:52] <autrijus> which is what lwall said, too

[14:52] <ycheng> I'll try to revert it first.

[14:52] <ycheng> I do that for I want to write "chmod".

[14:52] <autrijus> ycheng: nono, I think your infrastructure is fine

[14:52] <autrijus> just change it to emit VError

[14:52] <autrijus> which is what we want

[14:53] <ycheng> autrijus: make 0100 a error ?

[14:53] <autrijus> reboot, bbiab. &

[14:53] <theorbtwo> I think thta's what he meant, ycheng.

[14:53] <theorbtwo> that's

[14:54] <ycheng> theorbtwo: see.

[14:54] <ycheng> well, it will take me some time to study how to return a VError :)

[15:00] <stevan> autrijus: I responded to http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=434972 

[15:00] <stevan> I hope I got it right :P

[15:03] * Steve_p takes a peek

[15:03] <theorbtwo> Looks good to me, thilo.

[15:03] <theorbtwo> Er, stevan.

[15:05] <Steve_p> Actually, the "hello world".foo will feel very familiar to ruby programmers

[15:06] <Steve_p> It actually can be also done in Java, but I've seen it much more in Ruby

[15:08] <stevan> Steve_p: I understand the autoboxing, but foo() is not a method of the String class, so I think that is where the confusion is

[15:08] <Steve_p> If you mixin, it will be :)

[15:08] <stevan> theorbtwo: thanks 

[15:08] <stevan> Steve_p: I prefer to view it as RPN perl

[15:08] <stevan> "hello world" .foo

[15:08] <integral> isn't it just that method calls now additionally look in other namespaces other than the class for (multi)methods?

[15:09] <integral> (like C++ Koenig lookup I suppose)

[15:09] <stevan> integral: they seem to have called it invocant parameters in S06

[15:09] <Steve_p> Also, the scriptable programming paradigm in Perl 6 seems to allow it

[15:09] <stevan> and not associated it with object 

[15:09] <integral> *nod* it's just unifying the CLOS generic method type syntax of method(obj, args), with obj->method(args)

[15:10] <stevan> part of me likes it, the other part is not so sure

[15:10] <stevan> but hey,.. this is all new stuff,.. so it will take some time

[15:11] <Steve_p> I'm guessing it could get very messy if you aren't careful, but that can be dealt with

[15:11] <stevan> Steve_p.do.mean.whatever

[15:11] <stevan> or rather Steve_p.mean.you.do.whatever

[15:12] <stevan> It has the same smell as method chaining

[15:12] <stevan> which I like sometimes, and don't like other times

[15:12] <theorbtwo> It's one of those "there's nobody forcing you to use it" things.

[15:13] <stevan> theorbtwo: exactly

[15:13] <stevan> TMTIWTDO

[15:13] <stevan> bah ,... TIMTOWTDI

[15:13] * stevan needs more coffee

[15:16] <Steve_p> Mmm...method chaining

[15:16] * Steve_p hugs Perl 6

[15:20] <nnunley> HRm... is this a valid test for junction equivalance?  ok all(4|5|6 + 3) == one(7|8|9)

[15:22] <nnunley> Hrm.  Minor syntax error... all((4|5|6) + 3) == one(7|8|9)

[15:25] <theorbtwo> Hm.  We spew errors pretty badly when compiling under -Wall.

[15:27] <Steve_p> ghc -Wall?

[15:27] <theorbtwo> Yeah.

[15:30] <scw> nnunley: Seems correct? I think like this:

[15:30] <scw> nnunley: all((4|5|6) + 3) make all(any(7, 8, 9)) and one(7|8|9) becomes one(any(7, 8, 9)), then ALL the any(7, 8, 9) match ONE of the any(7, 8, 9)

[15:31] <nnunley> scw: That was my thought.

[15:31] <scw>  (any(7, 8, 9) is a single element..)

[15:31] <nnunley> scw: Cool.  The middle element is an error case right now in pugs.

[15:32] <nnunley> scw: It's validating one of the synopsis assertions.

[15:37] <scw> nnunley: Er, I didn't follow. What do you mean?

[15:37] <nnunley> Try this:  ok all((4|5|6) + 3) == one(7|8|9), "all elements in junction are incremented";

[15:37] <nnunley> Just writing test cases to follow S03

[15:38] <nnunley> it will pass 2 out of 3 times.

[15:39] <nnunley> I'm just trying to make sure that my test is not flawed.

[15:43] <scw> Quite strange.. It won't pass if I use Test module, but print correct string if not.

[15:45] <nnunley> I guess it's a side effect of Test.

[15:46] <nnunley> Committed it for public examination.

[15:49] <scw> I think the problem comes from parameter.

[15:49] <scw> I wrote a function:  sub test($cond){ say 'true' if $cond; say 'false' if !$cond; }

[15:50] <scw> Then, test(0|1) prints both

[15:51] * nnunley nods.

[15:52] <nnunley> It's currently hitting 3 of the 9 branches.

[15:53] <nnunley> So I would expect either 9 evaluations(3 pass, 6 fail), or 3 evaluations (all pass).

[15:55] <scw> Oh! I totally forgot when junction is evaluated branches are taken!

[15:56] * nnunley nods.

[15:56] <nnunley> So passing 2 of 3 is odd.

[15:58] <scw> But why only 3 branches?

[15:58] <nnunley> Right.

[15:58] <nnunley> Good question.

[15:59] <scw> Or, why are there 3 branches. By interactive mode, all((4|5|6) + 3) == one(7|8|9) has value ((((bool::false | bool::true))))

[15:59] <nnunley> Though I believe the == colapses the state.

[16:01] <scw> Is there any discussion of equality of qunction in Synopses?

[16:01] * crysflame smiles

[16:01] <crysflame> the first bug i found in pugs was with junctions. also 2nd, 3rd.

[16:02] <nnunley> At least we're fixing them before they become actual threads.

[16:03] <crysflame> all(4|5|6) + 3) results in (7|8|9)

[16:03] * nnunley nods.

[16:03] <nnunley> WHich is in S03.

[16:03] <crysflame> all(7|8|9) == one(7|8|9) is a 3x3 matrix of results

[16:03] <crysflame> (7|8|9) == 7

[16:03] <crysflame> (7|8|9) == 8

[16:03] <crysflame> (7|8|9) == 9

[16:03] <nnunley> and only the diagnal is true.

[16:03] <crysflame> but since it's all(7|8|9), all three are true

[16:03] <crysflame> so it should collapse to a 3x1

[16:04] <crysflame> er, 1x3

[16:04] <crysflame> and all three are true, so it should collapse down to true

[16:04] * nnunley nods.

[16:06] <crysflame> all(7 or 8 or 9) == one (7|8|9)

[16:06] <crysflame> oh

[16:06] <crysflame> it wouldn't collapse down to true

[16:06] <crysflame> er..

[16:06] * crysflame twitches

[16:06] <crysflame> well, if there's a bug in comparing all(x..z) == one(x|y|z) then i could see why, at least

[16:07] <crysflame> all(one(x|y)) == all(x|y)?

[16:07] <crysflame> if not, then my logic is wrong.

[16:07] * crysflame &

[16:07] <PerlJam> your logic sure sounds wrong.

[16:08] <PerlJam> all(7,8,9) can not == one(7,8,9)

[16:08] <nnunley> I thought I was stating:  for all a in list a, there exists b in list a that is equivalent.

[16:09] <nnunley> s/list/junction/

[16:12] <nnunley> Changing the signature of Test::ok from ($cond, ...) to (Bool $cond,...) does cause it to collapse according to my expectation.

[16:12] <Juerd> PerlJam: Isn't that: all(7 == one(7,8,9), 8 == one(7,8,9), 9 == one(7,8,9)) and thus true?

[16:14] <PerlJam> Juerd: hold on, let me check the synopsis on the order of evaluation.

[16:15] <nnunley> I think that might still just be living in the chatter on p6l.

[16:15] <Juerd> IIRC, right expands first

[16:15] <nnunley> That's what I remember reading, too.

[16:16] <ycheng> autrijus[tw]: I make 01 error ("010 is not octal in perl6 anymore, use 0o10")

[16:16] <crysflame> i'm thinking in pure math, not in precedence of collapse, fwiw.

[16:17] <ycheng> autrijus[tw]: should I make 090 error, too. (9 is not 0-7)

[16:17] <theorbtwo> Having one work and not the other is a gross violation of least surprise.

[16:18] <PerlJam> Juerd: oh, you're indeed correct.

[16:18] <PerlJam> damn junctions to the hell of quantum confusion  ;)

[16:18] * nnunley grins.

[16:18] <crysflame> aw, they're not confusing

[16:18] <nnunley> Just set theory.

[16:18] <crysflame> just very meticulous in proving shortcuts wrong

[16:18] <crysflame> repeatedly

[16:18] * crysflame never trusts anything with set math yet

[16:19] <PerlJam> nnunley: If it's just set theory why don't we call them "sets" instead of "junctions"?

[16:19] <crysflame> a list is a set

[16:19] <crysflame> a junction is not a list

[16:19] <theorbtwo> Because that'd be even more confusing for people who think a set is like a hash, but without the values.

[16:19] <crysflame> {3,4,5} = set

[16:19] <crysflame> {3|4|5} = a set that collapses when studied

[16:20] * crysflame shrugs

[16:20] <crysflame> my @list : all = (3,4,5); # maybe

[16:21] <Juerd> 17:21 < crysflame> a list is a set

[16:21] <Juerd> Lists have order, sets do not

[16:21] <crysflame> ah, neat.

[16:21] <nnunley> PerlJam: Yeap.  set has become overloaded in meaning in the programming world.

[16:21] <crysflame> i can't touch the semantic argument

[16:21] <crysflame> but set math feels a lot more sane to me than it should, apparently

[16:21] <crysflame> just can't trust any of it

[16:23] <theorbtwo> Also, lists can contain duplicates, sets cannot.

[16:26] <theorbtwo> Set math is rather insane, actually.  It's the bit where it's most obvious that it's insane, at least.

[16:27] <theorbtwo> Does the set that contains all sets that do not contain themselves contain itself?

[16:33] <scw> Set theorem prevent such paradox..

[16:35] <integral> 'nave set theory', 'axiomatic set theory' and friends...

[17:17] <autrijus> rehi. :)

[17:17] <autrijus> (web-based backlog)++

[17:18] <autrijus> theorbtwo: syntaxninja has lots of patches that cleans -Wall.

[17:18] <clkao> autrijus: while i can get a hold of you, can you test zh filenames / commitlog on win32 with svk?

[17:19] <autrijus> ok, testing

[17:28] <autrijus> syntaxninja++

[17:28] <autrijus> -Wall patch landing in a few mins.

[17:30] <crysflame> hi

[17:30] <autrijus> hey crysflame

[17:31] <ingy> hola

[17:31] <autrijus> yo ingy san

[17:32] <ingy> I started http://pugs.kwiki.org/?KwidSynopsis

[17:32] <autrijus> rocks.

[17:33] <rgs> hi ingy

[17:33] <ingy> hi rgs

[17:33] <ingy> I'm already wanting the new features from fleshing out Kwid in Kwiki

[17:36] <autrijus> new features?

[17:36] <rgs> (... sometimes you expect purl to say something.)

[17:36] <autrijus> :)

[17:36] <ingy> heh

[17:37] <ingy> things like `$foo` 

[17:37] <ingy> and also {*foo*} meaning *foo*

[17:38] <ingy> but the backticks are like crack

[17:38] <autrijus> yup

[17:38] <autrijus> how do you say raw `$foo`?

[17:39] <ingy> { `$foo` }

[17:39] <autrijus> and raw {} ?

[17:39] <ingy> or \`$foo`

[17:39] <ingy> \{}

[17:39] <autrijus> ah. totally makes sense.

[17:40] <ingy> code for `$foo` is {``$foo``} btw

[17:41] <ingy> '{`' is start tag and '`}' is end tag

[17:41] <ingy> so anything but '`}' goes inside

[17:41] <autrijus> okay.

[17:41] <autrijus> that is very regular.

[17:42] <autrijus> I think it will make an excellent example in learning parsec :)

[17:42] <ingy> and '`}' is {`\`}`}

[17:42] <autrijus> let me commit a simple ruleKwidBlock for you...

[17:42] <autrijus> and you can take over

[17:42] <ingy> please!!

[17:43] <autrijus> that way we can support the crack inline literals

[17:43] <autrijus> let me find them in synopses...

[17:43] <autrijus> riiight.

[17:44] <autrijus> %=POD{'DATA'}

[17:44] <autrijus> all PODs inside a namespace can be accessed individually

[17:44] <autrijus> as hash, or as array.

[17:44] <autrijus> or as scalar.

[17:44] <ingy> nice

[17:44] <autrijus> all comments can be read as @=COMMENT.

[17:45] <autrijus> so Smart::Comment is suddenly trivial.

[17:46] <ingy> autrijus: where will the Kwid parsec rules go?

[17:46] <autrijus> I think Parser/Kwid.hs

[17:46] <autrijus> I think.

[17:46] <theorbtwo> Hm, sigil~'='~name is very confusing.

[17:46] <autrijus> makes sense to you?

[17:46] <autrijus> theorbtwo: where's that?

[17:46] <ingy> autrijus: sounds fine

[17:46] <autrijus> oh, you mean secondary crack sigils

[17:47] <theorbtwo> @=COMMENT.

[17:47] <theorbtwo> Secondary sigils aren't bad in general, but = as a secondary sigil is.

[17:47] <autrijus> I agree. sadly I think it makes the most sense.

[17:47] <autrijus> maybe @|COMMENT

[17:47] <autrijus> %|POD{'DATA'}

[17:48] <theorbtwo> Looks better.

[17:48] <autrijus> feel free to raise on p6l. for now I'll do the spec :)

[17:48] <theorbtwo> OTOH, that might be an artifact of the variable-width font I'm viewing this with.

[17:50] <theorbtwo> I don't care anywhere near enough to brave the uggage of p6l.

[17:50] <autrijus> p6l is very tame nowadays :)

[17:51] <theorbtwo> Also, I feel rather bad that a couple times I've made in-passing comments, and Larry has decided to change the world just after.

[17:51] <autrijus> that doesn't sound too bad...

[17:52] <theorbtwo> Yeah, and one of those was really unrelated, I suspect.

[17:53] *** theorbtwo changes topic to: Run Perl6 Now! | pugscode.org ('Overview', 'Journal') | pugs.kwiki.org | chan now logged: http://xrl.us/e98m

[17:54] <PerlJam> heh ... for some reason my mind parsed that as "Perl6!  Run now!"  (as in "run away")

[17:54] <ihb> haha

[17:54] <theorbtwo> Hed fur de hills, sonny!  De perl6 is commin'!

[18:01] <autrijus> hi luqui!

[18:01] <luqui> hi autrijus 

[18:01] * luqui recovers from his cold and reluctantly returns to the working world

[18:01] <luqui> which probably means less pugs work...

[18:02] <autrijus> luqui: I talked steve fink into writing  http://0xdeadbeef.net/wiki/wiki.pl?FinkBlog/CodeTour

[18:03] <luqui> of P6C in parrot/languages?

[18:03] <luqui> no

[18:03] <luqui> of regex

[18:03] <theorbtwo> Does anybody here mind being mentioned in Perl6Irc on the kwiki?

[18:04] <theorbtwo> (I'm looking at you, luqui.)

[18:04] <luqui> yes I mind.  You may not use my name without express written consent!

[18:04] <luqui> :-p

[18:04] <luqui> go ahead (there's your written consent)

[18:05] <luqui> When I was writing that type-collated hash example on p6l, I realized that Perl 6's sub declaration syntax has some major flaws

[18:06] <luqui> You shouldn't have to know all that stuff about a method to wrap it

[18:06] <autrijus> although you can introspect

[18:06] <autrijus> with .arity and .param, no?

[18:07] <luqui> But that's a lot of black magic for a common operation

[18:07] <autrijus> that is true.

[18:07] <luqui> Haskell has had a profound effect on my for what it means to be concise

[18:07] <autrijus> also in quicksort, btw

[18:07] <PerlJam> surely some of it is "inheritable"?

[18:07] <autrijus> (1,2,3,4).say

[18:07] <autrijus> surely *@_ can't be invocant?

[18:07] <autrijus> so that is downright illegal?

[18:07] <luqui> The invocant idea is breaking down

[18:08] <autrijus> as is $anything.say

[18:08] <autrijus> luqui: can you elaborate? I have that feeling

[18:08] <autrijus> but can't quite say clearly

[18:08] <luqui> For instance, $anything.say seems reasonable, and in fact you'd like to be able to override say on yourself

[18:08] <luqui> but if sub say (*@_), then you can't

[18:09] <luqui> but if it's sub say ($a1, $a2, $a3, ...), then you can

[18:09] <luqui> (multi, that is)

[18:09] <theorbtwo> Overriding stringification would seem to make more sense in most cases, but for some.

[18:09] <luqui> ceratinly, but this is just an example

[18:09] <theorbtwo> Well, what's wrong with having *@_ be the invocant?

[18:09] <autrijus> problem is not even

[18:10] <autrijus> multi sub say (*@_) {}

[18:10] <autrijus> can be used in an invocant fashion

[18:10] <autrijus> theorbtwo: there's nothing wrong. pugs does that.

[18:10] <autrijus> it's just, uhm, against the spec.

[18:10] <theorbtwo> Oh.

[18:10] * theorbtwo steps backwards when volunteers to talk to p6l are asked for.

[18:10] <luqui> I'm just thinking that the concrete idea of "invocant" isn't buying us anything

[18:10] <autrijus> pugs currently tries to match invocantless multisubs when all invocantful subs did not match.

[18:11] <autrijus> which is my intuition

[18:11] <autrijus> but after further reading of Syns it seems that it's against the spec.

[18:11] <theorbtwo> Perhaps the case where there is one invocant, and it's the first scalar parameter, is just an optimization of the general case of multimethods?

[18:11] <luqui> the spec says that all your multis have to have the same number of invocants

[18:11] <luqui> forget quicksort, then

[18:11] <theorbtwo> That's how I always interpreted it, but I've never done a real detail reading.

[18:12] <autrijus> yeah. quicksort seems like a bad thing to forget.

[18:12] <PerlJam> luqui: multi sub say ($_) { ... }  multi sub say (*@_) { ... }   # there ya go!  Same number of invocants :-)

[18:12] <autrijus> and the fact that lwall did not catch the bug when I presented it on p6l (asking for slurpy ())

[18:12] <autrijus> PerlJam: nope. the first one has one

[18:12] <autrijus> the second one as none.

[18:13] <autrijus> slurpy are never invocants.

[18:13] <luqui> So I'm trying to re-work the dispatch mechanism as an arglist pattern matcher

[18:13] <autrijus> the zones are: invocants, positionals, nameds, slurpy.

[18:13] <luqui> Doing some wicked cool stuff with junctions

[18:13] <PerlJam> oh right, then the second one is multi sub say ([$_,*@_]) { ... }    #  oops! 

[18:13] <PerlJam> :-)

[18:13] <autrijus> at least since dec 04.

[18:13] <luqui> I'll blog on it later today

[18:14] <autrijus> mm.

[18:14] <autrijus> maybe add your blog to planetsix?

[18:14] <autrijus> http://www.luqui.org/blog/ right?

[18:14] <luqui> yeah

[18:15] <PerlJam> luqui: do you attend the cabal conference call each week?

[18:15] <luqui> yeah

[18:15] <PerlJam> This sounds like a good topic for this week's call.

[18:15] <luqui> sometimes...

[18:16] <luqui> I'll probably mention it and have an email waiting to go out on it

[18:16] <luqui> it's hard to talk about code itself

[18:16] <luqui> better to write about it

[18:18] <theorbtwo> I like the exponential units thing, BTW.

[18:18] <luqui> that was just wacky, I had to say something

[18:18] <luqui> thanks

[18:21] <ingy> hi luqui 

[18:21] <luqui> hi ingy

[18:21] <ingy> I just realized you were luqui 

[18:22] <luqui> lol, I think I know what you mean

[18:22] <ingy> -)

[18:24] <theorbtwo> Hmm, how do you write while (<>) {...} this week?  And is it implemented in pugs?

[18:24] <luqui> for =$*IN {...}

[18:25] <luqui> Was there a short form for that?

[18:25] <luqui> I don't remember

[18:25] <PerlJam> I thought that bare = or something was the <> equiv

[18:25] <PerlJam> for = {...}

[18:25] <luqui> I seem to remember something like that

[18:26] <autrijus> where is unary = in synopses?

[18:26] <luqui> on p6l

[18:26] <autrijus> in syns it's "for *$*IN { }"

[18:26] <luqui> It's pretty recent

[18:26] <autrijus> or "for *$FH"

[18:26] <autrijus> right.

[18:26] <autrijus> so is * invalid now?

[18:26] <luqui> I don't even know if Larry has decided to go with unary = as the <> equiv

[18:27] <PerlJam> autrijus: I get the impression that that's some syntax that's up-for-grabs at the moment.

[18:27] <luqui> but he pondered it pretty seriously

[18:27] <luqui> yeah, let's just hold off

[18:27] <PerlJam> or maybe it was for =<> {...} 

[18:27] <theorbtwo> http://dev.perl.org/perl6/synopsis/S04.html under "The for statement"

[18:27] <luqui> PerlJam: that is much more strongly reminiscent

[18:28] <PerlJam> yeah, that sounds righter.

[18:28] <luqui> yep, =<> indeed

[18:28] <PerlJam> Though the <> have radically changed meaning :-)

[18:28] <luqui> not since larry pondered that

[18:29] <PerlJam> I meant from perl5

[18:29] <luqui> actually I think the refactor was in the same message, or the same week at least

[18:29] <luqui> oh

[18:29] <luqui> yeah, it's like ={''}

[18:29] * luqui wonders if that works

[18:30] * luqui wonders if you can open/iterate in one nice call:

[18:30] <PerlJam> I'd add that to pugs if I were adding  (unfortunately, I haven't had enough time to learn as much as I'd like)

[18:30] <luqui> for =<file.foo> {...}

[18:30] <clkao> do we have a summary of implementation status of all primitives?

[18:30] <PerlJam> luqui: And then from the domino effect we get people asking if you can do   for =<*.foo *.bar> {...}

[18:31] <autrijus> clkao: builtin.pod

[18:31] <autrijus> src/builtins.pod

[18:31] <luqui> and we'd say no, you do:  for ={glob '*.foo', glob '*.bar'} {...}

[18:31] <PerlJam> btw, builtins.pod was copied from the perl6 repos?  Why not just use svn:externals?

[18:32] <autrijus> PerlJam: because we're using svk :)

[18:32] <autrijus> or at least, I am.

[18:32] <autrijus> and svk:merged is more handy than svn:externals to do mutual syncs.

[18:32] <PerlJam> I'll take your word for it :-)

[18:33] <autrijus> dev.perl.org's pugs and openfoundry pugs is synced bothways :)

[18:33] * PerlJam hasn't really looked at svk beyond the "carry whole repos around" idea 

[18:33] <autrijus> was one-way, but thanks to luqui, I verified that two-way is working.

[18:33] <autrijus> even with conflict resolution ;)

[18:33] <luqui> cool

[18:35] <luqui> ack, my keyboard appears to be russian

[18:35] <luqui> except here in putty

[18:36] <autrijus> new keyboard or new os?

[18:36] <luqui> using a computer at school

[18:36] <luqui> something happened

[18:37] <theorbtwo> .oO(In soviet russia, keyboards type you!)

[18:37] * luqui reads about the more theoretical aspect of monads so he can try to integrate them with his new model

[18:37] <luqui> haha

[18:41] <autrijus> :)

[18:41] <autrijus> luqui: so, lwall threatened to learn haskell. try to inflict it on him during confcall? :)

[18:41] <autrijus> I think it will help the "regularity" phase of perl6 design :)

[18:41] <luqui> definitely

[18:42] <luqui> !!

[18:42] <luqui> I think my new proposals will go over much better after he learns haskell, too

[18:42] <metaperl6> I have finished with yaht (pretty much) and have decided to understand Junc.hs and want to write up a pod document on what I learn. ~dist/docs is the place. what should I name the file

[18:42] <metaperl6> I presume you dont want lines and lines of comments within the Haskell code. Which I'm sure reads cleanly for an experiened haskeller

[18:42] <luqui> (one of the fundamental assumptions in my object model is obvious in haskell)

[18:43] <autrijus> metaperl6: Junc.pod is fine.

[18:43] <autrijus> or better, docs/src/Junc.pod.

[18:43] <metaperl6> ok

[18:44] <nnunley> Wee.  p6l analysis of my send+more=money implementation.

[18:45] <autrijus> nnunley: yeah. which led me to not ship it with 6.0.9 :)

[18:46] <autrijus> hope that's okay with you

[18:46] <luqui> natural monadic operations in perl will correspond rougly to overloading the semicolon operator

[18:47] <luqui> yay for macros!

[18:47] <autrijus> uh.

[18:47] <autrijus> you'll also have to overload destructive assignment.

[18:48] <autrijus> be back in a bit.

[18:49] <luqui> be back tomorrow

[18:50] <nnunley> autrijus: No offense taken.  I commited in order to find out what the correct implementation would be.

[18:56] <Coke_> wow. could fink's haskell have more dependencies?

[18:57] <ingy> Coke_: do a binary install of ghc

[18:57] <ingy> it is painless

[18:57] <Coke_> how?

[18:57] <ingy> download the .dmg from the ghc site

[18:57] <Coke_> ah, htought you meant through fink. =-)

[18:59] <Coke_> (gah, 30MB. =-)

[19:18] <Coke_> Note pugs/README mentions C<cpansign>, which I don't seem to have.

[19:18] <Coke_> (hurm. it does say optional, I suppose that's sufficient. =-)

[19:19] <clkao> it's in module::signature

[19:20] <Coke_> note that the referenced "SIGNATURE" is actually empty.

[19:21] <integral> the one in svn, or the one is a dist tarball?

[19:21] <Coke_> svn.

[19:22] <integral> well that should be empty.  The signature is for a distributed tarball

[19:22] <Coke_> Perhaps instead of being empty, it can have the text, "This file left blank intentionally". =-)

[19:22] <integral> heh

[19:23] <Coke_> huh. tests seem veeeery fast.

[19:25] <Coke_> I have test failures in svn-current.

[19:25] <Coke_> t/S03.t                    7    2  28.57%  3 5

[19:25] <PerlJam> failure is always fast :)

[19:25] <wolverian> timing out is not!

[19:26] <malaire> btw, the chat-log for this channel seems to break many perl-examples by thinking they contain email-addresses which should be hidden. Is there any way to fix this?

[19:27] <autrijus> a huge set of changes is about to land.

[19:27] <malaire> Reading logs is a bit hard when 50% of perl-codes has '[email@hidden.address]' in it...

[19:27] <autrijus> verily!

[19:27] <pjcj> feb owns the logger

[19:27] <autrijus> maybe beginning @ can be exepmted.

[19:27] <autrijus> btw, S03.t should be folded info 03operator.t.

[19:27] <autrijus> which I did.

[19:28] <autrijus> the t\0*.t are for the numbered synopses.

[19:28] <autrijus> also, our use of CR/CRLF was not consistent

[19:28] <autrijus> so I fixed it too.

[19:29] <autrijus> still committing...

[19:33] <autrijus> still going...

[19:33] <autrijus> hm. I may not have the time/bandwidth to sync up to svn.perl.org tonight, then.

[19:33] <ingy> autrijus: when will you write my kwid parsing starter kit

[19:34] <autrijus> ingy: tomorrow once I wake up, I think.

[19:34] <autrijus> be sure to ping me.

[19:34] <ingy> ok...

[19:34] <Khisanth> autrijus: you actually sleep? :)

[19:34] <autrijus> ingy: it will also help if you write some tests.

[19:34] <ingy> ok

[19:34] <autrijus> i.e. corner cases

[19:34] <ingy> yeah

[19:34] <autrijus> that can be fed to parser to ensure it does not break.

[19:34] <ingy> don't do it all :P

[19:34] <malaire> Should all tests pass now? I get 2 failures with 341 (both in t/S03)

[19:35] * ingy is reading the parsec manual

[19:35] <autrijus> you need 342.

[19:35] <autrijus> which all passes.

[19:35] <autrijus> and is much cleaner to boot.

[19:36] <ingy> you have to boot it?

[19:36] <ingy> :P

[19:36] <autrijus> ;)

[19:36] <ingy> you know too much english

[19:37] <ingy> maybe I can take lessons during yapc :p

[19:37] <autrijus> heh :p

[19:37] <autrijus> sure.

[19:39] <autrijus> now I sleep :)

[19:39] * autrijus waves &

[19:43] <Coke_> just svn updated and re-conf,make,test ... 100% pass.

[19:44] <PerlJam> yeah, but have you looked to see if he cheated yet?  ;-)

[19:45] <malaire> yep, I got 100% too

[19:56] <metaperl6> so

[19:56] <metaperl6> is the other svc admin here? I need my openfoundry account activated

[19:58] <ingy> hcchien: ping

[19:59] <ingy> metaperl6: I think it would be hcchien 

[19:59] <ingy> and I think he would be sleeping... or insane

[19:59] <metaperl6> hcchien, could you authorize me for commits? I have something I want to commit

[19:59] <ingy> metaperl6: you could mail a patch too

[20:00] <metaperl6> its a new file

[20:00] <metaperl6> intermediate commit of my pod on Junc.hs

[20:00] <metaperl6> does autrijus/hcchien sleep 4 or 8 hours? :)

[20:00] <ingy> in pod or kwid?

[20:00] <ingy> ;)

[20:00] <metaperl6> well, no worry, I won't lose it by tomorrow. It is in pod

[20:00] <Steve_p> diff -u /dev/null $filename

[20:01] <ingy> metaperl6: have you looked at perlkwid yet?

[20:01] <metaperl6> no... I dont know what that is.

[20:01] * ingy needs to write pod2kwid

[20:01] *** edgewalk1r is now known as edgewalker

[20:01] <ingy> pugs/lib/Perl6/lib/perlkwid.kwid

[20:02] <Squall`> wow, i thought perl6 was just an idea, dos the topic suggest that there's actually a usuable version of it out?

[20:03] <ingy> yes

[20:03] <metaperl6> kwid would be a big improvement if verbatim paragraphs could be specified in some way like {{{ }}}

[20:03] <ingy> Squall`: install ghc and Perl6::Pugs

[20:03] <metaperl6> or =for verbatim =cut

[20:03] <Squall`> ok

[20:03] <ingy> metaperl6: 

[20:04] <ingy> .verbatim

[20:04] <ingy> ...

[20:04] <ingy> .verbatim.

[20:04] <edgewalker> http://www.kwiki.org/ 403?

[20:04] <metaperl6> perlkwid.kwid did not say that under verbatim paragraphs

[20:04] <metaperl6> which is why I made my comment

[20:05] <ingy> metaperl6: I know. it would be an easy kwid extension tough

[20:05] <ingy> though

[20:05] <ingy> and useful

[20:05] <metaperl6> well I'm going to lunch... yes very useful

[20:05] * metaperl6 slips out the door

[20:12] <nnunley> Hrm.  Have I missed the documentation on the accessors for Junctions?  Junc.states seems to be something promised.

[20:13] <ingy> hi nnunley 

[20:13] <nnunley> ingy: Hey, ingy.  How goes?

[20:13] <ingy> nnunley: good. do you ever get out to Seattle?

[20:14] <nnunley> ingy:  Pretty rarely, these days.

[20:14] <nnunley> ingy:  Last time I was there was 2000, I think.  When the national poetry slam was there.

[20:14] <ingy> you are always welcome to stay a spell at our place

[20:14] * nnunley grins.

[20:15] <ingy> are you trekking to oscon?

[20:15] <nnunley> Danke.  Once I hit the ground in London, you're welcome to stay with us, too.

[20:15] <ingy> nnunley: oh right...

[20:15] <nnunley> Hadn't planned on it yet, but I think it might be in the budget.

[20:15] <ingy> cool

[20:16] <ingy> I forgot about the London thingy

[20:17] <nnunley> Easy to forget.   I've been in transitional state for a rather long time.  A bit like a junction. :)

[20:17] <clkao> lol

[20:17] <ingy> like schwern

[20:17] <ingy> hi clkao 

[20:17] <nnunley> nnunley = one(Pittsburgh|London)

[20:17] <ingy> clkao: are you still depressed?

[20:18] <clkao> i'm tired. it's 4am

[20:18] <nnunley> Snow's really coming down here.

[20:18] <nnunley> clkao: Sleep good.

[20:18] <ingy> clkao: I read that thing that made you depressed. 

[20:18] <nnunley> Insomia bad.

[20:18] <ingy> I don't think it was that bad

[20:18] <nnunley> s/som/somn/

[20:18] <ingy> svk is still rough, but it is genuinely useful

[20:19] <ingy> so keep on keeping on with it

[20:19] <clkao> ingy: no it wasn't, it was just a late-night boring whining

[20:19] <ingy> but we all know svk sucks right?

[20:19] <clkao> ya. terribly

[20:19] <ingy> at least it sucks less than yaml

[20:20] <clkao> and i got two thank-you mails today. how sickful. why don't they complain?

[20:22] <theorbtwo> Anybody know if Autjirus is going to speak at YAPC::NA?

[20:24] <clkao> i heard that he wants to go estonia around that time. 

[20:27] <Steve_p> theorbtwo, official submissions are still open for YAPC::NA

[20:43] <ingy> I proposed to fill in for autrijus at oscon

[20:43] * theorbtwo .sleep();

[20:45] <ingy> theorbtwo: does that put the current topic to sleep?

[20:45] <stevan> no only orbtwo because he was the invocant

[20:45] <ingy> hmmm

[20:45] <stevan> sleep ($obrtwo:) {}

[20:46] *** ingy is now known as theobratwo

[20:46] <theobratwo> hi obra

[20:46] *** theobratwo is now known as ingy

[20:49] <ingy> hi qmole 

[20:49] <qmole> hey

[20:50] <ingy> new to here?

[20:50] <qmole> yeah

[20:51] <ingy> do you use perl5?

[20:51] <qmole> i do

[20:51] <ingy> you can use perl6 now if you want

[20:52] <ingy> it's easy enough to install

[20:52] <ingy> grab ghc and Perl6::Pugs from cpan

[20:52] * PerlJam finding that writing perl6 code that actually runs is exhilarating

[20:53] <PerlJam> except when pugs can't parse what should be legal perl6.  Then it's mildly annoying until pugs is patched  ;-)

[20:53] <qmole> i'm doing so

[20:53] <ingy> cool

[20:53] <qmole> second attempt though

[20:53] <ingy> you can also use svn to get the latest code which is being written in real time :)

[20:58] <Steve_p> PerlJam, I know.  I'm chomping at the bit for objects :)

[20:58] <PerlJam> Steve_p: start implementing them then!   :-)

[20:59] <PerlJam> I'm wrapping my head (slowly) around haskell and parsec so that I can get to perl6 rules at some point.

[20:59] <PerlJam> I fear though, that others will have to pave that way.

[21:00] <Steve_p> PerlJam, I need to get a handle on Haskell first :)

[21:00] <qmole> heh

[21:00] <PerlJam> Let's see ... if I cut out one(family,sleep,consulting,work) I could get more pugs stuff done and learn more haskell.

[21:00] <qmole> finally, a motive to learn haskell

[21:01] <PerlJam> I really wish I could cut out consulting.  Perhaps I can forego sleep?

[21:01] <Khisanth> PerlJam: I vote for sleep

[21:02] <buu>  autark-jp !

[21:02] * ingy invents Kwid bytecode

[21:02] <PerlJam> Khisanth: the only trick there is that my wife wants me to go to bed when she goes to bed.  If I lay down too long (waiting for her to fall asleep) I'll fall asleep too.

[21:02] <buu> ingy: You freak

[21:02] <buu> ingy: Actually I had a question about kwid

[21:02] <Khisanth> hmm

[21:02] <buu> How is something like

[21:02] <buu> .list

[21:02] <buu> -foo

[21:02] <buu> bar

[21:02] <ingy> buu: necessary for defining kwid tests. and quite useful beyond that

[21:02] <buu> -baz

[21:02] <buu> .list.

[21:03] <buu> Supposed to render?

[21:03] <Khisanth> s/wife/android/ :P

[21:03] <ingy> first off, it is:

[21:03] <PerlJam> I guess I could set the alarm and wake up 2 hours earlier or something and get my haskell time then.

[21:03] <ingy> - foo

[21:03] <Khisanth> or maybe s/android/cyborg/

[21:03] <buu> Oh, that makes a difference?

[21:03] <Khisanth> PerlJam: do you drive to work?

[21:03] <PerlJam> Khisanth: I do.

[21:03] <Khisanth> can you take the bus/train instead/

[21:03] <Khisanth> ?

[21:04] <PerlJam> I could but it would eat up an inordinate amount of my day.

[21:04] <ingy> but it would render same as pod's: =over\=item foo\bar\=item baz\=back\

[21:04] <buu> PerlJam: The idea is to do stuff on the train I think

[21:05] <buu> ingy: Well, yeah, I thought so, but how is *that* supposed to render? And have you actually written a kwid parser?

[21:05] <Khisanth> PerlJam: cut out food! :P

[21:05] <ingy> buu: .list is a direct translation of =over

[21:05] <PerlJam> buu: I don't know about you, but I have trouble focusing as it is without *more* things to distract me  :)

[21:05] <ingy> buu: see Pod::Simple :P

[21:05] <buu> PerlJam: Er, focusing on what?

[21:05] <Khisanth> PerlJam: learn haskell and lose weight at the same time

[21:05] <PerlJam> ingy: you like nroff and troff don't you?

[21:05] <webmind> uhm.. hi

[21:05] <ingy> buu: I'm working on a parsec parser

[21:05] <webmind> can I ask perl6/pugs questions here or ?

[21:06] <PerlJam> webmind: this would be the place!

[21:06] <webmind> good

[21:06] <buu> webmind: No no, you want #php

[21:06] <webmind> buu, :)

[21:06] <ingy> PerlJam: I need to be able to support all Pod, if there is going to be a migration

[21:07] <webmind> I've installed pugs.. and was playing with it.. but when I do something like: 'for(0..1) { print "$_\n"; }' it prints '$_' ten times..

[21:07] <PerlJam> ingy: just like the perl6 parser is going to support perl5?  ;)

[21:07] <webmind> I wondered if that is correct.. and how it should be if it is :)

[21:07] <ingy> PerlJam: quite unlike that :P

[21:07] <Khisanth> webmind: try a newer pugs :)

[21:08] <webmind> Khisanth, uhm.. this one is from friday out of cpan ?

[21:08] <ingy> webmind: get the code from svn 

[21:08] <PerlJam> webmind: friday?  That's *ancient* 

[21:08] <Khisanth> webmind: it prints 0\n1 here

[21:08] <buu> heh

[21:08] <webmind> PerlJam, it's when I was introcuded to  it

[21:08] <Khisanth> friday is indeed ancient if you are talking about  pugs :)

[21:08] <ingy> webmind: and write a cron to svn up every minute ;)

[21:08] <Khisanth> webmind: there is almost a release every day :P

[21:08] <webmind> damn..

[21:08] <Khisanth> webmind: which version do you have?

[21:09] <webmind> well.. I guess it is still a bit new use

[21:09] <webmind> yes

[21:09] <webmind> 6.0.8 ?

[21:09] <PerlJam> Friday probably had a revision number < 200

[21:09] <buu> webmind: 6.0.9

[21:10] <Khisanth> webmind: works correctly in 6.0.9

[21:10] <Khisanth> where is the bug tracker for pugs?

[21:10] <webmind> I'll try and update :)

[21:11] <webmind> is cpan updated regularly ?

[21:11] <webmind> hmm

[21:11] <webmind> apearently not...

[21:11] <buu> For some value of regular

[21:12] <Khisanth> it is on CPAN your mirror may not have updated yet

[21:12] <PerlJam> webmind: yes, it's update regularly (for some value of regular as buu says) but supposedly there will be a pugs release each week.

[21:12] <webmind> since cpan still hosts 60.8

[21:12] <webmind> 6.0.8

[21:13] <buu> heh

[21:13] <buu> buumakefile

[21:13] <Khisanth> http://search.cpan.org/~autrijus/Perl6-Pugs-6.0.9/ no it doesn't :p

[21:13] <Steve_p> webmind, you should be able to browse ftp://pause.perl.org/incoming

[21:14] <Khisanth> PerlJam: what are you using for learning haskell?

[21:14] <buu> Latest is r345?

[21:14] <Steve_p> buu, probably 'round there

[21:14] <webmind> thnx

[21:14] <Steve_p> It was around 300 on Saturday morning

[21:14] <buu> Just making sure.

[21:14] <PerlJam> Khisanth: I've just been using the stuff from haskell.org

[21:14] <buu> I did svn up and remade, but I've had problems making properly.

[21:15] <Steve_p> buu, nopaste?

[21:15] <buu> Steve_p: Er, sorry, what?

[21:15] <Khisanth> Version Installed              6.0.5

[21:15] <Khisanth> Version on CPAN                6.0

[21:15] <Khisanth> hmm that seems a bit odd

[21:16] <stevan> buu: what revsion?

[21:16] <nnunley> Khisanth:  The YaHT is one of the better haskell tutorials.  http://www.isi.edu/~hdaume/htut/

[21:16] <buu> stevan: any

[21:16] <Steve_p> buu, http://paste.husk.org . Enter your errors you are seeing there.

[21:16] <PerlJam> nnunley: It's fairly good but there are a few gaps in the text that are slightly annoying.

[21:16] <buu> Steve_p: one sec.

[21:17] <webmind> and.. yay it works with 6.0.9

[21:17] <buu> Wow, I just calld the Dentist's office and got a modem

[21:17] <buu> Steve_p: Anyways, it's a nmake error

[21:18] <Steve_p> heh, there've been a few

[21:18] <nnunley> PerlJam:  True.

[21:19] <nnunley> They all can be a little rough, actually.

[21:20] <buu> NMAKE : fatal error U1045: spawn failed : Invalid argument

[21:20] <buu> Yay nmake!

[21:20] <Steve_p> log?

[21:20] <Steve_p> Crap!  No infobot!

[21:21] <buu> heh

[21:21] <buu> I'm pretty sure my nmake is just broke though, or something

[21:21] <Steve_p> Oh, that was you earlier 

[21:22] <buu> Yeah

[21:22] <buu> I wrote my own make file though

[21:22] <buu> It looks like

[21:22] <buu> perl Makefile.PL -version; ghc --stuff main.hs

[21:28] <buu> ingy: Are you doing anything with the documentation?

[21:32] <Steve_p> buu, http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/lib/Perl6/lib/perlkwid.kwid

[21:32] <crysflame> .

[21:32] <buu> Steve_p: What about it?

[21:32] <Steve_p> That's what ingy is doing to the documentation :)

[21:32] <buu> heh

[21:33] <buu> Point taken

[21:33] <ingy> :)

[21:33] <buu> I grepped the perl6-documentation mailing list,found like 4 actual pod documents totalling 300 lines

[21:33] <Steve_p> the pod is dead!  long live the kwid!

[21:33] <ingy> metaperl6: I added .verbatim

[21:33] <metaperl6> oh wonderful

[21:34] * metaperl6 svn update and looks at perlkwiki.kiw... or whatever it's named

[21:34] <Steve_p> heh

[21:35] <ingy> I was thinking that an optional ending marker could be passed to .verbatim

[21:35] <Steve_p> yeah tbone-metaperl-whatever :)

[21:35] <ingy> .verbatim ^%^*&%

[21:35] <ingy> but I'

[21:35] <ingy> but I'm holding off for now

[21:35] <buu> I was working on a perl parser for it

[21:35] <metaperl6> does a file document its usage ingy? I just did svn update

[21:35] <buu> metaperl6: Pssh, documentation.

[21:36] <ingy> but I'm holding off for now

[21:36] * metaperl6 returns to documenting Junc.hs

[21:36] <ingy> crap ...

[21:36] <metaperl6> in plain ol' pod

[21:36] <ingy> one sec

[21:36] <buu> Yay, documentation++

[21:36] *** Norman is now known as nnunley

[21:36] <ingy> metaperl6: try again

[21:37] <webmind> hmm

[21:37] <webmind> 'my @bar = @bla - 2;'

[21:37] <webmind> that's legal code in perl6 right ?

[21:37] <buu> Eww, unicode =[

[21:37] <integral> hmm, that didn't render here

[21:38] <metaperl6> yes, the docs were there but I am not sure how to bracket the verbatim... I guess a blank line ends the verbatim paragraph?

[21:38] *** edgewalk1r is now known as edgewalker

[21:38] <ingy> buu: you were writing a kwid parser?

[21:38] <buu> ingy: Yeah

[21:38] <webmind> buu, how are you going to use those operators without unicode ?

[21:38] <ingy> cool, in what language?

[21:38] <buu> webmind: They have ascii equivalents.

[21:38] <buu> ingy: Perl!

[21:38] <ingy> 5 or 6

[21:38] <buu> 5

[21:38] <buu> . o O ( Just kidding, it's actually in brainfuck! )

[21:38] <ingy> that would be cool

[21:39] <webmind> buu, hmm, well 'my @bar = @bla >>-<< 2;' isn't working either 

[21:39] <nnunley> webmind:  You probably want my @bar = @bla >>-<< 2;

[21:39] <integral> oh, that reminds me of something I asked a day or so ago;  how do you do IO in p6?

[21:39] <nnunley> webmind: Pugs doesn't have hyperoperators yet.

[21:39] <webmind> ah.. darn

[21:39] <integral> the a/e/s say that filehandles are now iterators, but I've only seen for *$IN -> $a { } as an example of how to use them

[21:39] <ingy> buu: I'm sketching out a kwid bytecode

[21:39] <crysflame> >>-<< ?!

[21:39] <ingy> pod could parse to the same bytecode

[21:40] <nnunley> crysflame: vector subtraction.

[21:40] <buu> ingy: Sounds entertaining.

[21:40] <crysflame> i..

[21:40] <webmind> crysflame, in my example: subtract 2 from all values in @bla

[21:40] <crysflame> promptly wonder if it'll support the latin1 >>

[21:40] <crysflame> argh i hate me

[21:40] <ingy> buu: it is how I'll write kwid tests

[21:40] <ingy> which you can use

[21:40] <buu> ingy: Heh, I looked at pod2html, it renders that .list. construct as <dl> <dt> </dt> <dd></dd> </dl> I believe.

[21:40] <buu> Tests are cool.

[21:41] <webmind> pugs doesn't seem to like junctions either :)

[21:41] <nnunley> crysflame: The unicode version of >> (?) works, too.

[21:42] <integral> +

[21:42] <nnunley> webmind: It does like junctions fine.  :)  Mostly.

[21:42] <nnunley> webmind: What are you trying to do with them?

[21:42] <webmind> nnunley, something bad I think.. 'my $foo = 0|1|2; print $foo;'

[21:43] <nnunley> webmind: Can?t directly print a junction.

[21:43] <webmind> ok

[21:43] <ingy> buu: yeah I think that is messed up

[21:43] <buu> ingy: Oh, why?

[21:43] <webmind> kinda make sense

[21:43] <integral> so some types just won't have stringifications?

[21:43] <nnunley> Which is part of my broken sendmoremoney.p6 example.

[21:43] <ingy> buu: I would think it would use <li>

[21:44] <ingy> but whatever

[21:44] <nnunley> Err, part of why my sendmoremoney.p6 example is broken.

[21:44] <ingy> it is only one formatter of pod to html

[21:44] <nnunley> integral: Pretty much.  I think there?s supposed to be a Junction.states method to reveal what states are still possible in a junction.

[21:44] <buu> ingy: Well yeah, but how does <li> work with the text paragraph?

[21:45] <integral> that'll be fun :-)   poor newbies getting exceptions when printing things ;-)   Enough people moan about undef warnings

[21:45] <buu> (undef warnings)--

[21:46] <nnunley> integral:  I guess it?s because print $foo; should output 3 times (0\n1\n2\)

[21:46] <integral> yeah, which makes junctions very, very different from other types

[21:46] <buu> nnunley: What the heck are you generating instead of a single quote?

[21:46] <integral> but that thread's been done to death :-(

[21:46] <nnunley> buu:  Bad things, mikey.

[21:46] <buu> =[

[21:47] <nnunley> There we go.  I was in the wrong character group.

[21:48] <buu> Hurray!

[21:48] <nnunley> buu:  I take it your irc client doesn't support unicode?

[21:48] <buu> nnunley: Guess not. Blame debian.

[21:48] <integral> nnunley: was that utf-8 you were using?   I just got a ?

[21:49] <nnunley> integral: That was supposedly utf-8.

[21:49] <crysflame> nice

[21:49] <integral> hmm

[21:49] <crysflame> can you temporarily evaluate a junction without permanently affecting that which you are evaluating?

[21:50] <crysflame> it looked exactly like latin 1 preceded by a utf-8 market

[21:50] <nnunley> crysflame: Heh.  Great.

[21:51] <buu> Hrm. TokeParser++

[21:51] <nnunley> crysflame:  You mean, narrow it?  Not sure.

[21:52] <crysflame> nnunley: "narrow it"?

[21:52] <crysflame> is that code speak for what i said?

[21:52] <crysflame> er, formal speak

[21:52] <integral> hmm, are junctions like the list monad in Haskell?

[21:52] <nnunley> crysflame: Nah, I mean, narrow down the number of states...  It's semi-formal.  No suit required.

[21:52] <crysflame> given my $foo : readonly = (0|1|2); # can i evaluate $foo repeatedly, for different results?

[21:52] <nnunley> crysflame: Yeap.

[21:53] <crysflame> okay, cool

[21:53] <integral> hmm, probably not. rhm

[21:53] <crysflame> so if i don't mark it readonly does it get permanently evaluated after the first time?

[21:53] <nnunley> I think it evaluates each time it's used, actually, whether it's readonly or not.

[21:53] <crysflame> cool, so the original isn't collapsed

[21:54] <crysflame> is there a .collapse() for doing so?

[21:54] <crysflame> or just $foo = $foo; # collapses

[21:54] <nnunley> Only time it stays collapsed is when its chained together... as far as I know.

[21:54] <nnunley> If I know how to collapse state, I'd finish sendmoremoney.p6 properly. :)

[21:54] <crysflame> nnunley: stringify it!

[21:54] * crysflame &

[21:55] <integral> t

[21:55] <nnunley> You mean, "$foo" where foo is the junction?

[21:58] <ingy> buu: I think you can put almost anything in <li>

[21:58] <buu> ingy: I suppose, but what would you put?

[21:58] <ingy> the stuff until the next item

[21:58] <buu> So:

[21:58] <buu> .list

[21:58] <buu> - foo

[21:58] <buu> bar

[21:59] <buu> .list.

[21:59] <buu> Would render as: <ul> <li> foo bar </li > </ul> ?

[21:59] <ingy> buu: see http://dev.perl.org/perl6/synopsis/S02.html

[21:59] <ingy> I'm sure it was written in pod

[22:00] <ingy> but it uses a different formatter

[22:00] <ingy> and uses <li>

[22:00] <integral> Combust

[22:00] <ingy> hmm

[22:01] <ingy> it puts stuff after the </li>

[22:01] <buu> Oh good.

[22:01] <ingy> but I'm not sure that is necessary

[22:01] <buu> Isn't that invalid markup?

[22:01] <ingy> I don't think so

[22:02] <buu> I'm pretty sure it is

[22:02] <buu> It's not valid HTML 4.01 transitional

[22:03] <ingy> buu: to correctly nest in html, you do <ul><li><ul><li></li></ul></li></ul>

[22:03] <wolverian> xhtml1.1 all the way.

[22:03] <buu> ingy: Right, is that the correct output?

[22:03] <ingy> the li contains the sub ul

[22:04] <buu> yeah

[22:04] <buu> That seems incorrect though, now you have two things that produce lists

[22:04] <ingy> I'll check, but the point is that parsing and formatting need to be separate

[22:04] <buu> Actual list formatters and text blocks 

[22:04] <buu> Well, yeah, this was related to my parsing output

[22:05] <ingy> right

[22:06] <buu> I suppose I'll just produce a list_item_start, text, list_item_end, text, text, list_item_Start

[22:06] <buu> Or something similar.

[22:12] <mugwump> ingy: that's what I thought, too ... but I think this is more correct;

[22:12] <mugwump> <ul> <li></li> <ul><li></li></ul> <li></li> </ul>

[22:12] <ingy> buu: the bytecode is a formalized and compact version of that

[22:13] <buu> mugwump: Er, are you sure?

[22:13] <ingy> mugwump: that is invalid xhtml 

[22:13] <buu> Yeah I thought so

[22:13] <ingy> afaik

[22:14] <ingy> Kwiki currently does that

[22:14] <ingy> and several people have informed me it is wrong

[22:14] <ingy> :)

[22:14] <ingy> the item *contains* the sublist

[22:15] <mugwump> I guess I should really look at the spec before piping up stuff like that

[22:15] <buu> ingy: Any idea what the bytecode looks like?

[22:15] <integral> *blink* Am I the only one who took this as the obvious way to do it?

[22:15] <buu> integral: It seems wrong to me =[

[22:18] <buu> integral: Only one thing should produce a <ul>, .list

[22:18] <ingy> integral: ?

[22:19] <integral> i was meaning the <li><ul/></li> in html

[22:19] <ingy> ah

[22:19] <ingy> buu: I'm working on the bytecode now

[22:20] <buu> Er, so should my parser try to output bytecode or what?

[22:20] <ingy> buu: do you have SubEthaEdit?

[22:21] <buu> Nope.

[22:21] <ingy> buu: tmtowtdi, but your parser should call event handlers that map to the bytecode

[22:21] <buu> Eww, event handlers =/

[22:22] <ingy> event handlers don't have to be  icky

[22:22] <ingy> for instance

[22:22] <ingy> you could make it so that a program hands your parser the name of a class that implements the event handlers

[22:23] <buu> ...

[22:23] <ingy> so registration is easy

[22:23] <ingy> or maybe you want a pull parser

[22:23] <buu> Yes, yes I do.

[22:24] * PerlJam pulls buu's pants down

[22:24] <ingy> why? (just wondering)

[22:24] * buu brutally beats PerlJam 

[22:24] <ingy> either way, you will have events that map to the bytecode

[22:25] <buu> ingy: It's my opinion that pullparsers make it easier to write code that actually uses them.

[22:25] <ingy> a bytecode formatter will be trivial, and used for testing your parser

[22:25] <ingy> buu: how so?

[22:25] * PerlJam enjoys the beating but wishes it were gorgeous female rather than buu doing the beating.

[22:26] <buu> ingy: Perhaps a slightly contrived example, but imagine you want to skip the first 20 events

[22:26] <buu> If you were using events, you'd have to have code in every single event sub that checks thenumber of events and such.

[22:26] <integral> don't you just want a DSL that maps your logic onto the underlying parser, either pull, or event based?

[22:26] <buu> integral: I banish you and your DSL's

[22:26] <buu> But if you are using a pullparser, you just call 'get_token' 20 times then do what ever you want.

[22:28] <buu> Maybe I'm just biased.

[22:28] <ingy> buu: true. you have to write your own dispatch loop though

[22:28] <ingy> a better example: imagine you want to prune a branch

[22:28] <buu> Yeah, but those typically aren't very onerous

[22:29] <buu> Yes?

[22:29] <PerlJam> buu: or you have a proxy "event object" that skips 20 tokens before it hands stuff off to the real event manager

[22:29] <PerlJam> er, s/manager/handler/

[22:29] <buu> PerlJam: Sounds overly complex and hard to write.

[22:29] <ingy> you get a start event for that branch and return a code or throw an exception to ignore the branch

[22:29] <PerlJam> buu: Actually, I was thinking it sounds almost monadic :-)

[22:30] <ingy> easier in a push parser :)

[22:30] <buu> while( $t = get_token ) { print unless $t->branch_id == $id }

[22:30] <buu> =p

[22:30] <integral> PerlJam: well ; is a lot like >>

[22:31] <PerlJam> buu: you just don't like event driven things.

[22:31] <PerlJam> buu: you like to be in control

[22:31] <buu> PerlJam: Probably.

[22:32] <integral> directly writing FSMs does suck though...

[22:32] <buu> (psychiatric evaluation through perl)++

[22:32] * buu beats integral to death with a TLA

[22:32] <ingy> buu: a pull parser is nice because it is trivial to convert to a push parser

[22:32] <integral> converting a push parser to a pull parser can be done with continuations

[22:33] <ingy> buu: you don't use a mac?

[22:33] <buu> ingy: Fraid not.

[22:34] <ingy> too bad. SEE is fun

[22:35] <PerlJam> ingy: fun, eh?  Are you using it for pugs development?  Do multiple editors come and go as you compose?

[22:36] <ingy> I was thinking of using it to help create the kwid bytecode spec

[22:36] <ingy> I used it recently to write an oscon tutorial proposal

[22:36] <ingy> it was great

[22:36] <buu> Hrm. I wrote a pod::pullparser type thing, and for the following code

[22:37] <buu> = head1 my header

[22:37] <buu> my paragraph

[22:37] <buu> I produced 6 tokens

[22:37] <buu> start header, text, end header, start textpara, text, end textpara;

[22:38] <ingy> buu: yep

[22:38] <buu> Seems a little wordy, but I'm not sure how else to do it

[22:38] <ingy> it will be like that, but more compact

[22:38] <buu> I would prefer to just produce a "header_token" containing the header text, but then what do I do about embedded formatting codes?

[22:39] <integral> return a header_token with an embedded token stream

[22:39] <buu> Er, so the user has to recurse in to it?

[22:39] <integral> of course.   Sounds nicely haskell/lispish

[22:39] <buu> =[

[22:40] <buu> Recursion always comes off so ugly though

[22:40] <ingy> >=1, ==my header, <=, >P, ==my paragraph\n, <P

[22:40] <buu> Gah

[22:40] <buu> ingy: What the hell.

[22:40] <PerlJam> buu: yeah! recursive quicksort is *so* ugly!  

[22:40] <ingy> :D

[22:40] <buu> PerlJam: Ok, in some cases it isn't, but I think it would be fore this case

[22:40] <ingy> buu: it is a bytecode

[22:41] <ingy> anyway, it can be open for comment

[22:41] <buu> It scares me.

[22:41] <buu> Anyways, what was the point for the bytecode again?

[22:41] <ingy> > == start, < == end

[22:42] <ingy> as a standard compact intermediate form

[22:42] <buu> We need one?

[22:42] <ingy> it is based off of YAML bytecode

[22:42] <ingy> it is great for testing

[22:42] <integral> data PodBlock = Header [PodInline] | Paragraph [PodInline]; data PodInline = Text | Bold PodInline; -- ...

[22:42] <integral> barely recursive at all

[22:42] <PerlJam> ingy: why don't you use the SOH, STX, ETX, EOT, etc. characters?  ;)

[22:43] *** feber is now known as feb

[22:43] <ingy> buu: btw, I am working on a parsec parser for kwid

[22:43] <buu> ingy: I remember.

[22:43] <ingy> cool

[22:43] <buu> integral: MY problem is escapes embedded in escapes =[

[22:43] * PerlJam really must get on the ball learning parsec

[22:43] <integral> buu: data PodInline = Escape PodInline;!

[22:44] <integral> actually you probably don't want to use the constructor in your code, but rather a function wrapper for it which does some eager normalisation

[22:44] <buu> Yeah..

[22:45] <feb> did someone here complain about @ signs in the logs ?

[22:45] <buu> I was thinking about that, but how do you tell the difference between f<b<foo>> and f<foo> b<foo>

[22:45] <buu> or rather

[22:45] <PerlJam> feb: someone earlier mentioned that they show up as email addresses (hidden) in the logs

[22:45] <buu> I was thinking about that, but how do you tell the difference between f<foo b<bar>> and f<foo> b<bar>

[22:46] <feb> yes, saw it. Just to mention that it's now improved

[22:46] <feb> all @ signs should come through except email addesses

[22:46] <integral> because one is Escape (Text "foo" : Bold (Text "bar" : []))) or something

[22:46] <PerlJam> feb: Where are the logs at?

[22:47] <feb> http://colabti.de/irclogger//irclogger_logs/perl6

[22:47] <buu> integral: Er, so what's the other?

[22:47] <ingy> {ffoo {bbarb}f}

[22:47] <feb> the topic gives an url too, btw

[22:47] <integral> buu: Escape (Text "foo" : []) : Bold (Text "bar" : []) or something

[22:47] <buu> recursion--

[22:48] * integral goes back to working

[22:49] * buu ponders

[22:49] <feb> good night

[22:50] * Steve_p is pleased to see so many fellow monks here

[22:50] <buu> heh

[22:50] <buu> Monks++

[22:51] * ingy is a dirty monk

[22:51] <buu> ingy: What do dirty monks do?

[22:51] <Steve_p> No underware under the robes

[22:52] <ingy> well I'm more of a wandering monk. I haven't been to the monastery much, and yeah, I freeball it

[22:52] <buu> Monastery is great.

[22:52] <ingy> but i have been in perlmonks since 2000

[22:54] <buu> Bah. I guess I'm going back to start and end tags.

[22:54] <ingy> ?

[22:55] <buu> start and end events.

[22:55] <buu> tokens, whatever.

[22:55] <buu> start header, text, start escape, text, end escape, end header;

[22:55] <ingy> instead of?

[22:55] <buu> Well, I would prefer a token that contained everything from start to end

[22:55] <ingy> that's an optimization

[22:56] <ingy> sounds premature

[22:56] <ingy> :p

[22:56] <buu> Um

[22:56] <buu> It's a ease of use optimization, those are never premature!

[22:56] <ingy> sure they are

[22:56] <buu> Bah

[22:56] <buu> This one isn't.

[22:57] <ingy> they why are you going back to start and end?

[22:57] <buu> hahaha

[22:57] <buu> ingy: Because I don't see a good way to deal with escape code thingies, which can be nested.

[22:57] <ingy> :)

[22:58] <buu> Hrm. Maybe I'll have a command token which contains a list of text / escape items

[22:58] <buu> and I can do start/end just for the escapes.

[22:59] <ingy> the bytecode will always have begin/end since you can generate those from the optimized view

[22:59] <buu> bah

[23:00] <buu> You can generate start/end from my optimized tokens!

[23:00] <ingy> that's what I said

[23:00] <buu> Yeah I know

[23:00] <buu> Time for cisco

[23:00] <ingy> so it will be easy to use the bytecode tests for you

[23:03] <ingy> hmm. I just realized that I am optimizing

[23:03] <ingy> I didn't even catch that.

[23:03] <buu> heh

[23:03] <buu> Optimization is good.

[23:03] <ingy> :P

[23:04] <buu> Especially premature, code twsting, mind bending optimization.

[23:06] <buu> Anyways, cisco time, I shall be back to mock your bytecode... soon.

[23:06] <ingy> cisco?

[23:07] <ingy> buu: look in t/kwid/readme when you return

[23:20] <stevan> r348 --- All tests successful, 1 subtest skipped. Files=51, Tests=768

[23:20] <stevan> :)

[23:30] <buu_> I return!

[23:32] <buu_> hi buu 

[23:32] <ingy> hi buu

[23:32] <ingy> hi ingy

[23:32] <buu_> heh

[23:32] <ingy> er

[23:32] <ingy> hi ingy_

[23:32] <ingy> almost done

[23:32] <buu_> Go wake up aujitrus

[23:34] <buu_> Hrm. I think I'll write my own query string parser.

[23:34] <crysflame> hum.

[23:35] <buu_> Anyone taken a look at p6-doc? I grepped it for emails containing pod and found about 4, aujitrus seemed to imply that they had actually produced some useful docs

[23:35] <buu_> Did I miss them in the archive or is he missinformed?

[23:37] <buu_> Did everyone die?

[23:39] * ingy rises from the dead

[23:39] <buu_> Good trick

[23:41] <buu_> Now answer!

[23:41] <ingy> hehe

[23:41] <ingy> dunno

[23:42] <buu_> =[

[23:42] <buu_> Because it looks like a stinking morass of failure to me

[23:46] <ingy> buu_: yo

[23:46] <ingy> buu_: could you review http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/t/kwid/readme for me

[23:47] <ingy> it's a first pass. I'm sure we can /optimize/ it :)

[23:48] <buu_> Yes!

[23:48] <buu_> Optimization++

[23:48] <ingy> food++

[23:49] <buu_> Er, is {``} special aside from the `` ?

[23:49] <ingy> I like the linear bytecode because Test.pm could give me a diff

[23:49] <ingy> which would be really nice

[23:50] <ingy> buu_: special?

[23:50] <buu_> ingy: Is {``} some kind of special formatting construct, or is just a `` surrounded by textual brackets?

[23:51] <ingy> {``} is the extended `` as {**} is the extended **

[23:51] <ingy> the cleaner forms are highly restricted

[23:51] <buu_> Oh

[23:51] <buu_> Apparently I didn't get that far in to perlkwid =]

[23:52] <buu_> Ok, in your byte code, for:

[23:52] <buu_> == sample

[23:52] <buu_> you generate:

[23:52] <buu_> >H2

[23:52] <buu_> =sample

[23:52] <buu_> <H

[23:52] <ingy> they must hug their args with whitespace before the biginning one and after the ending one

[23:52] <buu_> Why is sample preceded by a '=' ?

[23:52] <ingy> well kind of like that

[23:53] <ingy> `=` indicates the kind of line it is

[23:53] <ingy> in the bytecode

[23:53] <ingy> = for text lines

[23:53] <buu_> Ah

[23:53] <buu_> Oh hey

[23:53] <buu_> I should read the entire thing =]

[23:53] <ingy> yes

[23:54] <buu_> Reminds me of xml

[23:54] <ingy> we could do it in xml :P

[23:54] <buu_> =[

[23:54] <buu_> XML makes me weep inside.

[23:55] <ingy> the text lines are normalized, which means that the parser does the line folding and escaping, etc

[23:55] <buu_> Ok..

[23:55] <buu_> I think I understand that

[23:55] <buu_> What are .Formatted lines?

[23:56] <ingy> the bytecode uses \n to indicate newline

[23:56] <buu_> And why didn't you use a list for the bottom?

[23:56] <ingy> ?

[23:57] <ingy> feel free to refactor

[23:57] <buu_> heh

[23:57] <buu_> You never answered the .Formatted

[23:57] <ingy> . is for things like .foo\n...\n.foo.\n

[23:57] <buu_> But at the bottom, when you list the types of events, you just have a verbatim block that looks a lot like a list.

[23:57] <buu_> Er, not following

[23:58] <ingy> have you read perlkwid

[23:58] <ingy> there is a generic block syntax akin to =begin foo

[23:58] <ingy> .foo

[23:58] <ingy> ...

[23:58] <ingy> .foo.

[23:58] <ingy> .comment

[23:58] <ingy> ...

[23:58] <buu_> I thought those were lists

[23:58] <ingy> .comment.

[23:58] <ingy> .list

[23:58] <ingy> ...

[23:58] <ingy> .list.

[23:58] <ingy> .pod

[23:58] <ingy> ...

[23:59] <ingy> .pod.

[23:59] <ingy> etc

[23:59] <ingy> .html

[23:59] <ingy> .moinmoin

[23:59] <ingy> .yomama
