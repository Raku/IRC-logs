[00:01] <Juerd> Still, do you think it hasin any way to do with Perl?

[00:01] <Juerd> Or would it be coincidental?

[00:02] <wolverian> I _like_ to think that Perl is a language that suits people who have unconventional tendencies

[00:02] <wolverian> I'm not at all sure if it's true :)

[00:03] <wolverian> (well, actually, I am. but me being true doesn't make it any more true, if you get what I mean. this is what you get for being relativist.)

[00:03] <wolverian> er. s,me being true,me being sure, 

[00:03] <wolverian> I need to drink less mountain dew.

[00:03] <Juerd> hehe

[00:04] <Juerd> A year or so ago, my parents found my website and read it. I didn't especially mean to avoid using my real name there, but I did not use it anywhere.

[00:05] <Juerd> They asked me "Do you want us to call you Juerd?"

[00:05] <Juerd> I was very surprised "No, let's not go that far"

[00:05] <Juerd> Though sometimes I wonder why not.

[00:05] <wolverian> mm.

[00:05] <wolverian> what is your real real name?

[00:06] <Juerd> Jorrit J. Waalboer

[00:06] <Juerd> The J. stands for Jelle

[00:07] <wolverian> dutch names are nice. :)

[00:11] <Juerd> They're not Dutch

[00:11] <Juerd> They're Frisian

[00:11] <Juerd> So is Juerd

[00:11] <wolverian> oh, I'm sorry.

[00:11] <Juerd> I'm not Frisian though

[00:11] <Juerd> Neither are my parents

[00:11] <wolverian> ah. educated myself a bit over at wikipedia

[00:14] <Juerd> Good night

[00:15] <wolverian> good night.

[00:17] <kolibrie> seen nothingmuch

[00:17] <jabbot> kolibrie: nothingmuch was seen 2 hours 39 minutes 56 seconds ago

[00:46] <wolverian> I think I fell in love with ruby. (again)

[01:33] <svnbot6> r5131, Stevan++ | Perl6-MetaModel : Airport hacking; plane hacking; then some bus-back-to-home hacking; .... hmmm I think I need to install SVK tomorrow. Oh yeah, and I cleaned out the ::Class junk, changed the interface a bit to conform to the real Perl6 meta model (per AS12) added a test and started down the path to MetaRoles :)

[01:34] <putter> wolverian: any interest in working on a p6 implementation of ruby core?

[01:34] <mugwump> stevan: still in transit?

[01:36] <wolverian> putter: hmm. maybe. I don't have much tuits though.

[03:03] <nothingmuch> perl: "Easy things are easy, hard things are possible"

[03:03] <nothingmuch> haskell "

[03:03] <nothingmuch> haskell: "Hard things are easy, the impossible just happens"

[03:03] <nothingmuch> -- autrijus

[03:04] <nothingmuch> autrijus corrects: "hard things are easy, impossible things just happen"

[03:04] <nothingmuch> autrijus++

[03:05] <nothingmuch> i think i like the paraphrase "hard things are easy, the impossible just happenned" the most, since it's actually quoting, not paraphrasing GHC

[03:08] <wolverian> I think that in perl, the easy things are more convenient than in haskell, but I might be biased.

[03:09] <putter> wolverian: k.  my current thought is once namespaces work a bit more, to do a dump of the core with {...} bodies, which can be incrementally fleshed out.  tests, and core .rb files, can hopefully be, at least partially, automatically transliterated.

[03:10] <wolverian> putter: hm. I'm a bit hesitant about using perl6, yet, actually. I hate running into pugs's limitations.

[03:11] <autrijus> wolverian: sure, in haskell the easy things are incovenient ;)

[03:11] <wolverian> autrijus: heh. :)

[03:11] <autrijus> it's all about conservation of complexity

[03:12] <nothingmuch> since haskell defines less

[03:12] <nothingmuch> but that less is more reusable, and intercombinable

[03:12] <nothingmuch> is that a word?

[03:12] <wolverian> isn't combinable enough? :)

[03:12] <nothingmuch> the hard things are easy, because there are less details to take care of

[03:12] <nothingmuch> combinable with itself

[03:12] <nothingmuch> there are less special cases in the language def

[03:12] <nothingmuch> s/less/fewer/

[03:12] <wolverian> do you mean the syntax or semantics?

[03:13] <nothingmuch> semantics

[03:13] <nothingmuch> syntax is nothing

[03:13] <wolverian> right.

[03:13] <wolverian> what do you mean with special cases, then?

[03:13] <nothingmuch> autrijus has a wifi antenna on his head, so he does it need syntax

[03:13] <wolverian> I think I have an idea what you mean, but it's hazy

[03:13] <nothingmuch> every operator in haskell is a first class function

[03:13] <nothingmuch> autocurrying is a generic approach that gives you both emulation of multiple params

[03:14] <wolverian> chromatic steals karma!!!

[03:14] <nothingmuch> wolverian: you can do that too.

[03:14] <wolverian> yes, I know :)

[03:14] <nothingmuch> wolverian: anyway, my point is this: haskell is very simple

[03:14] <wolverian> forgive me, I've been up all night, waiting for the morning to come so I can go to the doctor.

[03:14] <nothingmuch> so simple that complex structures (like monads) are optimizable.

[03:15] <nothingmuch> and that many things are safe

[03:15] <autrijus> zzz &

[03:15] <nothingmuch> so you can do crazier combinations

[03:15] <nothingmuch> and things are sane

[03:15] <nothingmuch> he's lying

[03:15] <wolverian> nothingmuch: but it moves the complexity elsewhere.

[03:15] <nothingmuch> wolverian: but complexity scales down slightly by that transformation

[03:15] <nothingmuch> the curve of code complexity vs. problem complexity has a lower ratio

[03:16] <putter> 'night autrijus.

[03:18] <obra> evening lambdacamels

[03:18] <nothingmuch> hola obra

[03:18] <obra> how's canadia, nothingmuch 

[03:18] <obra> ?

[03:19] <nothingmuch> it's nice

[03:19] <putter> wolverian: re limitations, agreed.  a downside is drawing ruby community attention while a) oo pugs is still a work in progress, and b) grammars aren't up to doing ruby, so its "ruby-like p6", rather than a "p6 backend for ruby".

[03:20] <nothingmuch> obra: are you already home

[03:21] <nothingmuch> at home?

[03:21] <wolverian> putter: yes. that's why I'm hesitant. I'm thinking about it.

[03:21] <putter> upside is much of the grunge work of porting core could be done now, for some value of now, leaving, and clarifying, where things arent ready yet.

[03:23] <putter> I'm tempted to just keep ripper-based transliteration, a ruby grammar, and a p6 core, "simmering" but not checked in, until oo matures enough that all 4 are "almost within reach".  Ie, punt for now.

[03:28] <putter> wolverian: doctor?

[03:28] * putter hopes it's nothing too serious...

[03:29] <obra> nothingmuch: yes. drove 10 hours today

[03:29] <wolverian> putter: just a test for a suspected slight thyroid gland thingie.

[03:30] <wolverian> (sorry if that was too much information :)

[03:36] <QtPlatypus> Is there anyway of doing :d on a file?

[03:38] * wolverian stares at QtPlatypus 

[03:38] <wolverian> lick your nose on a file?

[03:39] <QtPlatypus> No dump the parse tree for this file (in pugs0

[03:39] <QtPlatypus> )

[03:39] <wolverian> oh.

[03:39] <wolverian> I dunno.

[03:41] <putter> ah, np, hope it goes well. (standard one-liner advice #001: have someone along to serve as a patient (you) advocate.  there is so much potential for... cruft/complications/etc, when there isnt a "project manager" along)

[03:47] <Daniel_Nee> Hi, Autrijus: If you hear me, could you please let me know where are you and when will you be back, thanks.

[03:49] <putter> 'night &

[04:09] <nothingmuch> Daniel_Nee: autrijus says he will be back in 72 hours

[04:09] <nothingmuch> he is still in toromnto

[04:10] * nothingmuch just wrote UNIVERSAL::isa

[04:10] <nothingmuch> (a module, not a function)

[04:10] <nothingmuch> =head1 NAME

[04:10] <nothingmuch> UNIVERSAL::isa - Hack around stupid module authors using UNIVERRSAL::isa as a

[04:10] <nothingmuch> function when they shouldn't.

[04:11] <wolverian> haha.

[04:11] <wolverian> what does it do?

[04:12] <nothingmuch> on the cpan shortly

[04:12] <nothingmuch> short answer:.

[04:12] <nothingmuch> replaces UNIVERSAL::isa with a version that does a check on the first argument

[04:12] <nothingmuch> if it is an object, and the object overrides 'isa', then a call to 'isa' as a method on the object is made

[04:12] <nothingmuch> in all other scenarios the original 'UNIVERSAL::isa' is goto'd

[04:13] <sili_> interesting.

[04:13] <wolverian> nice.

[04:13] <nothingmuch> i hope chromatic will make Test::MockObject use it

[04:14] <wolverian> can you make it output a warning like 'read perldoc -f eval' now and then randomly?

[04:14] <nothingmuch> eval?

[04:14] <nothingmuch> oh, like for eval { } ...?

[04:14] <wolverian> yeah.

[04:14] <nothingmuch> ah

[04:14] <nothingmuch> well, they can just 'use UNIVERSAL::isa qw/isa/'

[04:14] <nothingmuch> and then use it as a function

[04:14] <nothingmuch> it's still safe

[04:15] <wolverian> indirect object notation overrices?

[04:15] <wolverian> er. RIDES.

[04:15] <nothingmuch> btw, for fun regarding 'eval {}', read the source of pure perl Scalar::Util::bless and overload::StrVal

[04:15] <nothingmuch> uh, i doubt it

[04:16] <nothingmuch> if there is a symbol in the current package, it should be a function call

[04:16] <nothingmuch> (i think)

[04:16] <nothingmuch> it basically does a bless check for you

[04:16] <wolverian> right.

[04:16] <nothingmuch> so the function form is OK

[04:17] <wolverian> I just read it as 'use UNIVERSAL qw/isa/' and was confused

[04:17] <wolverian> sorry. :)

[04:17] <nothingmuch> ah

[04:17] <nothingmuch> that would also work

[04:17] <nothingmuch> as long as UNIVERSAL::isa (the module) was 'use'd beforehand

[04:17] <wolverian> why?

[04:34] <nothingmuch> uh, sorry

[04:34] <nothingmuch> i lost myself

[04:34] <nothingmuch> because UNIVERSAL::isa is overridden

[04:35] <nothingmuch> and the original is only stored in a lexical afterwords

[04:35] <nothingmuch> it is no longer available by name.

[04:35] <nothingmuch> i'm off to bed

[04:35] <nothingmuch> read the code, it is up on the cpan

[04:35] <nothingmuch> or actually 'it will be soon'

[05:41] <CLoCkWeRX> o/t question, re chip [sorry guys, you're probably getting it alot]... how big of an effect does this trouble in his life have upon the release cycle of perl 6?

[05:55] <gaal_> good morning

[05:57] <geoffb> . . . and good night

[05:57] * geoffb passes off the "awake" baton to gaal_ 

[05:57] * gaal_ will accept it in a few minutes, after making coffee :)

[06:20] * gaal_ wonders if pugscc is something autrijus can fix while asleep...

[06:33] <gaal_> who are all the people on ingy's slides? I recognize some...

[06:36] <wolverian> I'm a recluse, I wouldn't know. :/

[06:39] <gaal_> in http://yapc.kwiki.org/data-driven-testing/slide19.html - when does the http hit actually happen? when you say $block->url, or when you perform the like?

[06:39] <gaal_> (does like now accept a closure to be run?)

[06:41] <gaal_> hahahahahaa! the slides leading up to 26 are quite amusing

[06:41] <gaal_> ingy++

[06:42] <wolverian> yes.

[06:42] <wolverian> :)

[06:43] <wolverian> where does he get the like() sub from!!!

[06:43] <gaal_> his Test::Base, of course

[06:44] <wolverian> the CPAN version only has run_like()

[06:44] <wolverian> (or I'm blind)

[06:44] <gaal_> point

[06:45] <gaal_> hhhmmm, no, http://search.cpan.org/src/INGY/Test-Base-0.43/lib/Test/Base.pm and look at test_more_exports

[06:45] <wolverian> I'd say that needs documentation!

[06:45] <wolverian> s,!,, # too much caffeine

[06:45] <gaal_> looks like he's pulling the haskell reexport trick :)

[06:47] <wolverian> what is that? I'm completely missing the point of the BEGIN

[06:47] <gaal_> he imports things on the use line of Test::More

[06:47] <gaal_> so he needs @test_more_exports populated

[06:48] <gaal_> at *compile* time

[06:48] <gaal_> i didn't know you can pass an arrayref to T:M's import though!

[06:49] <wolverian> oh, he's using the array there. yeah.

[06:50] <gaal_> one place lexical scope results in awkward usage is when you want to preload data in a BEGIN block. i've never liked how that forces you to declare the var outside the block.

[06:50] <gaal_> i wonder if p6 will have something like our $OUTER::var :-)

[06:51] <wolverian> heh.

[06:51] <gaal_> not that that's much prettier!

[06:51] <wolverian> well, the fact that it works at all is somewhat mind-boggling.

[06:51] <wolverian> "look, I'm using this variable now, but I promise I'll declare it later!"

[06:51] <gaal_> oh? no, the declaration happened before

[06:51] <gaal_> look one line above the BEGIN block

[06:52] <gaal_> remember my is compile time too

[06:52] <wolverian> oh, I thought BEGIN is run before that happens

[06:52] <wolverian> yeah. okay. :)

[06:52] <wolverian> thanks for unconfusing me.

[06:52] <gaal_> if that like were to be placed after the BEGIN, you'd get a compilation error

[06:52] <gaal_> actually, that's part of what makes-perfect-sense-but-gives-awkward-usage:

[06:53] <gaal_> you can't just put your BEGIN block on the top of your code for everyone to see, you're forced to declare a bunch of stuff before it

[06:54] <wolverian> that's the same as how you have to declare your subs before using them if you don't like to sprinkle your code with useless parentheses

[06:54] <wolverian> (admittedly you don't have to _define_ them beforehand, but still..)

[06:55] <gaal_> in p5 i got to always using parens on sub calls because of that

[06:56] <wolverian> will p6 fix it? :)

[06:56] <gaal_> it's a little early to write a perl 6 style guide though :)

[06:56] <gaal_> well, there are no barewords in p6...

[06:56] <wolverian> exactly my thoughts

[07:00] <gaal_> oooof, how to Show a TVar in a reversible manner?

[15:09] <kolibrie> dreams of good things?

[15:24] <Limbic_Region> is this news to anyone besides me? http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=471746

[15:25] <sili> can't say i expected more

[15:29] <autrijus> lexer and parser needs to be one-pass; that's one of the main points in my hw2005 paper

[15:30] <autrijus> I don't think that's a problem really

[15:30] <autrijus> but if damian promised otherwise, it's (again) wishful thinking

[15:31] <autrijus> rehi, btw :)

[15:32] <kolibrie> the compiler and interpreter are still quite separate, correct?

[15:54] <stevan> I dont know about you guys, but sleep deprivation is hitting me like a brick

[15:55] <stevan> I am only just now realizing how little sleep I actually got over those 8+ days

[15:55] <autrijus> stevan: //hand

[15:55] <kolibrie> I did okay yesterday, but I'm having trouble today

[15:55] <autrijus> stevan: 21 days for me

[15:55] * autrijus is having trouble waking up

[15:55] <stevan> autrijus: you are young though, you will bounce back :)

[15:55] <autrijus> very true :)

[15:56] <kolibrie> stevan: hopefully we'll bounce back, too...

[15:56] <stevan> kolibrie: yes, but not without permanent damage, we are too old :P

[15:57] <stevan> autrijus: I realized for the first time the true value of SVK, when I wanted to commit, but was in the airport/plane/bus

[16:02] <autrijus> sure can

[16:02] <stevan> cool, I will do that then :)

[16:02] <nothingmuch> hola stevan 

[16:02] <stevan> guten tag nadda mucho

[16:03] <autrijus> stevan: http://rt.openfoundry.org/Foundry/Project/Download/Attachment/33814/23873/SVK-1.00-2.dmg

[16:03] <nothingmuch> stevan: try again

[16:03] <nothingmuch> it wasn't working for me a few times, and then it started

[16:03] <autrijus> stevan: that's .dmg, use it :)

[16:03] <stevan> autrijus++ # making my life much easier :)

[16:03] <stevan> nadda mucho

[16:03] <stevan> that work?

[16:04] <nothingmuch> it worked for me

[16:04] <pdcawley> Or possibly more complex. After all, what would you be doing if Pugs didn't exist?

[16:04] <stevan> pdcawley: Pugs makes life interesting

[16:04] <stevan> complexity ~~ fun

[16:05] <_Coke_> perlbot pmichaud?

[16:06] <nothingmuch> breakfast time

[16:09] <kolibrie> um, lunch time?

[16:09] <stevan> kolibrie: he is still in canada, eh

[16:10] <kolibrie> stevan: believe so, till tomorrow

[16:10] <kolibrie> stevan:  oops, forgot the 'eh'

[16:11] <stevan> :)

[16:11] <pdcawley> Not denying complexity ~~ fun, but I am questioning complexity ~~ easier

[16:14] <stevan> pdcawley: I think pugs has definitely made my life more complex, but it also gives me a great amount of satisfaction, which makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, which makes life more bearable, which means that I can trudge through $work much easier (or at least with much less psychic wear-and-tear)

[16:14] <stevan> so in a very round about way ....

[16:14] <stevan> but in this particular case, I was refering to the link to the SVK dmg file :)

[16:15] * kolibrie wonders if he must re-checkout before switching to svk

[16:15] <stevan> pdcawley: BTW - the metamodel is now in fairly decent shape, if you have the time, comments appreciated

[16:16] <stevan> kolibrie: IIRC you are not re-checking out, but mirroring the entire repo

[16:16] <kolibrie> so rm -rf pugs/; svk ...

[16:16] <autrijus> svk co http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/

[16:16] <integral> you don't have to mirror the whole lot, it takes ages.  you want svk sync's --skipto option

[16:16] <autrijus> hit enter ~inf times

[16:17] <autrijus> if you don't want to wait, answer 'h' instead of 'a'

[16:17] <autrijus> in the "how many revs to mirror" question

[16:17] <autrijus> that's all

[16:17] <autrijus> (but by ansering 'h' you los e past history'

[16:18] <kolibrie> so 'a' gets all revisions, 'h' gets most recent only?

[16:18] <autrijus> yup

[16:19] <kolibrie> is hitting enter ~inf avoidable?

[16:20] <autrijus> er, the ~inf is just like 3

[16:20] <autrijus> I think 

[16:20] <autrijus> so should be okay :)

[16:20] <autrijus> it's a small amount as infinity goes

[16:21] <kolibrie> ok, that sounds better

[16:26] * kolibrie watches svk pull down history, revision by revision

[16:33] <autrijus> hi cwest!

[16:33] <autrijus> glad to see you here :)

[16:38] * Limbic_Region pings cwest and wonders when/if he is going to do anything about the abomination that is Tie::SortHash

[16:38] * Limbic_Region meant that in the most friendly way possible

[16:40] <pasteling> "chromatic" at 63.105.17.30 pasted "Trace Showing Destructors Not Being Applied to All Objects (lambda-ers please read)" (76 lines, 2.5K) at http://sial.org/pbot/11477

[16:42] <autrijus> hm odd.

[16:47] <cwest> heya everyone

[16:49] * autrijus is still lunching

[16:50] * cwest too

[16:50] <autrijus> chromatic nopastes but is not on the channel himself

[16:50] <autrijus> oh well. it looks like some objects are still reachable from the root set

[16:50] <autrijus> I think I know why

[16:51] <Limbic_Region> autrijus - perhaps chromatic is watching the channel log and nopasted - expecting to get the response later

[16:52] <autrijus> nod

[16:52] <ingy> hi autrijus 

[16:52] <autrijus> yo ingy

[16:53] <autrijus> you made it safely back?

[16:53] <ingy> yes, and slept

[16:53] <autrijus> cool. I think I'll nap again

[16:53] <autrijus> sleep deprivation is hitting me like a torrent of bricks

[16:54] * nothingmuch waves

[16:55] <stevan> hey ingy

[16:55] <stevan> $work sucks :P

[16:55] <Limbic_Region> too bad there wasn't a way to remove your brain from your body when you slept so as to not consume energy solving problems when it is supposed to be resting

[16:57] <stevan> the net connection to our servers are down

[16:57] <stevan> now i really really really want/need SVK

[16:59] <kolibrie> distributed is very handy in that situation

[16:59] <stevan> yes

[16:59] <stevan> and a Supreme court justice is resigning

[16:59] * stevan thinks maybe he should have stayed in Canada

[17:02] <pdcawley>  stevan: Where's the meta stuff? Going to download and print it for persual in a more comfy chair...

[17:06] * _Coke_ wonders if anyone in perldom has met ingy when he was not operating under the influence or sleep deprivation.

[17:08] <nothingmuch> i think ingy has but one state

[17:08] <stevan> pdcawley: lib/Perl6-MetaModel

[17:08] <nothingmuch> i'll call it "dude".

[17:10] <_Coke_> people irc as root? huh.

[17:10] <pdcawley> ç

[17:11] <pdcawley> Kewl.

[17:14] <kungfuftr> castaway: *poke*

[17:15] <ingy> hi nothingmuch 

[17:15] <ingy> hi stevan 

[17:18] <nothingmuch> hi ingy 

[17:19] * ingy gives nothingmuch a Kiss

[17:19] <_Coke_> ingy: I was in the first row at your back to back talks, and was therefore contractually prohibited from making snarky comments. Good talks.

[17:20] <ingy> thanks!

[17:20] <nothingmuch> _Coke_: do you have a crush on ingy? I knew all those kisses were dangerous

[17:20] <_Coke_> I am now trying to convince leo to use Test::Base on parrot. he appears to be interested. =-)

[17:20] <_Coke_> nothingmuch: no, I will merely crush ingy.

[17:21] <ingy> _Coke_++

[17:21] * stevan things nothingmuch has a crush on ingy

[17:21] <nothingmuch> ofcourse i do

[17:21] <ingy> :)

[17:21] * nothingmuch is dissatisfied with the small amount of girlfriends collected on his tour of Canada

[17:21] <nothingmuch> .

[17:22] <stevan> nothingmuch: there is still time

[17:22] <nothingmuch> i think ingy will serve as a quality addition

[17:22] <stevan> I gave you $$ for the hooker

[17:22] <nothingmuch> no there isn't

[17:22] <nothingmuch> autrijus refuses to go to where the sun shines

[17:22] <_Coke_> ingy needs to shower more often. or sleep more. or write better slides.

[17:22] <stevan> _Coke_: if he showered then he would not have any time to make his slides, and therefore not sleep

[17:22] <stevan> it is all tightly coupled

[17:23] <stevan> nothingmuch: where did you install SVK from?

[17:24] <nothingmuch> same link as you

[17:24] <stevan> hmmm, it is complaining about my SVN not being compiled with perl bindings

[17:24] <nothingmuch> in fact I was about to point you to it, but autrijus was faster

[17:24] <nothingmuch> uh, that's odd

[17:24] <nothingmuch> i think it ships with svn

[17:25] <nothingmuch> oh wait, no

[17:25] <nothingmuch> OSX now ships with svn (woohoo!)

[17:25] <stevan> hmmm, maybe i should upgrade to tiger

[17:25] <nothingmuch> maybe

[17:25] <nothingmuch> it's been nice

[17:25] <nothingmuch> but you can also just install svn from the binary pkg

[17:25] <gugod> osx ships with svn ?

[17:25] <stevan> the $work servers are down, its not like I can do anything today anyway :)

[17:26] <nothingmuch> gugod: i didn't install svn, but it's there, so i thought it came in the svk dmg

[17:26] <nothingmuch> but appearantly it didn't

[17:26] <gugod> yes, svk dmg comes with svn

[17:26] <nothingmuch> which svn is /usr/bin

[17:26] <nothingmuch> oh, svk is also there

[17:26] <gugod> isn't that a symlink to /usr/local/svk-1.00/bin/svn ?

[17:26] <_Coke_> svn did not ship with tiger.

[17:26] <nothingmuch> yes, it is...

[17:26] <stevan> ahhhh, I see now

[17:26] * _Coke_ had to install it for tiger, just like he did for panther.

[17:26] <nothingmuch> confusion

[17:27] <nothingmuch> okay, svn does not ship for tiger

[17:27] <stevan> I have an svn in my /sw/bin

[17:27] <nothingmuch> it really *was* svk

[17:27] <_Coke_> there is a precompiled package, however, which is just fine.

[17:27] <_Coke_> (an apple style package, no fink)

[17:27] <nothingmuch> _Coke_: the confusion is because i didn't install svn but had it

[17:28] <nothingmuch> and I thought that svk provided it, and then thought it didn't provide it, and then realized it did provide it after all

[17:28] <gugod> the svk dmg has everything it needs to run svk

[17:28] <stevan> hmmm, now it says "Can't locate SVN/Core.pm in @INC"

[17:28] <nothingmuch> plug: http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?UNIVERSAL::isa

[17:29] * stevan grumbles something about OSS being difficult to install :P

[17:29] <nothingmuch> stevan: uh, is your perl also from /sw?

[17:29] <stevan> nope

[17:29] <nothingmuch> hm

[17:29] <stevan> nothingmuch: I tried to CPAN rate UNIVERSAL::isa, but it broke CPAN ratings

[17:29] <nothingmuch> OSS in this case (svk) was very very easy to install

[17:29] <stevan> only on 17 in powerbooks I guess :P

[17:30] <nothingmuch> stevan: prepend /usr/bin and /usr/local/svk-1.00-2/bin/ to your PATH

[17:30] <nothingmuch> wow, irssix has tab completion of paths

[17:30] <nothingmuch> that rocks

[17:31] * kolibrie ran apt-get install svk

[17:31] <clkao> suddenly #perl6 became #svk-install

[17:31] <kolibrie> of course, it also then downloaded 16MB of other stuff to upgrade

[17:31] <nothingmuch> clkao: you fix it then =)

[17:31] <PerlJam> clkao: so ... how long before the perl6 version of svk?  ;-)

[17:32] <integral> nothing uses perl5:SVK yet?

[17:32] <clkao> it works

[17:32] <clkao> and that's why i told autrijus and helped him with perl5 support in pugs

[17:36] <stevan> hmmm, SVN::Core is not in /usr/local/svk-1.00/perl/ either

[17:37] <stevan> oh wait

[17:37] <stevan> nevermind I found it

[17:46] <nothingmuch> initial Test::TAP::Model::Consolidated is in the darcs repo

[17:52] <stevan> what is that?

[17:52] <stevan> oh the diff-ed stuff

[17:52] <nothingmuch> yup

[17:52] <nothingmuch> on the model side

[17:52] <nothingmuch> i'm hacking diff you in first

[17:52] <nothingmuch> summary view later

[17:52] <nothingmuch> want to start summary?

[17:53] * stevan hides behind a terminal window so nothingmuch cant see him

[17:54] <nothingmuch> they are transparent on your machine ;-)

[17:54] <stevan> nothingmuch: we shall see, all depends on if the $work servers return

[17:54] * pdcawley asks his weekly 'does &?CALLER_CONTINUATION work yet?' question.

[17:54] * stevan quickly jumps behind an opaque Safari window 

[17:55] <nothingmuch> pdcawley: i'll prod autrijus when he wakes up, he's napping

[17:55] <pdcawley> wilco.

[17:56] <pdcawley> stevan: You have a recommended starting point for grokking Perl6-MetaModel?

[17:56] <nothingmuch> pdcawley: look in P5::PIL::Run::Container::Foo

[17:56] <stevan> pdcawley: lib/Perl6/MetaClass.pm might be a good spot

[17:56] <nothingmuch> where Foo is anything

[17:56] <nothingmuch> those are smple implementations

[17:56] <stevan> pdcawley: and the test suite

[17:57] <stevan> no docs, sorry :)

[17:57] <nothingmuch> but not meta ish in any way

[17:57] <pdcawley>  Ah... don't start with the Perl5 version?

[17:57] <nothingmuch> Perl6-MetaModel *is* in perl5

[17:57] <nothingmuch> it's a perl5 implementation of what metamodels in perl 6 should be like

[17:57] <pdcawley> Ah... sorry, was rooting my subdirectories in the wrong places...

[17:58] <pdcawley> was at pugs/ mentally, not pugs/lib/Perl6-MetaModel

[17:58] <pdcawley> forgive me.

[17:58] <nothingmuch> never

[17:58] <nothingmuch> you have insulted my honor

[17:58] <stevan> what honor?

[17:59] <nothingmuch> err, dignity?

[17:59] <nothingmuch> no wait, all out of that too

[17:59] <stevan> I think you lost that the first time you let ingy kiss you

[17:59] <nothingmuch> it was well worth it

[17:59] <nothingmuch> the smooth texture, melting in my mouth

[17:59] <pdcawley>  Ingy kissed you? 

[17:59] <pdcawley> <flounce>!

[17:59] <ingy> i didn't kiss anybody

[17:59] <nothingmuch> nono, he just gave me a kiss

[18:00] <ingy> right!

[18:00] <pdcawley> And, fact fans, the difference is?

[18:01] <stevan> well, before we answer this, is this going in the summary?

[18:01] <nothingmuch> http://www.conway.com/ssinsider/images/pw030616c.jpg

[18:01] <pdcawley> Probably not, we're on IRC.

[18:02] <Limbic_Region> pdcawley - you can still link to the IRC conversation in the logs though ;-)

[18:04] <_Coke_> http://www.camelshumpalpacafarm.com/photos/smooch.JPG

[18:04] <_Coke_> hey, is that allison?

[18:05] <nothingmuch> yup.... looks exactly like her

[18:05] * nothingmuch rolls eyes

[18:05] <qmole> lol

[18:05] <_Coke_> ok, you name the famous perl chick that it looks most like. =-)

[18:05] <nothingmuch> the hair color, the shape of her face, it's all the same

[18:05] <_Coke_> I mean, aside from ingy of course.

[18:05] <nothingmuch> uh, ingy

[18:05] <nothingmuch> damn!

[18:06] <nothingmuch> well, the one on the right side kind of looks like chip

[18:06] <nothingmuch> and that means that since the one on the left is choking him, he will kick her ass with some krav maga any moment now

[18:06] <stevan> huh, no mustache

[18:07] <nothingmuch> http://benicialiving.com/images/uploads/camel_kiss.jpg

[18:09] <nothingmuch> uck.. i just needed [==] @list in perl5

[18:10] <Khisanth> List::Util? :)

[18:10] <kungfuftr> [==] @list ?

[18:10] <nothingmuch> Khisanth: yes and no

[18:10] <nothingmuch> i'm using it

[18:10] <nothingmuch> but chaining semantics are the same

[18:10] <nothingmuch> kungfuftr: $list[0] == $list[1] == $list[2] ... == $list[n];

[18:11] <stevan> the real Chip and Allison (http://home.sergeant.org/D70/YAPC/Hallway%20Track/hallcon05_3.jpg?format=html)

[18:11] <kungfuftr> ah... so a set operation

[18:12] <nothingmuch> kungfuftr: no, not really

[18:12] <nothingmuch> circumfix [] takes an operator, and returns a listy operator

[18:13] <nothingmuch> that iterates through the list, and applies the operator it got initially on every pair

[18:13] <nothingmuch> with good semantics

[18:13] <nothingmuch> sub product (*@numbers) { [*] @numbers }

[18:13] <kungfuftr> ah... i see

[18:13] <nothingmuch> that's essentially like 'reduce { $a * $b } @numbers'

[18:14] <nothingmuch> but if it's boolean chaining operators, then it becomes funkier

[18:16] <nothingmuch> actually i think it's a precircumfix operator

[18:17] <nothingmuch> not a circumfix operator that returns an operator

[19:14] <svnbot6> r5136, putter++ | Created docs/SEEALSO.  Mainly to point to lib/pugs/*.pod.

[19:27] <dudley> Back from the midwife. It's a girl! Myles Phala Flanders, 7lbs, 12 oz.

[19:32] <rjbs> congratulations!

[19:32] <kolibrie> yes, congratulations!

[19:33] <integral> congrats!   But does she have the commiter bit yet? :-P

[19:34] <dudley> Not yet... but then again, neither do I... ; )

[19:35] <autrijus> dudley: if you give me two emails...

[19:37] <autrijus> I can make both of you commiters :)

[19:40] <dudley> dkf AT misnomer.us, myles AT misnomer.us

[19:41] <kolibrie> I suppose Myles will be our youngest committer

[19:43] <Darren_Duncan> question about YAPC and other conferences ...

[19:43] <Darren_Duncan> how common is it for people to have computers and/or not have computers with them?

[19:44] <Darren_Duncan> I don't have a portable but intend to go to OSCON 2005 (already paid, too late to refund), and am wondering whether it would be a good idea to borrow or rent a portable to take along

[19:44] <Darren_Duncan> I welcome advice

[19:45] <rjbs> something like 75% of people or better have laptops

[19:45] <autrijus> dudley: welcome aboard!

[19:45] <nothingmuch> Darren_Duncan: you can buy one, it's fun

[19:45] <nothingmuch> i bought a laptop at YAPC

[19:45] <kolibrie> a 17 inch!

[19:45] <nothingmuch> (my other laptop died)

[19:45] <autrijus> I hope the committer bit makes a good 0th birthday present

[19:45] <nothingmuch> =)

[19:45] <Darren_Duncan> I'm tight on money so can't buy one 'til next year

[19:46] <nothingmuch> os am I ;-)

[19:46] <nothingmuch> (well, now, after buying the laptop)

[19:46] <kolibrie> I didn't have one with me, and definitely felt very disconnected

[19:46] <Darren_Duncan> it's worse ... I'm borrowing the money to go and don't have a job ... hope to get one after I return

[19:47] <autrijus> it's like every talk is actually happening on both the realworld and the IRC as another track

[19:47] <kolibrie> if you borrow one, don't spill coffee on it

[19:47] <autrijus> in parallel. so borrowing a laptop is useful

[19:47] <nothingmuch> or beer

[19:47] <dudley> All right, thanks! It's a hell of a day today... : D

[19:47] <nothingmuch> Darren_Duncan: eek.

[19:47] <nothingmuch> OSCON is expensive, YAPC isn't

[19:48] <nothingmuch> you should have swapped the two...

[19:48] <pjcj> dudley: Congratulations! I'm glad you didn't choose Pugs as a middle name ...

[19:48] <Darren_Duncan> I thought OSCON would be cheaper because I don't have to fly ... it's only 1 day's ground travel away from where I live

[19:49] <Darren_Duncan> I recognize that YAPC is cheaper, but thought flying costs would be prohibitive

[19:49] <kolibrie> they can be

[19:49] <Darren_Duncan> my total estimated costs for OSCON 2005 is about CDN$2200 : $1700 conference, $350 hotel, $150 travel

[19:50] <Darren_Duncan> that's with early reg plus user group discount, and having 3 or 4 people in the room

[19:50] <obra> $350 for the hotel? Where are you staying?

[19:50] <obra> ah.

[19:50] <Darren_Duncan> Red Lion ... that is for 6 nights

[19:50] <Darren_Duncan> same place Peter Scott is staying, and he lives in Victoria where I do

[19:51] <Darren_Duncan> its just across from the conference center I believe

[19:52] <Darren_Duncan> regardless of computer own/borrow, is it worthwhile to get travelling insurance, or would the laptop be covered by regular home owner insurance?

[19:52] <putter> I'm dusting the wiki a bit... where is there a _rendered_ version of the yapc talk?

[19:53] <nothingmuch> http://pugscode.org/talks/yapc/index.html

[19:53] <Darren_Duncan> separate question ...

[19:53] <putter> thanks!

[19:53] <Darren_Duncan> I plan to apply to give a Lightning Talk at OSCON ... getting right out there in my first conference

[19:54] <Darren_Duncan> are there videos online of previous Lightning Talks so I can see how other people deliver theirs?

[19:56] <_Coke_> ... quickly.

[19:56] <nothingmuch> Darren_Duncan: uhm, you don't want to know what our lightning talks were like..

[19:56] <nothingmuch> there were ninjas, and juggling

[19:56] <Darren_Duncan> I saw pictures and so have an idea

[19:56] <Darren_Duncan> but sound and motion would be helpful too

[19:57] <_Coke_> luke++

[19:57] <Darren_Duncan> I wanted to do one of the things which Lightning Talks are good for, and put up a quick introduction to my Rosetta/SQL::Routine work plus their Perl 6 versions that exist at the time

[19:57] <nothingmuch> http://hew.ca/cgi-bin/page.pl?Day=Day%203&person_name=

[19:58] <PerlJam> Darren_Duncan: speak fast, don't go into too much detail, and be dramatic and/or humorous.  You'll be fine.

[19:58] <nothingmuch> should be uploaded there soon

[19:58] <Darren_Duncan> I thought so ... but it's still nice to see examples ... I don't have any previous conferences to draw experience from

[19:59] <Darren_Duncan> thanks for the url, nothingmuch, will check back when movies up

[19:59] <Darren_Duncan> this said, I wouldn't mind seeing ones from previous years also

[20:00] <Darren_Duncan> will try more thorough google search than before

[20:00] <PerlJam> Wasn't it autrijus who did a CPAN lightning talk? 

[20:00] <pdcawley_> stevan about?

[20:00] <Darren_Duncan> he was about 2 hours ago

[20:01] <pdcawley_> Ah... just I've finally got 'round to looking at Perl6-MetaModel

[20:05] <autrijus> PerlJam: yeah http://autrijus.org/favcpan/

[20:06] <PerlJam> Darren_Duncan: there you go!  Emulate autrijus :-)

[20:06] <autrijus> that was the only time I got a standing ovation :)

[20:07] <Darren_Duncan> looking ...

[20:08] <kolibrie> so... where's the soundtrack?

[20:08] <PerlJam> Darren_Duncan: or treat it like a poetry reading

[20:08] <PerlJam> Darren_Duncan: or a song

[20:08] <Darren_Duncan> btw, speaking of emulating, I always thought taking a few examples from Steve Jobs talks would be good

[20:09] <Darren_Duncan> I can't sing ... but who knows, the poetry angle might work

[20:10] <PerlJam> A couple of years ago I did a few lightning talks on perl6 for the local CS club.  It seems like now would be a good time to do that again (especially now that pugs is here)

[20:11] <autrijus> kolibrie: http://www.perl.org/tpc/2003/audio/perl-lt/

[20:11] <autrijus> poetry-reading is fine but don't go overboard...

[20:11] <autrijus> I read the first few pugs poems in my yapc talk 

[20:12] <autrijus> then on the second half I announced I've used my Vogon quota

[20:12] <autrijus> so I'll no longer subject the audience to poetry reading

[20:12] <PerlJam> an LT on pugs or parrot or PGE or why-everything-starts-with-P would do well today

[20:12] <autrijus> some of them look quite relieved

[20:12] <autrijus> LT?

[20:12] <autrijus> oh, lightning talk

[20:12] <Darren_Duncan> the easiest thing for me to do is just talk ... like with the longer panels but short, sweet, and any questions

[20:13] <Darren_Duncan> I'm not that dramatic ... mainly I just don't want to be boring

[20:14] <kolibrie> autrijus: cool, thanks

[20:14] <PerlJam> Darren_Duncan: well, talk in exaggerated imbic pentameter or something and it won't be boring :)

[20:14] <PerlJam> iambic even

[20:16] <Darren_Duncan> thanks for the http://www.perl.org/tpc/2003/audio/perl-lt/ link ... and I'll lookup other videos around the same place too

[20:22] <gaal> heya.

[20:22] <Darren_Duncan> heya

[20:23] <gaal> autrijus, this is a remooser about pugscc :)

[20:23] <Darren_Duncan> I just watched the autrijus rap video ... quite nice but I couldn't understand most of it

[20:23] <gaal> something instead of show for TVars is needed

[20:23] <Darren_Duncan> now to more videos ...

[20:23] <autrijus> gaal: yes, I have this line in my todo:

[20:23] <gaal> i asked on #haskell and my mind was bended some.

[20:23] <autrijus> pugs: zeroderef prelude pugscc quaname

[20:23] <gaal> i can work on the prelude if pugscc is fixed

[20:24] <kungfuftr> theorbtwo: moo?

[20:24] <autrijus> goodie. let me take a quick look

[20:24] <gaal> though i still haven't really figured out how to get make to enter a new rule at the end of another one

[20:24] <gaal> okay: the probelm afaik was that TVars show to "<ref>" which doesn't compile.

[20:25] <gaal> (obviously)

[20:26] <stevan> pdcawley: ping

[20:27] <autrijus> gaal: where does <ref> occur? only in envGlobal?

[20:27] <gaal> yes

[20:27] <gaal> globC

[20:27] <putter> ok, wiki dusted.

[20:27] <gaal> wherever there's a TVar, really

[20:27] <Yaakov> autrijus: In one of the group photos you are glowing.

[20:28] <Yaakov> autrijus: Somehow, it is appropriate.

[20:28] <autrijus> Yaakov: it's just the LCD backlight :)

[20:28] <Yaakov> No, this is three bright stripes.

[20:29] <autrijus> that is my scottevest.

[20:29] <Yaakov> But, there is one where everyone but you is looking at the camera, you appear to be programming.

[20:29] <gaal> oh, autrijus, envDebug is Just <ref> too.

[20:29] <gaal> in some places.

[20:30] <autrijus> Yaakov: in fact I was in #perl mumbling about how long the photo taking took, with many rotating cameras

[20:30] <stevan> Yaakov: thats because he was proabbly programing

[20:30] <Yaakov> Heh.

[20:30] <Yaakov> I prefer to imagine you were implementing --^~`  (Whatever that means in pewrl 6).

[20:30] <Khisanth> rotating cameras?! isn't that that the photography equivalent of copy and pasting code? ;)

[20:31] <Yaakov> Khisanth: No, it is the equivalent of RAID.

[20:31] <Yaakov> RAEC.

[20:31] <Yaakov> (Expensive Cameras)

[20:31] <pdcawley_> Not panoramic jobs? 

[20:31] <autrijus> Yaakov: I prefer to ruthlessly shatter any rumours of my alledged sainthood :)

[20:31] <pdcawley_> NOBLEX etc...

[20:31] <pdcawley_> Horizont...

[20:32] * autrijus is actually jsut a Friar

[20:32] <Yaakov> autrijus: There is a fine line between saint and maniac.

[20:32] <Yaakov> It is my impression you crossed it.

[20:33] * autrijus needs to practice more on impressionism

[20:33] <Yaakov> autrijus: In any case, I have no illusions of you as saint.  I just appreciate your unique merit.

[20:33] <Odin-LAP> You mean there are no manic saints?

[20:33] <autrijus> Yaakov: but thanks for your kind words :)

[20:33] <putter> autrijus: fyi, I'm not seeing/pinging autrijus.org.  packets appear to disappear in a hinet.net router.

[20:34] <autrijus> putter: that's an adsl and it looks like it just went down

[20:34] <putter> k

[20:34] <autrijus> worst case it'll be up in 36 hours when I'm physically back

[20:35] <gaal> what's the topic of the rap lightning talk?

[20:35] <autrijus> gaal: "1% of my favourite cpan"

[20:35] <autrijus> http://www.perl.org/tpc/2003/presentations/

[20:35] <gaal> i see why you have to talk so fast

[20:37] <gaal> (lots of stuff to include)

[20:37] <brentdax> Are all the Perl 6 design documents up somewhere I can grab them?  I have a project I need to work on with Pugs when I have limited/no Internet access.

[20:37] <gaal> cpan Perl6::Bible

[20:37] <PerlJam> brentdax: they are in the svn repository.

[20:37] <stevan> brentdax: however, they are not very up to date

[20:38] <stevan> so don't believe anything you read :P

[20:38] <brentdax> Heh.

[20:38] <autrijus> brentdax: Perl6::Bible is usually good enough.

[20:39] <autrijus> if it's not uptodate, send patch to pmichaud

[20:39] <autrijus> he vowed to review and apply every one of them

[20:39] <Yaakov> autrijus: I installed the Haskell compiler on my notebook because of your talk.

[20:40] <gaal> shakespeare in the talk, lol

[20:40] <Yaakov> Actually, your talk tipped the balance.  A lot of people I respect have mentioned it favorably, you just pushed it over the edge.

[20:41] <autrijus> cool :)

[20:42] <PerlJam> pugs was enough to tip the balance for me.  I'd played with haskell in the past but never so much as when I saw what autrijus could do with it.

[20:43] <gaal> autrijus: for loading the precompiled prelude: this should be enough for the actual loading, right?

[20:43] <gaal> # runEnv env{ envBody = Pugs.PreludePC.ast, envGlobal = Pugs.PreludePC.glob, envDebug = Nothing }

[20:43] * _Coke_ tries to remember if brentdax was one of the people he needed to bug.

[20:44] <brentdax> Bug about what?

[20:44] <gaal> with ast and glob being what -CPugs gave for Prelude.pm

[20:44] <_Coke_> Exactly.

[20:44] * _Coke_ scratches his head.

[20:44] <_Coke_> Perhaps you're just famous. =-)

[20:44] <integral> does this compiled prelude require two links?

[20:44] <gaal> "i should have listened to what my mother told me"

[20:44] <_Coke_> what did she say?

[20:44] <clkao> dear autrijus, do you know if it's possible to set rt.openfoundry's admincc to the list hosted by it

[20:44] <gaal> "i don't know, i didn't listsen"

[20:45] <clkao> (for svk, of course)

[20:45] <_Coke_> *bow* we'll be here all week!

[20:45] <PerlJam> _Coke_: what's brentdax famous for?

[20:46] <autrijus> gaal: yes, I thnk

[20:48] <autrijus> gaal: fixed for simple cases (i.e. when user doesn't have 'sub foo {}')

[20:49] <autrijus> the crux of the matter is that each sub contains a ref to its subEnv

[20:49] <autrijus> but we can't fully serialise env without using some kind of recursion

[20:49] <svnbot6> r5137, autrijus++ | * perl script/pugscc --run -e 'say 1+3' now compiles again

[20:49] <svnbot6> r5137, autrijus++ |   (need to test non-TH builds)

[20:49] <gaal> is it okay to call withSocketsDo more than once?

[20:49] <gaal> # http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/network/Network.Socket.html#v%3AwithSocketsDo

[20:50] <autrijus> I think yes

[20:50] <gaal> sounds like it's okay

[20:50] <autrijus> gaal: so I'm not quite sure how to go about fully serializing subEnv 

[20:50] <autrijus> maybe just do the same as with Compile VCode

[20:50] <gaal> autrijus, the #haskell folks had some ideas which at some point i thought i almost understood

[20:50] <autrijus> recursive mdo?

[20:50] <gaal> about serializing STM

[20:51] <autrijus> okie.

[20:51] <gaal> is their channel logged?

[20:51] <autrijus> yes I think, google around a bit?

[20:51] <autrijus> (or just ask)

[20:51] <autrijus> I'm feeling dizzy again... I think I need to nap a bit. see you around dinner time (i.e. <2hr)

[20:51] <_Coke_> pmichaud++

[20:52] <autrijus> gaal: but "normal" pugscc should work now

[20:52] <gaal> i'll prolly not be here, but thanks :)

[20:52] <brentdax> Not really used to running a computer on a battery.

[21:00] <nothingmuch> kungfuftr: ping

[21:04] <gaal> autrijus, for when you backlog: http://meme.b9.com/~164b38dd44af46a994821081~/cview.html?channel=haskell&date=050701 and vgrep for TVar

[21:05] <gaal> anyway: the prelude looks good with pugscc now.

[21:18] <nothingmuch> does anybody here think they can help Test::TAP::HTMLMatrix with some js?

[21:18] <pasteling> "gaal" at 192.115.25.249 pasted "when trying to runEnv the result of -CPugs" (18 lines, 781B) at http://sial.org/pbot/11479

[21:19] <_Coke_> what sort of js?

[21:35] <nothingmuch> _Coke_: sorry, zonked

[21:36] <nothingmuch> Test::TAP::HTMLMatrix is going to support consolidation of several reports

[21:37] <nothingmuch> for every file, if all the versions of the file are the same, then there will be a little [+] sign on the left

[21:37] <nothingmuch> when you click it, it expands, and the [+] is replaced with a [-]

[21:37] <nothingmuch> then you can mouse over all of the versions, to see different diags, or whatever

[21:37] <nothingmuch> when the versions are different, like for example, test case 6 of file t/foo.t fails on windows, then all versions of that file are automatically expanded

[21:37] <nothingmuch> and the background of this cluster is darkened

[21:38] <nothingmuch> i need the code to do [+] and [-]

[21:38] <nothingmuch> i was thinking of stealing it from wikipedia's TOC hiding code

[21:38] <nothingmuch> but then i found out that I don't like reading HTML code intertwined with JS

[21:38] <nothingmuch> so I thought i'll excercise delegation, which is a good pattern

[21:39] <nothingmuch> damn, I want roles

[21:39] <nothingmuch> in perl 5

[21:52] <brentdax> Is there something Ubuntu (or Debian) might have left out that would stop Perl 5 interop from compiling?

[21:54] * putter wonders if autrijus could use a vacation... eating well, sleeping half the day, etc.  Tweaking clock speed up high.

[21:56] <obra> heh

[21:57] <stevan> nothingmuch: use the CSS display property

[21:58] <stevan> for the [+] and [-] stuff

[22:01] <cwest> Vacations are the killer of progress because you have to recover from them.

[22:12] <putter> :)

[22:17] <nothingmuch> stevan: can you do that stuff?

[22:17] * Yaakov sets Casey on fire to help him recover.

[22:33] <pdcawley> Stevan: How much can I refactor that metamodel?

[22:33] <pdcawley> 'cos there's far too many 'big ole subroutines' with responsibilities in the wrong place.

[22:47] <nothingmuch> pdcawley: i'd say as much as you want, but try to comit changes incrementally

[22:48] <pdcawley> Okay. I'm pulling Perl6::MetaModel::class out into a Perl6::ClassBuilder class, that way I can share the 'name' and 'param' and use a template method.

[22:53] <putter> Has anyone used eval('...',:lang<pir>)?

[23:25] <pasteling> "pdcawley" at 217.146.110.1 pasted "Perl6::ClassBuilder for Stevan" (110 lines, 2.9K) at http://sial.org/pbot/11482

[23:25] <pdcawley> I haven't checked it in 'cos I got carried away refactoring and I've not quite implemented all the methods on Perl6::MetaClass yet.

[23:27] <pdcawley> Plus, it's half past midnight, and my mother always told me never to check anything in after midnight when you've been up since 6.

[23:28] <clkao>     

[23:28] <clkao> .!

[23:30] <pjcj> pdcawley's mother's maiden name was Lovelace?

[23:32] <autrijus> no, her maiden name was Byron.

[23:32] <clkao> hey autrijus don't ignore my question about openfoundry :p

[23:33] <autrijus> clkao: I didn't see them. what questions?

[23:33] <clkao> 04:44 < clkao> dear autrijus, do you know if it's possible to set rt.openfoundry's admincc to the list hosted

[23:33] <clkao>           by it

[23:34] <autrijus> clkao: sure, it's possible.

[23:35] <autrijus> you can do that by adding a new user using the list address and then add the user as the proj admin

[23:35] <autrijus> quite roundabout

[23:35] <autrijus> but will work

[23:35] <autrijus> otherwise I can just change the setting for you

[23:36] <autrijus> would you like that?

[23:37] <autrijus> (or, even more simpler -- just change your own email addr into the svk list addr)

[23:37] * autrijus goes upstairs in search of dinner

[23:38] <clkao> ?!?

[23:41] <obra>  so you can get your password reminders sent to svk-dev

[23:41] <autrijus> that would be very cool indeed.

[23:41] <autrijus> (not.)

[23:42] <autrijus> clkao: so you want me to just new a nonpriviledged user svk-dev and add it to admincc?

[23:43] <clkao> ya, please

[23:43] <clkao> and i'm not in a mood that appreciate bad humours

[23:44] <autrijus> very well. done.

[23:45] <autrijus> you can tell that I'm sleepy when I start spewing very bad humours

[23:45] <autrijus> sadly in the past 24 hours I'm constantly sleepy.

[23:46] <clkao> flying home

[23:46] <clkao> ?

[23:46] <Limbic_Region> autrijus - long flight home - perhaps you unplug and just sleep?

[23:47] <autrijus> that sounds nice. need food too

[23:47] <autrijus> clkao: yeah

[23:50] <Limbic_Region> not that you need any advice from me - but figuring out a way to shut your brain down first is the key to the sleep being refreshing

[23:58] <autrijus> I'd like to learn that

[23:58] <autrijus> ;)
