[01:47] <meppl> gute nacht  -  good night

[02:17] * scrottie waves to Juerd

[02:51] <autrijus> rehi \camels

[02:51] <autrijus> <- about to go to airport in 4 minutes

[02:51] <autrijus> wish me safe travel etc :)

[02:52] <coral> hi

[02:52] <coral> travel etc

[02:52] <autrijus> thanks etc

[02:52] <mugwump> have a great time in ::na!

[02:56] * autrijus waves &

[03:12] <svnbot6> r4899, mugwump++ | Add notes about discovered bugs ... more later

[03:26] <spinclad> safe trip and all

[03:34] <coral> wtf

[03:34] <coral> autrijus++ # converges to 2*pi

[03:34] <coral> HAHAHA

[04:59] * autrijus praises free wifi in the vienna airport

[04:59] <obra> Hi autrijus 

[04:59] <autrijus> yo obra.

[04:59] <obra> How goes?

[04:59] <autrijus> still 25min to go till boarding

[05:00] <autrijus> just fine... got a huge list of issues listed on the ThinkPad to work out thru hackathon

[05:00] * obra plans a birthday present for himself. No customer work tomorrow :)

[05:00] * obra grins

[05:01] <autrijus> oh wow. the billboard says boarding in 25 mins but the announcer says 5mins till boarding

[05:01] * autrijus wonders why is it the case

[05:01] <coral> human-connected systems

[05:01] <obra> autrijus: fly safe

[05:01] <autrijus> indeed.

[05:01] <autrijus> obra: thanks!

[05:02] * autrijus waves &

[05:09] <mugwump> I almost missed a plane because of that on my last flight

[05:09] <mugwump> after having already missed 2 planes on that journey, that would really have been adding insult to injury

[05:10] <mugwump> no "boarding" light by my flight.  So I thought I'd saunter up through the security and wait at the gate.  Sure enough, I get hurried to board.

[05:11] <Khisanth> bad airport?

[05:13] <mugwump> one of the other planes I'd missed was on the way there from that airport because the information/service was rubbish

[05:14] <mugwump> And because the airline didn't have any communications... they had faxed authorisation of my boarding before they turned me away

[05:15] * mugwump sighs

[05:15] <arcady> yeah, airlines are annoying

[05:15] <mugwump> all because a travel agent didn't post my tickets to me

[05:15] <arcady> I found out the hard way that for American I have to check in at least 45 minutes before the flight

[05:15] <mugwump> or even indicate I needed to pick them up

[05:16] <arcady> it's been a long time since I've actually had a real ticket...

[05:17] <mugwump> that's what I said, and the travel agent said to me, "don't you know that travel from $airport always needs paper tickets?"

[05:17] <mugwump> then she started saying about how far above and beyond they'd gone by paying the rebooking fee

[05:17] <mugwump> I really chewed her out for that comment

[05:18] <Khisanth> arcady: I think the recommendation was 90 minutes

[05:19] <mugwump> varies per country/airport/intl. vs. natl.

[05:19] <mugwump> I was told 20 minutes once :)

[05:20] <Khisanth> I mean in the US

[05:20] * Khisanth has only been on a plane 2 or 3 times

[05:25] <arcady> the worst thing is that airlines have different standards

[05:26] <arcady> but at least getting there early gives you time to prepare yourself when you get that SSSS on the boarding pass

[05:31] <mugwump> SSSS?

[05:33] <arcady> Sucker Selected for Special Search

[05:33] <arcady> well, it's what they print on your boarding pass if you are a "selectee"

[05:33] <arcady> for the special detailed search

[05:36] <mugwump> that's a pretty fucking dumb thing to print on someone's card

[05:37] <mugwump> but hey, I bet it cuts down on (detected) airport crime!  :)

[05:39] <arcady> yeah, it's a security hole that's been discussed to great lengths already

[06:18] * geoffb resolves out of the aether

[06:18] <geoffb> FINALLY caught up on last 4 days of #perl6

[06:18] <geoffb> And might I say:

[06:19] <geoffb> iblech++ putter++ autrijus++ # 'cause ... DAMN.

[06:19] <geoffb> And I bet I forgot a few . . . but those are the ones I saw so many times I lost count

[06:20] <geoffb> autrijus, when you're back: Did you ever manage to get the OpenFoundry bug hammered out?

[06:21] <geoffb> autrijus, also: what do you mean when you say 'gnoming'?  From context I get: "banging away on something in the background until it is better"

[06:42] <gaal> geoffb: http://gnoming.net/episodeii/images.html for example

[06:46] <geoffb> gaal, yes, that meaning came up a lot in the Google results.  It didn't seem to fit autrijus' meaning

[06:46] * geoffb in his "straight man" mode

[06:53] <nothingmuch> morning!

[06:55] <nothingmuch> does anyone know the budapest airport

[06:57] <geoffb> nope -- that would imply significantly more worldliness than I can afford.  :-)

[07:08] <svnbot6> r4901, geoffb++ | * Add newly created second-level directories to pugs::hack

[07:12] <geoffb> OK, time for bed.

[07:12] <scrottie> sleep well!

[07:12] <geoffb> thx, scrottie 

[07:14] <nothingmuch> ciao

[07:30] <nothingmuch> 4 hours

[07:30] <nothingmuch> no, 5 hours

[07:32] <ingy> Records show that three types of short nosed dogs were bred  by the Chinese.They were the Lion dog, the Pekingese and the Lo-sze.The Lo-sze or "Foo Dog" was the ancient Pug.

[07:32] <ingy> Foo Dog indeed

[07:32] <nothingmuch> =)

[07:33] <ingy> have a nice flight

[07:33] <ingy> what time of day do you arrive in Toronto?

[07:33] <nothingmuch> 14 hours

[07:34] <ingy> oh, I land 19:30ish

[07:34] <ingy> oh right... on Weds

[07:34] <ingy> when does autrijus arrive?

[07:34] <nothingmuch> in around 5 hours

[07:35] <ingy> yow

[07:35] <nothingmuch> yeah, poor him

[07:35] <ingy> is chip flying with him?

[07:35] <nothingmuch> i don't think so

[07:35] <nothingmuch> chip is arriving tomorrow

[07:37] * nothingmuch heapifies harrorth

[07:40] <nothingmuch> aha! i think I have a use for gadts!

[10:30] <Shillo> Hullo, all.

[10:31] <Juerd> Hi.

[11:12] <Shillo> http://www.sidhe.org/~dan/blog/ got a pretty cool read. Dan decided to publish his old notes on Parrot. :)

[11:20] *** Aragone is now known as Arathorn

[11:22] <Arathorn> so, is anyone actually going to explain to the guys on the sidelines what on earth happened such that dan packed it all in?

[11:24] <Shillo> Don't ask me, I'm a guy on the sidelines. ;)

[11:27] <mugwump> arathorn: he didn't pack it in, he just moved on, AIUI.  But I'm a latecomer to the picture.

[11:35] * Arathorn nods

[11:35] <Arathorn> but still, he implies that general terribleness happened of some flavour to incline him to move on

[11:36] <acme_> sometimes people just burn out

[11:36] <Arathorn> if that's what happened, then fair enough

[11:36] <Arathorn> if that's not what happened, then the community should learn from whatever mistakes/screwups occurred

[11:37] <Arathorn> lest someday the dudes on the sidelines are in a position to unintentionally repeat them :)

[11:38] <mugwump> well, the archives are there, feel free to read.

[11:38] <Arathorn> has there been a postmortem that i've missed, then?

[11:38] * Arathorn looks

[11:39] * mugwump cues "Sing for the moment" by Eminem, raising strange disapproving&disappointed looks from the onlookers

[11:40] <Arathorn> only mention I ever saw was dan saying "there was a *lot* of tension, but not on the lists"

[11:42] <mugwump> my take on it is this: any take on it this close to the event is sensationalism

[11:43] <Arathorn> very meta

[11:43] <Arathorn> i just hope someone has a take on it before everyone prefers to forget about it all :)

[11:43] <Shillo> Anyhow, his blog says he's going to be on YAPC::NA, so...

[11:43] <Shillo> He's not -quite- out of the picture.

[11:47] * Arathorn finally finds the threads in question on p6i

[11:48] <Arathorn> all makes sense

[11:48] <Arathorn> (well, more than it did before)

[12:04] <Shillo> Arathorn: Well, didn't make much sense to me, to be honest. I was a part of one or two discussions where Dan got really worked out, and I still frankly don't understand why he did.

[12:05] <Shillo> I'm not sure I want to know, though.  ;)

[12:06] <Arathorn> i'd somehow managed to miss the threads where he got stressed - and it seems to be over design decisions

[12:06] <Arathorn> e.g. the whole missing MMD default function stuff

[12:07] <Arathorn> so if you step down from glorious leader, and then disagree with the subsequent decisions, no surprise you'd want to walk away

[14:54] *** crysflame is now known as coral

[15:16] <geoffb> So iblech,

[15:16] <geoffb> I've been meaning to ask, your svn properties script does the application, but how are you choosing which files to apply to?  Just watching for "A" in the output from SVK or SVN?

[15:17] <iblech> Basically yes. But of course, I manually check if it's really a non-binary file.

[15:18] <geoffb> nodnod

[15:18] <iblech> If somebody would checkin a .png, I'll add svn:mime-type -> image/png and don't set svn:eol-style

[15:18] <geoffb> Yeah, that's what I've been doing to determine when I need to update hack.bod

[15:18] <geoffb> er hack.pod

[15:18] <geoffb> nodnod

[16:09] <svnbot6> r4905, iblech++ | * Usual svn properties added to mugwump++'s new ext/Data files.

[16:09] <svnbot6> r4905, iblech++ | * Pugs.Compile.PIR -- Even though commit r4903 did work, it was wrong --

[16:09] <svnbot6> r4905, iblech++ |   attempted a cleaner fix.

[16:14] * broquaint wonders if iblechbot replaced his creator ...

[16:19] <geoffb> what does iblechbot do?

[16:20] <geoffb> Or is it just a login from a different system?

[16:20] <iblech> broquaint: :D

[16:20] <iblech> geoffb: iblechbot is a simple (well, actually rather complex) IRC log bot, written in Perl 5 using POE

[16:21] <geoffb> why complex?

[16:21] <wilx> Because POE is beyond reach of any mortal being.

[16:22] <iblech> geoffb: (See http://m19s28.vlinux.de/iblech/iblechbot-2.png for a screenshot of its web interface)

[16:23] <iblech> geoffb: There're three parts: 1. The bot, which simply joins some channels and stays connected. The complexity here is that the bot should reconnect if the connection died, etc.

[16:23] <geoffb> nodnod

[16:24] <geoffb> (and not a bad UI -- an improvement on the official channel logger's UI

[16:24] <geoffb> the colabti.de one, I mean

[16:25] <iblech> Then there's part 2., an logging IRC proxy. Part 1. does not directly connect to irc.foo.org, but it uses an IRC proxy. This proxy doesn't change the data which is transmitted, but it logs the replies it gets from the server -- i.e. PRIVMSG, NOTICE, JOIN, PART, etc. Additionally, it injects /WHO #channel for each channel the bot is on, to get fresh realname information about the users on the channels

[16:25] <iblech> geoffb: Indeed

[16:26] <geoffb> iblech, interesting

[16:26] <iblech> geoffb: And then there's part 3., the web interface, which uses a graph to determine the minimum number of nick colors necessary (less colors ==> more contrasting colors, more colors ==> less contrasting colors)

[16:26] <geoffb> (y)

[16:27] <geoffb> definitely cool.  released?

[16:28] <iblech> Technically it is (i.e. the .tar.bz2 is online -- http://m19s28.vlinux.de/iblech/iblechbot.html), but there's no documentation etc.

[16:28] <geoffb> tsk, tsk.  ;-)

[16:30] <iblech> BTW, I then rewrote each part several times =) (Net::IRC -> POE::Component::IRC, POE::Component::Server::HTTP -> HTTP::Daemon, IO::Socket -> POE::Component::Server::TCP)

[16:31] <geoffb> Interesting that two went to POE and one went *away* from POE

[16:32] * geoffb has never used POE as he has for years just written his own event systems and is now used to his creations

[16:34] <iblech> (Choose the right tool for the job)++ :)

[16:34] <geoffb> Hmmm, does the karma bot know about (...)?

[16:34] <geoffb> karma job)

[16:34] <jabbot> geoffb: job) has neutral karma

[16:34] <geoffb> karma (Choose the right tool for the job)

[16:34] <jabbot> geoffb: (Choose the right tool for the job) has neutral karma

[16:35] <Limbic_Region> IOW - if it is un-balanced parens you are SOL

[16:35] <geoffb> Limbic_Region, huh?

[16:36] <iblech> karma Choose the right tool for the job

[16:36] <jabbot> iblech: Choose the right tool for the job has neutral karma

[16:36] <Limbic_Region> you have to group with parens - but if you have both a space and only 1 paren - it isn't possible to karma it

[16:36] <Limbic_Region> oh - and that's perlbot not jabbot

[16:36] <Limbic_Region> perlbot karma for Choose the right tool for the job

[16:36] <perlbot> Karma for Choose the right tool for the job: 1

[16:36] <geoffb> ah

[16:37] <geoffb> so I take it jabbot replies to anything it sees, whereas perlbot needs to be asked directly

[16:37] <geoffb> ?

[16:37] * Limbic_Region is only used to perlbot having primarily hung out in freenode's #perl 

[16:38] * geoffb has been only on channels without info bots between about college and this month.  :-0

[19:04] *** Arathorn is now known as Aragone

[19:10] *** taeli is now known as japhacakes

[21:07] <integral> hmm, is src/Pugs/Compile/PIR/Prelude.hs causing build problems for others too?

[21:08] <geoffb> Hmmm, haven't pulled in a while, will do so now and check

[21:08] <integral> .oO( I should figure out how to check smoke reports )

[21:08] * geoffb just finished writing outline and all code steps for next OpenGL/Perl article

[21:09] <geoffb> Hmmm, src/Pugs/Compile/PIR.hs changed, but not .../Prelude.hs

[21:09] <geoffb> rebuilding anyway

[21:10] <geoffb> (You had good timing, integral -- you asked just as I did 'svn commit' in other window and thought "I need to take a break from this.")

[21:11] <geoffb> Reminds me, need to re-checkout that tree using SVK, now that I have that tool in my arsenal . . . muahahaha

[21:13] <integral> just looks like gen_prelude needs hacked, and the Makefile

[21:14] <integral> err, nope, gen_prelude already supports different module names :-)

[21:14] <integral> hmm, and it appears the Makefile.PL already calls it correctly :-/

[21:15] <geoffb> Pugs.Compile.PIR.Prelude compiled just fine for me, but I have embed == P5 on, Parrot off

[21:15] <integral> ah, I've got parrot on

[21:17] <geoffb> Given that I actually have an SVK mirror of parrot, I suppose I should get around to actually building and installing it, so I can turn parrot embed on . . . .

[21:17] <integral> hmm, and the Makefile is calling gen_prelude correctly :-/

[21:18] * integral guesses that his gen_prelude isn't rebuild by make unoptimized

[21:18] <integral> nope, wrong guess

[21:18] <geoffb> could be.  I'm in a habit of "make realclean" before every build

[21:18] * geoffb doesn't trust makefiles.  Er, pretty much ever.

[21:18] <integral> hmm!  well it rebuild after I deleted the file,  the mtime must have been mucked up or something

[21:19] <geoffb> wheee

[21:19] <integral> ah, if I did that everytime I'd never stop compiling =)

[21:19] <integral> ah, src/gen_prelude has no deps >-|

[21:19] <geoffb> I usually only compile pugs once a day, while I'm reading the backlog in the morning

[21:19] <geoffb> So the machine multitasks for a while, and it's not such a big deal.

[21:20] <geoffb> Then again, I'm mostly writing tests and waiting for --perl5 support to get further along, rather than hacking src/...

[21:20] <integral> I'm low on memory, so it's a bit of a pain, and 2 minutes is nicer than 10 :-)

[21:20] <geoffb> Yeah, my box is pretty memory-tight as well.

[21:21] <geoffb> I made the mistake a bit ago of deciding to bring up a firefox window to browse while I waited, AFTER starting the pugs compile.  The old SCSI disk had a swap conniption.

[21:22] * integral hopes the omission wasn't deliberate, and commits

[21:25] <geoffb> Anybody have any idea when autrijus and nothingmuch are supposed to be back online?

[21:26] <geoffb> OK, time to get AFK for a while

[21:34] <svnbot6> r4906, bsmith++ | Added src/gen_prelude.hs as a dependency of src/gen_prelude.exe.

[21:35] * integral spots a little issue with the Trans monad

[21:40] <integral> ah, I think I know my mistake: I'm thinking the Stmt+Ins data structure is emitter specific, but maybe it's not?

[21:41] <integral> hmm, except that doesn't make sense when you consider than Translate is designed to output to different emitters, but if they all use Stmts, you only need one Translate (?) ?
