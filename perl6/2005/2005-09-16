[06:55] <nothingmuch> morning

[07:03] <GeJ> morning nm

[08:01] <gaal> hullo

[08:01] <nothingmuch> hi gaal 

[08:01] <gaal> heya nuffin!

[08:22] * nothingmuch thinks he finally has an approach to the type safety in blondie thing

[08:22] <nothingmuch> first reduce the tree to a type annotation tree

[08:23] <nothingmuch> with only the known types filled in (for pimitives)

[08:23] <nothingmuch> then do a depth first traversal of the tree, and apply the types upwards

[08:23] <nothingmuch> for example, &infix:<~> has the type (str, str -> str)

[08:24] <nothingmuch> in the context of an App this is taken apart

[08:24] <nothingmuch> the App gets the '->str' part

[08:24] <nothingmuch> and applies type enforcements on the args to the thunk

[08:25] <nothingmuch> for example a Val("\n") and a Sym('$string') in the &say reference implementation

[08:25] <nothingmuch> Sym is a bit funky - when traversing dowwards the DynamicScoping reducer subclass part knew to link it to the Param it belonds to

[08:26] <nothingmuch> the param then gets the type from the Sym, which is forced to be a 'str'

[08:27] <nothingmuch> any Seq (the only logical parent for a Param) will concatenate it's param childrens' types into it's own type

[08:27] <nothingmuch> so the parent seq is 'str -> <not yet known>' but we'll only know that when we go back to the seq

[08:28] <nothingmuch> the app on the ~ is resolved to 'str' and is then used in the app on &print

[08:28] <nothingmuch> at any point that there is enforcement of types and the types don't match the type checker asks the runtime to provide a conversion

[08:29] <nothingmuch> if one doesn't exist a compile time error is thrown

[08:31] <Juerd> morning

[08:31] <nothingmuch> hi Juerd 

[08:31] <Juerd> The coercion thread isn't quite growing as much as we expected

[08:31] <nothingmuch> neither are my threads =(

[08:34] <Juerd> Larry last responded a week ago. I hope he's alright

[08:35] <QtPlatypus> Where does Mr Wall live?

[08:35] <Juerd> a.galaxy.far.away

[08:35] <nothingmuch> somewhere in california

[08:35] <Juerd> That too

[08:35] <nothingmuch> i meant physically =)

[08:36] <Juerd> Life isn't physical.

[08:36] <Juerd> It has physical expression in some ways, but life itself can't be physical.

[08:36] * nothingmuch believes it is

[08:36] <Juerd> Then why can't we recreate it?

[08:37] <nothingmuch> unit structures that have the nice tendency to replicate are life

[08:37] <nothingmuch> because we aren't good enough chemists

[08:37] <Juerd> Why can't we, given a body that used to function nicely just a minute ago, resurrect?

[08:37] <nothingmuch> in this specific case we actually can, most of the time

[08:38] <nothingmuch> as i see it, WRT such complex forms of life there is simply a bootstrapping problem =)

[08:38] <Juerd> Not really.

[08:38] <Juerd> We can do this only when there's still actual life.

[08:38] * QtPlatypus relaxes "Was just worried that be may of lived in a hurracane affected area"

[08:38] <Juerd> When life is gone, we can't save someone anymore.

[08:39] <nothingmuch> well, to each his own

[08:39] * nothingmuch beleves there is no life in that sense... i see no line between myself and a piece of rock

[08:39] <nothingmuch> just a gradient

[08:40] <Juerd> I believe that life is radiation

[08:40] <nothingmuch> in what sense?

[08:40] <Juerd> And that telepathy is simply radio reception

[08:41] <Juerd> Except we have no way to detect this kind of radiation yet.

[08:41] <Juerd> Many identical twins stay telepathically connected, without them knowing so. There's lots of proof of this (or something like this)

[08:42] * nothingmuch sees no contradiction with his own model yet

[08:42] <Juerd> My theory is that they're just receiving each others life through these frequencies. Which aren't spatial.

[08:42] <nothingmuch> ah

[08:42] <Juerd> They're temporal, but omnipresent.

[08:42] <Juerd> Hard to explain.

[08:42] <webmind-> Juerd, you mean there is no distance ?

[08:43] <Juerd> There is distance

[08:43] <Juerd> This radiation isn't hindered by it, though.

[08:43] <Juerd> It doesn't have the first three dimensions.

[08:43] <QtPlatypus> Juerd: Have you heard of Zeno?

[08:43] <Juerd> QtPlatypus: No. How's he doing?

[08:44] <webmind-> Juerd, so for us then space is irrelevent ?

[08:44] <nothingmuch> heh, by coincidence i just followed a link to a page about Zeno

[08:44] <QtPlatypus> Juerd: He is dead. 

[08:44] <nothingmuch> perhaps QtPlatypus and I are twins ;-)

[08:44] <nothingmuch> http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Zeno_of_Elea.html

[08:44] <Juerd> webmind-: For our lives, yes. If your body dies, your life can be transferred to life somewhere else.

[08:44] <webmind-> how would you see this 'somewhere else' ?

[08:45] <QtPlatypus> Anyway Zeno was an anchent greek who beleaved that we where all at the same location and that space/distence was an illusion.

[08:45] <Juerd> webmind-: Literally.

[08:45] <nothingmuch> my opinion on the matter of soul and all that transendance stuff is that I have observed no other structure in nature that is this dichotomic, and thus I have no reason to believe that this one is too

[08:45] <Juerd> QtPlatypus: Not an illusion, afait.

[08:45] <Juerd> QtPlatypus: It's just that not everything has these dimensions

[08:45] <Juerd> Just like how a *moment* has no duration.

[08:46] <webmind-> Juerd, well yes.. but this would be for us an undetectable place?

[08:46] <Juerd> A thought has no distance or volume (volume not as amplitude)

[08:46] <webmind-> or not  yet discovered

[08:46] <Juerd> webmind-: There's no such thing as "place" for this.

[08:46] <Juerd> HOLY FUCK THAT WAS SCARY

[08:46] <webmind-> ?

[08:47] <Juerd> Lights went off.

[08:47] <webmind-> ah

[08:47] <webmind-> power failure ?

[08:47] <Juerd> It's just a power outage.

[08:47] <Juerd> Yeah, but it really frightened me. I dunno why.

[08:47] <nothingmuch> hehe

[08:47] <nothingmuch> our talk is becoming somewhat spiritual

[08:47] <Juerd> It's back up again even.

[08:47] <Juerd> UPS comes back now too.

[08:48] <Juerd> Okay, I desperately need a break.

[08:48] <Juerd> afk

[08:48] <QtPlatypus> Juerd: I think that thoughts are to brains as processes are to computers

[08:48] <nothingmuch> ciao

[08:49] <QtPlatypus> See yah

[09:47] <masak> poor Juerd, Zeno is obviously haunting him :)

[15:43] <kolibrie> gaal: nothingmuch was going to take some medium-format film photos, but I don't know how those came out

[15:46] <gaal> nothingmuch takes nice pictures

[15:47] <gaal> how expensive is newTVar?

[15:50] <gaal> I know I'm doing something wrong: in reducing the AST, i'm recreting a new TVar for the pragmas-in-effect for every node. why tvar? becuase that's what i had in Env for the other direction: installing pragmas at compile time. but it looks very weird to have two different slots for very similar information

[15:52] <gaal> grrrr, i suppose i'll generalize the compile-time->parser tvar, and indeed make the runtime member just the pragmas-in-effect list.

[22:01] <marshall> I'm rewriting an /etc/services file using a format, anyone know if there is a way to make a line in a format that starts with a '#' pound sign?

[22:01] <luqui> is that a perl 5 question?

[22:01] <marshall> ya

[22:01] <luqui> go ask in #perl then :-)

[22:02] <luqui> formats are gone in perl 6 (and I never really knew them to begin with)

[22:02] <marshall> thx

[22:02] <integral> luqui: There's dconway's Perl6::Form though, which are a bit like p5 formats

[22:03] * luqui tried to use Perl6::Form several times

[22:03] <luqui> it reminded me too much of formats :-)

[22:03] <luqui> I couldn't remember anything, so I'd have my face in the docs

[22:03] <luqui> not what I'd call "intuitive"

[22:04] <luqui> but, at least nobody's forcing us to use them... or anything for that matter

[22:04] * buu forces luqui to use perl4

[22:05] <luqui> heh, when did perl 5 come out?

[22:05] <luqui> '91?

[22:05] <buu> 94 I thought

[22:05] <luqui> okay

[22:05] <buu> That might be .6 though

[22:05] <luqui> I was 10 then

[22:05] <buu> Nice.

[22:05] <buu> So was I

[22:05] <buu> I think.

[22:05] <Khisanth> HMM no wonder there are people coming in here instead of #perl asking for perl5 help

[22:05] <luqui> por que?

[22:06] <buu> Khisanth: You're so slow =/

[22:06] <buu> 17:12 < buu> Oh, hrm. #perl is hidden from lists

[22:06] <buu> 17:12 < buu> No wonder people keep showing up here.

[22:06] <Khisanth> never noticed the modes and the last time I did /list it showed up since I was already in there

[22:07] <luqui> should #perl be hidden?

[22:07] <Khisanth> not sure :)

[22:07] <integral> it's always been iirc

[22:07] * luqui considers starting a #perl5 with topic "go to #perl, silly!"

[22:08] <Khisanth> ##perl! :P

[22:08] <integral> ###perl!

[22:09] <Khisanth> the unofficial channel for discussion about #perl? :P

[22:09] <buu> No

[22:09] <buu> It's the unofficial channel for discussion about unofficial discussion.

[22:22] <Supaplex> so, unoffically ... MEAHLAHRG!

[23:11] <coral> if there was a #perl5 that was as on topic as #perl6 is

[23:11] <coral> then that would be useful

[23:22] <buu> What is this "ontopic" you speak of?

[23:22] <buu> Besides, it would be a dead channel

[23:24] <coral> well, conversation here is generally about perl6

[23:24] <buu> Just like now!
