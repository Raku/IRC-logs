[00:42] <jabbot> pugs - 1581 - Added -s (but only for posix).  Correcte

[01:02] <jabbot> pugs - 1582 - test for bug when $_ is explictly the to

[01:15] <shapr> from #haskell - <dons> ghc patch of the day: "get the SMP mode at least building"

[01:16] <shapr> Pugs could have SMP support sooner than you expected.

[01:33] <crysflame> oo, nice

[03:06] <autrijus> greetings \camels

[03:07] <autrijus> I see a great influx of filetest operators :)

[03:07] <Schwern> -e!  -r!  -k!

[03:08] <autrijus> -p! -u! -g! -s!

[03:08] <Schwern> I know I've asked this before, but is the recommended book "Expression" or "Algorithms"?

[03:09] <autrijus> both.

[03:09] <autrijus> if you can only get one, Algorithms, I think

[03:09] <autrijus> but I've neve rreally read Expression.

[03:24] <Alias_> I want -c

[03:24] <Alias_> "Can I create a file called $foo"

[03:24] <Khisanth> I want autrijus clones :p

[03:25] <Alias_> or just -o

[03:25] <Alias_> Can I open the file $foo for writing

[03:25] <Alias_> Which requires either -w if it exists or -c if not

[03:25] <Khisanth> hmm

[03:25] <Khisanth> Alias_: open() seems more reliable

[03:26] <Alias_> But open _actually_ opens the file

[03:26] <Alias_> Say I have a manifest of files to install, I want to know before I start that I have permissions on all of them

[03:26] <Alias_> Rather than getting half way through, and failing

[03:27] <Alias_> otherwise we wouldn't need -r

[03:27] <Alias_> "just open the file"

[03:27] <Alias_> or -w, "just open (and clobber) the file"

[03:27] <Alias_> or any of the file test operators

[03:27] <Alias_> "just do it and see if everything dies in a mess" is not a good solution to writing a test

[03:28] <autrijus> what does -c has to do with nonexisting file?

[03:28] <Khisanth> -c(reate)?

[03:30] <Alias_> yes

[03:30] <Alias_> I'm assuming there is no existing -c

[03:31] <Khisanth> -c  File is a character special file. ?

[03:31] <Alias_> oh... never mind then

[03:31] <Alias_> I just want a "can I open this path for write, regardless of current state"

[03:32] <Khisanth> -r|-w ?

[03:32] <Alias_> what if there is no current file

[03:32] <autrijus> then you can't safely check that.

[03:33] <Alias_> of course you can

[03:33] <autrijus> because there may be a dynamic ACL thing in place.

[03:33] <Alias_> You see if the directory exists, and if you have permissions to create on the directory

[03:33] <autrijus> but assuming traditional unix semantics, maybe you can check for -w on the directory.

[03:33] <Alias_> and if the dir doesn't exist, you want to work upwards until you find one that you can, so you can mkpath :)

[03:34] <Alias_> Anyways, it's a hell of a lot of mess to answer, "can I open( FILE, '>file' ) ok?"

[03:34] <autrijus> and you have to check for disk inodes to see if they're foo :)

[03:34] <autrijus> s/foo/full/

[03:34] <Alias_> autrijus: Like most installers do, yes :)

[03:36] <autrijus> lunch &

[03:53] <Alias_> Does pugs have enough stuff to start investigating the real life issues relating to cross-language modules?

[03:53] <Alias_> Can we mix Haskell and Perl 6-targetted stuff together or something similar?

[03:59] * Khisanth never saw the point in that

[03:59] <mugwump> I am at the top of Taipei101, the world's tallest building!

[04:00] <mugwump> and using IRC!  :)

[04:00] <Khisanth> "you mean I have to install Python, Ruby AND Perl just to run this thing?!"

[04:00] <Khisanth> wireless? :p

[04:01] <Alias_> Khisanth: I'm kind of hoping that at some point, probably at install time, you can also install a Parrot-compiled version of the same code

[04:01] <mugwump> sadly, just GPRS 

[04:01] <Alias_> Khisanth: Languages load their own native libs, but bail out to the generic Parrot version for non-native libs

[04:04] <mugwump> well, you can eval_perl5() from pugs iirc

[04:04] <Alias_> oh dear... evalling would be a problem wouldn't it

[04:04] <mugwump> also, pugs can run IMC code as well as PASM

[04:05] <Alias_> you couldn't precompile evals

[04:05] <Alias_> So you are definitely going to need pluggable grammars for all the languages

[04:05] <Alias_> I wonder how large an individual grammar will be

[04:05] <mugwump> there are no calling conventions for the Perl5 <=> perl6 bridge

[04:05] <Alias_> Damn this is going to make the Inline modules interesting though

[04:06] <Alias_> If the Inline'ed language has a native grammar, you just hand off to it

[04:06] <mugwump> have a look at the source in pugs for the IMC  parser, it's laughably simple

[04:06] <Alias_> If it's written in Haskell, then I disagree :)

[04:06] <Alias_> IMC?

[04:06] <mugwump> Parsec++

[04:08] <mugwump> The language isn't the problem.  It's more the style of programming using rules

[04:14] <mugwump> it seems inside out and this is quite a shock especially to someone who thinks they have seen / discovered every programming style... even I was rrecently forced to concede that maybe those functional guys had a point :)

[04:20] <Alias_> mugwump: Yeah. I've been sold on Haskell just on the idea of getting partial evaluation as a core language feature

[04:21] <Alias_> If only I can get my head compatible with it's evil evil syntax :)

[04:21] <Alias_> But hot damn, if we can get access to Haskell modules in Perl 6 I'll be a happy chappy

[04:21] <mugwump> I'm getting good milage from "two Dozen short lessons"

[04:21] <Alias_> I'm working on this demo wiki page of shapr's

[04:21] <Alias_> And editing as I go to make it more friendly

[04:22] <Alias_> ... for camels at least

[04:23] <mugwump> sounds good... tell me more later :)

[04:23] * mugwump & # leaving Taipei101

[04:30] <Khisanth> package keyword no longer in p6?

[04:37] <Alias_> Khisanth: "package" is how P6 will detect a P5 file. P6 itself will use 'class' or 'module'(in some cases)

[04:38] <Khisanth> Alias_: that is the reason I asked

[04:39] <Alias_> so... yes. No package keyword

[04:40] <Khisanth> hmm maybe I'll just go through all the A, E and S first :)

[04:43] <Schwern> Alias:  Wait... is "package" going to be Perl 5 code or just a Perl 5-style class?

[04:45] <Khisanth> a module that contains package is p5

[04:45] <Alias_> It indicates to the parser to use the Perl 5 grammar instead of the Perl 6 grammar. I swear I've read that half a dozen times

[04:45] <Khisanth> still reading about the regular program stuff :)

[04:45] <Alias_> So it's PONIE code

[04:46] <Schwern> Huh.  That's new to me.

[04:46] <Schwern> Apoc 12 continues to describe things as "packages" but it doesn't use the keyword in code anywhere.

[04:47] <Alias_> Let me finish this merge and I'll look

[04:57] <Alias_> http://search.cpan.org/~ingy/Perl6-Bible-0.12/lib/Perl6/Bible/A01.pod

[04:57] <Alias_> HAlfway down

[04:58] <Alias_> search for "package"

[04:58] <Alias_> "I hereby declare that a package declaration at the front of a file unambiguously indicates you are parsing Perl 5 code"

[04:58] <Schwern> I don't know, that's kind of ambiguous.

[04:59] <Alias_> Rule 1

[04:59] <Schwern> I'm kidding.

[04:59] <Alias_> I know :)

[04:59] <Alias_> Had a chance to look through stuff yet?

[05:05] <gaal> Windows--; # pop up a dialog box when a segfault occurs, thus stopping automatic smoke tests that expose hard bugs

[05:08] <gaal> theorbtwo, you there?

[05:16] <theorbtwo> Mornin, all.

[05:18] <gaal> hey theorbtwo. i just noticed the testgraph script isn't compatible with 5.6.1. mind if i hack at it?

[05:19] <gaal> unhappily, the problem is with unicode layers, which suggests there may be problems even if the syntax is fixed :(

[05:20] <theorbtwo> Ugh.

[05:20] <theorbtwo> Sure, go for it.

[05:20] <theorbtwo> Sadly, YAML doesn't just do it right.

[05:20] <gaal> ....anyone remember how to spell ":utf8" in 5.6? :)

[05:20] <theorbtwo> Note that the output is ASCII -- I just HTML-escape the unicode characters.

[05:20] <gaal> huh? what doesn't it do right?

[05:20] <gaal> oh :(

[05:21] <gaal> so there's no need to claim utf8ness, anyway.

[05:21] <theorbtwo> I can't just say "open this file, please", to YAML, and it will open the files.

[05:21] <theorbtwo> Except some of the tests output utf8.

[05:21] <theorbtwo> (In purticular, the length tests.)

[05:21] <gaal> LoadFile

[05:21] <gaal> it's not exported by default

[05:21] <theorbtwo> Yes, bu that fails to be unicode-clean.

[05:21] <gaal> yeah, i wrote those :/

[05:21] <theorbtwo> I did that first.

[05:22] <jabbot> pugs - 1585 - * disable perlego tests completely

[05:22] <jabbot> pugs - 1584 - * hangman.p6 now reads from AUTHORS dire

[05:22] <jabbot> pugs - 1583 - * add Chpi and Anton to AUTHORS

[05:22] <Khisanth> gaal: binmode?

[05:22] <gaal> i don't mind requiring YAML 0.39 if it fixes the problem (hint, hint ingy)

[05:25] <gaal> why are you making ascii out instead of utf-8?

[05:25] <theorbtwo> I'd prefer very much that the YAML modules be charset-sane, rather then requiring the user to be, such as by encoding the charset on the first few lines, before any data.

[05:26] <theorbtwo> Because it creates less issues.

[05:26] <gaal> for browsers, you mean?

[05:26] <theorbtwo> I don't have to worry about the browser actually supporting utf8 correctly, I don't have to worry if it's marked as utf8 correctly.

[05:26] <theorbtwo> Yeah.

[05:26] <theorbtwo> It's also dead easy to implement.

[05:26] <gaal> that's usually not a problem in this day and age....

[05:26] <theorbtwo> That half shouldn't have problems at all under 5.6.

[05:27] <gaal> true

[05:27] <gaal> well, not true

[05:27] <gaal> if i work in character mode

[05:27] <gaal> i can't just convert stuff to html entities

[05:27] <gaal> because i'll read an octet at a time

[05:27] <theorbtwo> Why not, and what do you mean by character mode?

[05:27] <theorbtwo> Oh, you mean in bytes mode.

[05:27] <gaal> sorry, bytes mode, yes.

[05:28] <theorbtwo> Do that line in a {use utf8; } block, then.

[05:28] <theorbtwo> Or, if that won't work, then admit that it's impossible to get it to work if you use bytes.

[05:29] <gaal> yes, and write a minimal utf-8 scanner. the fun!

[05:29] <gaal> while $byte & 80 get_another_one();

[05:30] <theorbtwo> I didn't think 5.6 utf8 was /that/ broken...

[05:30] <gaal> well, i'll look into it.

[05:32] <jabbot> pugs - 1587 - * add Adam Preble to AUTHORS

[05:32] <jabbot> pugs - 1586 - * do not set heap limit to 200m, as it c

[05:37] <gaal> incidentally - does this page come up with properl css? http://forum2.org/gaal/pugs/tests_xp.html - my browser refuses to refresh the css, for some reason

[05:41] <gaal> beh - it looks as if unicode support in 5.6.1 was, indeed, "that broken".

[05:41] <gaal> how bad do we want the smoke system to support 5.6.1?

[05:41] <gaal> pugs itself works fine, so it's a pity to leave it behind;

[05:42] <jabbot> pugs - 1591 - * .kv implemented on arrays and hashes t

[05:42] <jabbot> pugs - 1590 - * remove -H200m from Perl6::MakeMaker to

[05:42] <jabbot> pugs - 1589 - * exit() now triggers END{} too.

[05:42] <jabbot> pugs - 1588 - * minor edit to drop unneccessary qualif

[05:42] <gaal> but working around utf8 shortcomings just for the test system is... weird.

[05:42] <gaal> does exit() trigger END{} in p5?

[05:42] <autrijus> it does.

[05:46] <gaal> theorbtwo, you should really get the css on testgraph to work on msie (mousehover doesn't, currently). this is quite the thing to show bosses at work :)

[05:46] <theorbtwo> Oh, I thought it was...

[05:46] * gaal is quiety pushing TDD

[05:46] <theorbtwo> Anyway, I see that page without css.

[05:47] <theorbtwo> Which is odd, because if I just load the CSS page, it loads OK.

[05:47] <nothingmuch> theorbtwo: `works?

[05:47] <gaal> i see it with css on msie

[05:47] <theorbtwo> I see  http://forum2.org/gaal/pugs/tests_xp.html as if it had no CSS on FF.

[05:47] <nothingmuch> i see it with css, but it looks too red

[05:48] * autrijus resumes the "fix broken tests" coding monkey role :)

[05:48] * nothingmuch goes to the doctor

[05:48] <gaal> the server logs don't give any errors on the css file

[05:49] <theorbtwo> The CSS loads with a content-type of text/plain, though.

[05:49] <theorbtwo> Note that the coloration of the last column is based on style="" attributes, not on the CSS file.

[05:49] <gaal> ugh

[05:49] <nothingmuch> perhaps testgraph.pl should have a content type in the <link>

[05:50] <theorbtwo> That quietly implies that somebody can't replace our stylesheet with another one that isn't CSS, but that's OK with me.

[05:51] <theorbtwo> gaal, try adding C< type="text/css" > to the link tag at the top?

[05:52] <gaal> try again please

[05:54] <theorbtwo> No visible change.

[05:54] <theorbtwo> Most odd.

[05:54] <gaal> btw there are inconsistent newlines there.

[05:55] <theorbtwo> In the HTML output?

[05:55] <gaal> yeah - the header that testgraph generates vs. the rest

[06:18] <theorbtwo> gaal, if you just change the syntax to open then binmode, what goes wrong?

[06:18] * theorbtwo doesn't have a handy copy of 5.6.

[06:22] <theorbtwo> Odd, the forum2.org testgraph shows a lot more red then the run I just did.

[06:23] <sdtr443w> Do complicated returns work in Pugs?

[06:24] <gaal> whoops, was taking a shower and am now off to $work. see you in a few.

[06:25] <theorbtwo> See you in a bit, gaal.

[06:36] * castaway_ snuggles theorbtwo

[06:37] <theorbtwo> *kiss*

[06:38] *** castaway_ is now known as castaway

[06:41] <hattmoward> disgusting!

[06:41] <castaway> ahh shurrup hatt

[06:41] <rgs> :)

[07:11] <nothingmuch>  castaway, theorbtwo: is it working?

[07:11] <nothingmuch> errm... context context context

[07:11] <nothingmuch> not the relationship, i mean

[07:11] <nothingmuch> the SEE session

[07:11] <nothingmuch> i typoed the port number

[07:13] <castaway> No

[07:13] <castaway> telnet woobling.org 6944 -> nada

[07:13] * castaway grins tho

[07:13] <castaway> ah *now* it does, ta :)

[07:14] <nothingmuch> huraah

[07:14] * nothingmuch can now sleep at night

[07:14] <castaway> :)

[07:14] <castaway> Until we crash it by sending it junk :)

[07:14] <castaway> I'm betting its not very stable

[07:15] <nothingmuch> feel free to crash it, i'll try to run it in a loop

[07:15] <nothingmuch> anyway, time to go to work

[07:15] <nothingmuch> and maybe pharmacy

[07:15] <castaway> Okie.. thanks!

[07:15] <nothingmuch> btw, i think it's easiest if i give you shell acces

[07:15] <nothingmuch> and you control it with osascript

[07:15] <castaway> that would be nifty ,)

[07:15] <nothingmuch> to create new docs, and stuff

[07:15] <theorbtwo> That'd be quite nifty.

[07:15] <castaway> umm, assuming we knew osascript

[07:15] <nothingmuch> it's very simple

[07:15] <castaway> but I guess theorbtwo would like to play with it

[07:15] <theorbtwo> (Of course, it'd require learning osascript, and SEE's osascripting model, assuming it has one.)

[07:16] <nothingmuch> ok, i'll set that up when I get back home

[07:16] <nothingmuch> osascript is peanut

[07:16] <nothingmuch> s

[07:16] <castaway> funky

[07:16] <nothingmuch> and see's model is probably a bit more complex

[07:16] <theorbtwo> I should think it would be.

[07:16] <nothingmuch> but there's ref

[07:16] <theorbtwo> But I have no idea if SEE exposes an osascripting interface.

[07:16] <nothingmuch> it does

[07:16] <nothingmuch> see autrijus' kwiki hack

[07:17] <theorbtwo> Oh, I should probably read that at some point.

[07:17] <nothingmuch> it's really just: SEE, open this file, and let everyone play with it

[07:17] <nothingmuch> and then at some point save it (dunno when)

[07:17] <nothingmuch> ciao!

[07:18] * castaway waves at nothingmuch 

[07:18] <theorbtwo> Later!

[07:56] <theorbtwo> Hm, is there a way to add an instance of show to an imported type, or to fake show?

[08:05] <castaway> hmm, wheres all the lambda-ites?

[08:11] <nothingmuch> on #haskell ;-)

[08:14] <iblech> (me at school ATM) autrijus: saw your commit of kv.t -- if I understood S29 correctly: .kv returns an AoA (array of [key, value]). .pairs returns an AoP (array of Pair.new(key => ..., value => ...)). Might be wrong, though

[08:14] * iblech heads to next lession

[08:15] <nothingmuch> oh my, why should .kv do that?

[08:16] <Schwern> Why do we need two different operators?

[08:17] <xkb_> hi

[08:18] <theorbtwo> Note that S29 isn't even vaugely firm yet.

[08:19] <Schwern> The signatures on the functions in S29 frighten me

[08:19] <Schwern>  multi sub log (: Num ?$x = $CALLER::_, Num +$base) returns Num

[08:19] <Khisanth> remove more water?

[08:20] <Khisanth> Schwern: line noise? :)

[08:20] <Alias_> pretty much

[08:20] <theorbtwo> Wait a second... so log(10) means the log of $_, base 10, and not the log of 10, base defaulted (to 10).

[08:20] <Schwern> Khisanth:  Seems a little... verbose and compact at the same time

[08:20] <Khisanth> I thought p6 was suppose to be less and not more :p

[08:21] <Khisanth> though I really don't see any problem with reading that

[08:21] <Alias_> Khisanth: It's "more" strictly types, and you'll be "less" aware it's happening

[08:21] <Alias_> typed

[08:21] * Alias_ goes home

[08:21] <theorbtwo> p5 is very strictly typed: The types are $, @, %, *, and &.

[08:21] <Schwern> Though I do like how log10 is implemented

[08:21] <Khisanth> although the problem is always with writing and not reading when it comes to verbosity

[08:22] <Khisanth> Schwern: currying?

[08:22] <theorbtwo> p6 is a bit more loosely typed, and certianly more obvious in it's typing.

[08:23] <theorbtwo> The lambdites on #haskell don't seem all that awake either.

[08:23] <Schwern> Why do we have 25 trig functions in the core?

[08:24] <Schwern> That all belongs in a module

[08:24] <theorbtwo> I think the idea is to specify them first, then decide what goes in a module and what doesn't.

[08:24] <Schwern> Fair nuff

[08:25] <Khisanth> just make sure p6 does not become PHP :)

[08:25] <Schwern> zip doesn't do what I expect.

[08:25] <Schwern> Though it was just a flattening operator

[08:26] <Schwern> thought

[08:26] <Khisanth> iterate over multiple lists in parallel?

[08:26] <nothingmuch> for (zip(@a; @b)) -> $a, $b { }

[08:26] <nothingmuch> to iterate two lists together

[08:26] <Schwern> Example: zip (1,4,7,10 ; 2,5,8,11 ; 3,6) generates (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,undef,10,11,undef)

[08:26] <Schwern> Oh

[08:26] <Schwern> What a horrible example

[08:27] * nothingmuch wonders in how many places like multiple iteration vars perl6 obeys the 0, 1, ∞ rule

[08:27] <castaway> 0,1,what?

[08:27] <nothingmuch> Inf

[08:27] <nothingmuch> http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TwoIsAnImpossibleNumber

[08:28] <castaway> hmm, was that urf8?

[08:28] <nothingmuch> yup

[08:28] <castaway> utf8 even

[08:28] * nothingmuch is always utf8, because hebrew is too crazy in any other encoding

[08:28] <castaway> odd, thats what Im set to display :(

[08:28] <theorbtwo> Yey!

[08:28] <theorbtwo> Too crazy why, though?

[08:28] <theorbtwo> The lack of vowel marks?

[08:28] <nothingmuch> logical order

[08:29] <nothingmuch> vs visual order

[08:29] <theorbtwo> Ah.

[08:29] <nothingmuch> clash of latin space with hebrew space in many encodings

[08:29] <nothingmuch> can't have å with hebrew

[08:29] <theorbtwo> Um, do you often want to?

[08:29] <nothingmuch> and since I tend to communicate in english, sometimes with umlauty people, and hebrew, i get that

[08:29] <nothingmuch> for mom it's even more important

[08:29] <theorbtwo> Ah.

[08:30] <nothingmuch> she is a german speaker

[08:30] <nothingmuch> it's just annoying to see a name like Wünsch become something with hebrew in it

[08:30] * theorbtwo thinks that the Germans should just start actually using the ue form.

[08:30] <theorbtwo> Wuensch.

[08:31] <nothingmuch> http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ZeroOneInfinityRule is actually a much better discussion of the topic

[08:32] * nothingmuch thinks that a language should have only Infinity, but within that Infinity 0, 1, and sometimes 2 should make sense

[08:32] <nothingmuch> except for reasonable exceptions like hash key -> value mappings represented as pairs, or things like that

[08:32] <Khisanth> what about things like Infinity squared? :)

[08:33] <nothingmuch> still infinity, Khisanth ;-)(

[08:33] <Schwern> nothingmuch:  key -> value mappings are still one.  One pair.

[08:33] <nothingmuch> Schwern: yes, i agree. That's also how I see them

[08:34] * nothingmuch ponders a review of this

[08:34] <nothingmuch> i think one of the hardest places to make this work is parameter binding

[08:34] <nothingmuch> btw, the log thing:

[08:34] <Schwern> Let us all remember that we'll never need more than 640K or 32K rows in a spreadsheet.

[08:35] <nothingmuch> it reads: log without arguments puts $_ in $x

[08:35] <Schwern> That 32K limit is STILL in Excel, ran into it last year.

[08:35] <nothingmuch> log with 1 arg puts the arg in x

[08:35] <nothingmuch> oh my

[08:36] <nothingmuch> log with two args puts first in x, second in base

[08:36] <nothingmuch> log(:base(2)) is like log2($_)

[08:36] <nothingmuch> etc, etc, etc

[08:37] <Schwern> Why not just log(2, 10)  (log of 2 base 10)

[08:38] <nothingmuch> Schwern: s/Why not just//;

[08:38] <Schwern> So what's log(:base(2)) ?

[08:38] <Schwern> Don't tell me :foo(N) is what named args look like

[08:38] <nothingmuch> it just says "this parameter, the one i'm giving you, is named"

[08:38] <Schwern> Eww

[08:39] <nothingmuch> :foo(2) is the same as (foo => 2)

[08:39] <Schwern> So log(base => 2) still works?

[08:39] <nothingmuch> ofcourse

[08:39] <Schwern> Good.  :foo(2) looks too much like a function call

[08:41] <castaway> Schwern, in 2003 ?

[08:41] <castaway> at least in PivotTables in 2003 the limit increased hugely.. havent tested simple spreadsheet lines yet though

[08:41] <Schwern> In 2005 even

[08:41] <Schwern> Oh, Excel

[08:41] <Schwern> No idea

[08:41] * Schwern snaps into context

[08:42] <castaway> at, 65k rows now

[08:42] <Schwern> I just know we were generating 40K+ row spreadsheets that were giving Excel heartburn.

[08:42] <castaway> s/at/ah/

[08:42] <nothingmuch> a /whole/ 65k?

[08:42] <castaway> yeah ,)

[08:42] <Schwern> Ahh, we were hitting 80K

[08:43] <castaway> (bloody stupid no, why not liimit by memory like most of the rest..)

[08:43] <Schwern> It was each bid on 44K properties in Miami/Dade county.

[08:43] <Schwern> So 1..N rows for each property

[08:43] <Schwern> castaway:  Has to do with the way the Excel file format was done.

[08:44] <nothingmuch> so basically it was the result of a join?

[08:44] <nothingmuch> i have a page long SQL query I make an excel table out of

[08:44] <nothingmuch> same feeling

[08:44] <Schwern> nothingmuch:  More or less

[08:44] <nothingmuch> fortunately it's around 1k at the moment

[08:45] <castaway> Schwern: then they should change it.. its not as if they havent already made bits incompatible ,)

[08:46] <Schwern> castaway:  Here it is from the Open Office viewpoint.  http://sc.openoffice.org/row-limit.html

[08:46] <theorbtwo> The problem is that people would create too-long spreadsheets, then try to save them, and get pissed as all hell.

[08:47] <Schwern> Though it looks like OOo just shot themselves in the foot for the hell of it.

[08:49] <Khisanth> some people enjoy pain ;)

[08:49] * nothingmuch thinks excel is fundamentally flawed for any data set more than 4-5 times the size a human can fit in their brain

[08:49] <nothingmuch> auto-filter raises this to 10-15 times, perhaps

[08:49] <Schwern> castaway:  Looking further I can't really say if the limit is in the Excel document format or not

[08:50] <Schwern> castaway:  Or if MS is staring at the same sort of type upgrade hell that OO.org is.

[08:50] <Schwern> Perl 6 has a simple Number type, RIGHT?!

[08:50] <Khisanth> simpler than scalar?

[08:50] <Schwern> Integers are -Inf to Inf, right?

[08:50] <nothingmuch> Schwern: Num

[08:50] <theorbtwo> IIRC, it has a Num role, which everything that can be a number can do.

[08:50] <nothingmuch> i think

[08:51] <Schwern> Numbers upgrade to bignums seemlessly, all that good stuff

[08:51] <Schwern> None of this 3.298984144e48 crap

[08:51] <theorbtwo> I think this is supposed to be the case, though I am unsure if it is the case in pugs.

[08:51] <nothingmuch> it probably is

[08:51] <nothingmuch> haskell has bignums out of the box

[08:51] <Schwern> Nope

[08:52] <Schwern> $ perl6 -wle 'print 2**64'

[08:52] <Schwern> 1.8446744073709552e19

[08:52] <nothingmuch> that's horrible!

[08:52] * nothingmuch writes a test

[08:52] <Schwern> cavet, that was r11xx

[08:53] <theorbtwo> Does the same on mine, which is up-to-date.

[08:53] <theorbtwo> BTW, -l is a no-op, you wanted "say".

[08:53] <Schwern> Also try showing a number

[08:54] <Schwern> Oh, say

[08:54] <theorbtwo> (-w is also a no-op, but I'd keep typing it anyway if I were you.)

[08:54] <autrijus> greetings.

[08:55] <theorbtwo> Allo, autrijus!

[08:55] * clkao waves at autrijus

[08:55] <autrijus> perl6 does not have a simple number type.

[08:55] <autrijus> hey clkao 

[08:55] <theorbtwo> Is there a way I can derive show on a DynamicModule without editing the source of DynamicModule?

[08:55] <Khisanth> clkao: finished moving already?

[08:55] <autrijus> theorbtwo: sure!

[08:56] <theorbtwo> How?

[08:56] <autrijus> instance Show DynamicModule where show (RTM name path) = show (name, path)

[08:56] <autrijus> put it anywhere you want

[08:57] <clkao> Khisanth: just touched down, not finisehd yet.

[08:58] <theorbtwo> src/External/Haskell.hs:22:40: Not in scope: data constructor `RTM'

[08:58] <autrijus> Schwern: ** gives a Num context

[08:58] <Schwern> Norm!

[08:58] <autrijus> Schwern: if you want bignum, give it a int contxt

[08:58] <xkb_> Is all conversation here about pugs?

[08:58] <Schwern> autrijus:  It should dwim

[08:58] <autrijus> $ ./pugs -e 'say int 2**644'

[08:58] <autrijus> 72999049881955123498258745691204661198291656115976958889267080286388402675338838184094604981077942396458276953177510516971019275542007007972042581115555427012031914789764239201325987075945660416

[08:58] <xkb_> where do pugs and parrot meet?

[08:58] <nothingmuch> autrijus: why isn't Num by default an Int until it needs to be a rat?

[08:58] <theorbtwo> In the PAST.

[08:59] <Schwern> Nums should upgrade to bignums, too

[08:59] <autrijus> nothingmuch: a Rat is BigRat anyway

[08:59] <nothingmuch> float, whatever

[08:59] <autrijus> nothingmuch: it preserves everything

[08:59] <autrijus> it's just the stringification.

[08:59] <nothingmuch> the stringification is where the user is

[08:59] <nothingmuch> the user is the most important part of a system

[09:00] <autrijus> eh sure.

[09:00] <autrijus> AST.hs line 190

[09:00] <autrijus>     vCast (VRat r)      = showNum $ (realToFrac r :: Double)

[09:00] <nothingmuch> IMHO if it looks like an int it should be printed out as such

[09:00] <autrijus> currently we show rationals by casting it to Num.

[09:00] <autrijus> feel free to just fix it.

[09:00] <nothingmuch> ok

[09:00] <autrijus> hi Daniel_Nee!

[09:00] <Schwern> xkb:  Pugs is a stand alone Perl 6 interpreter written in Haskell.  It can also optionally compile Perl 6 code to Parrot and excute it using Parrot.

[09:00] <autrijus> xkb_: "pugscc --runparrot examples/mandel.p6"

[09:00] <nothingmuch> would the fix look like if (int(x) == x) { cast to int } else  { cast to rat }?

[09:00] <Daniel_Nee> Hi, Autrijus !

[09:01] <autrijus> nothingmuch: I have no idea. maybe you want arbitary precision fractional too

[09:01] <nothingmuch> i don't know

[09:01] <nothingmuch> either way, i have to find time first

[09:01] <autrijus> 1.42857142857142857 (ad infinitum)

[09:01] <autrijus> Schwern: ideas?

[09:02] <Schwern> About what to do with "print 1/3"?

[09:02] <jabbot> pugs - 1592 - bignum test

[09:02] <theorbtwo> You could even have it stringify 1/3 to "1/3", but I'd prefer that it stringify to a simple literal, unless pragmatified otherwise.

[09:03] <Schwern> bignum.pm deals with it by putting a default limit on it

[09:03] <autrijus> haskell's Rat indeed stringifies to 1%3.

[09:03] <autrijus> but not thinking we're going that way.

[09:03] <theorbtwo> Using % is asking for user-confusion.

[09:03] <nothingmuch> not only that

[09:03] <autrijus> not sure 1/3 is better.

[09:03] <nothingmuch> that's a bad thing, imho

[09:03] <theorbtwo> Even more then using engineering notation.

[09:03] <nothingmuch> but anything per outputs for the user should be edible by a pipe

[09:03] <theorbtwo> It's a hair better.

[09:04] <nothingmuch> you don't want to say $rat.as("%f")

[09:04] <nothingmuch> you want to just say $rat

[09:04] <autrijus> Schwern: ok. so for non-Inf integral parts, we show it even it's 9999999 digits?

[09:04] <nothingmuch> and have "... | poison_rats" work

[09:04] <Schwern> $ perl -Mbignum -wle 'print 1/3'

[09:04] <Schwern> 0.3333333333333333333333333333333333333333

[09:05] <nothingmuch> lets formulate some rules:

[09:05] <nothingmuch> no data loss, if possible

[09:05] <Schwern> I'd parrot what bignum does and consult Tels on the subject.

[09:05] <nothingmuch> backwards compatiblilty in notational format, more important than data loss

[09:05] <theorbtwo> +(~($x)) == $x

[09:05] <nothingmuch> (1/3 is 0.33, not 1/3)

[09:05] <autrijus> theorbtwo: then 0.3333 does not do what you want

[09:05] <nothingmuch> machine limits, mostly in the pass are not an issue

[09:06] <nothingmuch> that is, 2^75 is an int

[09:06] <nothingmuch> everything is presented in it's simplests backwards compatible format

[09:06] <nothingmuch> i.e., an int is an int

[09:06] <theorbtwo> Yes, the rule I gave is impossible to fufill in all cases.

[09:06] <autrijus> theorbtwo: don't just RTM then

[09:06] <nothingmuch> and we could have a pragma to print out wittier formats

[09:07] <nothingmuch> like sci notation where applicable

[09:07] <nothingmuch> and fractions

[09:07] <Schwern> autrijus:  For *display* not sure.

[09:07] <nothingmuch> and maybe even π etc

[09:07] <autrijus>     where show mod = dm_path mod

[09:07] <autrijus> that should do

[09:07] <nothingmuch> but then we also need to be able to parse such notations

[09:07] <autrijus> it's already parsed.

[09:07] <nothingmuch> (which is somthing i've always wanted in perl)

[09:08] <nothingmuch> +("1/3") -> ?

[09:08] <nothingmuch> pugs> "1/3" + 1

[09:08] <nothingmuch> 2.0

[09:08] <theorbtwo> I'd prefer that the stringification not imply accuracy that is not present.

[09:08] <nothingmuch> that's not what I meant

[09:09] <nothingmuch> 0.333 is not 1/3

[09:09] <nothingmuch> it's 0.333

[09:09] <nothingmuch> but 1/3 is 1/3

[09:09] <autrijus> pugs -e' 1 + '1/3'.eval

[09:09] <nothingmuch> is that what you mean?

[09:09] <nothingmuch> autrijus: i'm not going to eval everything the user chucks at me

[09:10] <nothingmuch> i want slightly smarter *number* not expression parsing

[09:10] <nothingmuch> although technically 1/3 is an expression, most people think of it as a number

[09:10] <nothingmuch> arguably -3 is the expression 0-3, too

[09:11] <theorbtwo> Oh; it already does what I was about to fault it for not doing -- ~5e60 is "5.0e60"; it doesn't form an intermediate float and then round it.

[09:11] <nothingmuch> btw, 1/3 notation is *not* processed by anything on CPAN

[09:11] <nothingmuch> i have a SoPW on that somewhere

[09:11] <autrijus> nothingmuch: I'm very not sure about processing "2004/12" as a nmber.

[09:12] <nothingmuch> where I tried to use Math::Expr, etc

[09:12] <autrijus> I am very very not sure indeed.

[09:12] <autrijus> certainly not as a builtin.

[09:12] <nothingmuch> if it's a date it shouldn't be numified

[09:12] <autrijus> why is 1/3 not a date and 2004/12 one?

[09:12] <nothingmuch> it should stay a string

[09:12] <nothingmuch> or be parsed as such

[09:12] <nothingmuch> both are

[09:12] <nothingmuch> and both aren't

[09:12] <autrijus> eh.

[09:12] <nothingmuch> i meant, if the user has $date = "2004/12"

[09:12] <nothingmuch> then the user shouldn't $date++

[09:13] <autrijus> why?

[09:13] <nothingmuch> without making it into a date object that properly overloads ++

[09:13] <autrijus> I want "2004/13"

[09:13] <autrijus> that's what perl's ++ always offered.

[09:13] <nothingmuch> hmm

[09:13] <autrijus> and I'd like int($date) to be "2004"

[09:13] <autrijus> not 167.

[09:13] <nothingmuch> i forgot about magical

[09:13] <nothingmuch> but then in 19 you get...?

[09:14] <autrijus> 20 of course

[09:14] <nothingmuch> perl -e 'my $a = "2004/12"; print ++$a'

[09:14] <nothingmuch> 2005

[09:14] <nothingmuch> it's not automagical

[09:14] <nothingmuch> it numifies

[09:15] <nothingmuch> ok, again, perhaps there should be  a pragma for more eager numification

[09:15] <nothingmuch> since it's bound to be done lexically

[09:15] <nothingmuch> damn, generalized tainting again

[09:15] <autrijus> sure. feel free to write a module :)

[09:15] <nothingmuch> strings that are slurped in the context of that lexical pragma will be numified smartly later

[09:15] <nothingmuch> even if they're spliced a bit

[09:16] <nothingmuch> i want generalized tainting SOOOOO much

[09:18] * nothingmuch will bring it up again

[09:19] <nothingmuch> i think it's the only sane way to get implicit behavior done right, leaking properly, in a well defined way

[09:24] <autrijus> ok.

[09:25] <autrijus> the integer part is of infinite precision

[09:25] <autrijus> it's 40 place of precision after the dot

[09:55] <nothingmuch> theorbtwo: IMHO: yes.

[09:55] <autrijus> theorbtwo: sure. -- L<>

[09:56] <nothingmuch> as an intergral part of PA02

[09:56] <autrijus> my current focus though is on fixing bugs and get multidim working for 6.20.

[09:56] <autrijus> err, 6.2.0

[09:56] <autrijus> so feel free to help me adding L<>

[09:58] <nothingmuch> horraaah!

[09:59] <nothingmuch> i want vimcoloring though

[09:59] <nothingmuch> i wonder if i can pull it off eventually

[10:00] * theorbtwo wonders if he'll get energetic enough at some port to set up non-vim-based coloring.

[10:00] <autrijus> Text::VimColor?

[10:00] <theorbtwo> Hm, I wonder if I can convince pugs to dump it's parse tree complete with coordinates, and use that for syntax coloring.

[10:01] <nothingmuch> autrijus: takes perl6.vim and probably haskell.vim

[10:01] <nothingmuch> and uses them to color the outputs

[10:01] <autrijus> both are there.

[10:02] <nothingmuch> i think editors should have embedded perl6 support

[10:02] <nothingmuch> that way macros could be parsed sanely

[10:02] <nothingmuch> that would be treees cool

[10:02] <nothingmuch> tr/e/é/

[10:03] <nothingmuch> anyway, back to real work before I get carried away

[10:03] <autrijus> ciao :)

[10:22] <Daniel_Nee> Hi Autrijus, looks like you're still quite busy, I will arrange the demo of FCB permission program to Land Bank on April 14th ( Thursday afternoon), which will give you one more week.

[10:23] <autrijus> Daniel_Nee: sure, that's fine. I'll still go into office tomorrow

[10:26] <autrijus> xern: nice!

[10:26] <nothingmuch> autrijus: where is PA02 at?

[10:26] <nothingmuch> should it be literal haskell?

[10:26] <nothingmuch> or an external doc?

[10:26] <nothingmuch> is it partially done?

[10:26] <nothingmuch> i'd love to help with what I know

[10:26] <autrijus> nothingmuch: PA02 is just a kwid like anything else.

[10:27] <nothingmuch> and this is a good excuse to learn more

[10:27] <autrijus> I've started some outlines. will post it around 6.2.0 time

[10:27] <autrijus> which is this weekend

[10:27] <nothingmuch> jolly

[10:27] <autrijus> but, dinner. bbiab

[10:27] <nothingmuch> could you keep it on SEE somewhere, or maybe check in partial copies, or put them up on the web?

[10:27] <nothingmuch> ok, ciao

[10:28] <autrijus> xern: want a committer bit?

[10:28] * nothingmuch can do that, go eat

[10:28] <autrijus> xern: I'm sure you can start working on tests/examples/primitives, etc :D

[10:28] <autrijus> nothingmuch: ow. ok, gone &

[10:28] <xern> yah, but i guess later after my reviewing other parts :)

[10:28] <autrijus> (but, xern is now a committer. welcome aboard!)

[10:28] <nothingmuch> huraah

[10:28] <xern> how do i commit code?

[10:30] <nothingmuch> that sounds good

[10:30] <nothingmuch> explain progress?

[10:31] <theorbtwo> Well, I no longer die horribly with a segfault or internal error.

[10:36] <ingy> hola

[10:37] <nothingmuch> why is it so popular?

[10:37] <theorbtwo> Hola, ingy.

[10:37] <theorbtwo> Because at the time, it was better then most other things around for a wide class of problems.

[10:38] <theorbtwo> Oh, wait.

[10:38] <castaway> because its a virus, and is everywhere? :)

[10:38] <theorbtwo> Cplusplus, not C.  In that case, I have no idea.

[10:38] <theorbtwo> Sorry.

[10:38] <ingy> hi theorbtwo 

[10:38] * castaway waves at Mr. Kwiki

[10:39] <theorbtwo> ingy, can we get a function in P6::Bible to give us the raw POD of a document by name?

[10:40] <ingy> hmmm

[10:40] <ingy> perldoc -m Perl6::Bible::A01 :P

[10:40] <theorbtwo> Ugh; there already is a Perl6::Bible .pm; it should do something useful.

[10:41] <theorbtwo> Backticking out to perldoc is ugly as all get-out.

[10:41] <ingy> well it was a quick hack, and fairly useful

[10:42] <ingy> so you want `perldoc --raw s01` ?

[10:42] <theorbtwo> I wouldn't mind if it was just encapsulated backticks.

[10:42] <ingy> er

[10:42] <ingy> so you want `p6bible --raw s01` ?

[10:42] * ingy is just waking up

[10:43] <theorbtwo> No, I want perl -MPerl6::Bible -e'print Perl6::Bible::getdoc("S01");'

[10:43] <ingy> oh

[10:44] <ingy> I see.sure

[10:49] <theorbtwo> Shall I wait until after you've woken up the rest of the way for my other problems?

[10:50] <ingy> theorbtwo: ?

[10:50] <castaway> *g*

[10:51] <theorbtwo> YAML isn't charset-smart; if I store a string with chr(0x100) in it, and tell it to read it back, I get back two chars, unless I handle the charset stuff myself.

[10:52] <ingy> anything else?

[10:52] <theorbtwo> That's it, I think.

[10:52] <ingy> phew

[10:52] <theorbtwo> The second is pretty minor; I already do the charset dance myself.  But gaal wanted it to work with 5.6.

[10:55] * castaway wonders if she can order some kwiki-plugin-pod while we're at it :)

[10:55] <nothingmuch> oh oh oh, me too

[10:56] <nothingmuch> i want YAML to be able to serialize whole processes quickly

[10:56] <nothingmuch> so i could do continuations in perl5

[10:56] <nothingmuch> i expect results within two weeks, max

[10:56] <theorbtwo> OTOH, just to note some Karmic balance, I'm working on getting SHA1 working.

[11:14] <theorbtwo> I think I see.

[11:15] <theorbtwo> Hm, perhaps not.

[11:16] <castaway> hmpf, gentoo still insists on 6.2.2, even when ghc-bin is installed

[11:17] <nothingmuch> gentoo is troubling me that way

[11:17] <nothingmuch> i need GHC 6.2 for darcs to live

[11:17] <nothingmuch> and 6.4 for pugs to live

[11:17] * castaway checks the keywords again

[11:17] <castaway> eep :)

[11:17] <nothingmuch> i also want wxpython 2.5

[11:17] <nothingmuch> but it is complete masked out

[11:17] <nothingmuch> and been that way since november

[11:18] <theorbtwo> Uff.

[11:20] <castaway> Hmm, I see no reason why it doesnt install me ghc 6.4 :(

[11:20] <nothingmuch> package.keywords?

[11:21] <castaway> has dev-lang/ghc-bin ~x86

[11:21] <castaway> dev-lang/ghc ~x86

[11:21] <castaway> in it

[11:21] <nothingmuch> your package.keywords? or the one that is rsync'd?

[11:21] <castaway> /etc/portage/package.keywords

[11:21] <castaway> is there another one?

[11:22] <nothingmuch> that's the one i mean

[11:22] <nothingmuch> there's the one with the default maskings and such

[11:22] <castaway> thats the one the docs tell me to add to, and it worked for other stuff

[11:22] <nothingmuch> i so don't know what I'm talking about, i should just shut up

[11:22] <castaway> hmm, default? was empty when I started it

[11:32] <jabbot> pugs - 1596 - atalog_tests.pl upgrade, because t\Synop

[11:33] * nothingmuch has a dirty fix for that

[11:33] <nothingmuch> checks out from svn.perl.org/.../syn

[11:35] <castaway> hmm?

[11:35] <nothingmuch> jabbot: pugs - 1596 - atalog_tests.pl upgrade, because t\Synop

[11:35] <jabbot> nothingmuch: Does that reason seem to explain anything else?

[11:35] <autrijus> mm?

[11:35] <theorbtwo> Did you reindent large swaths of my code?

[11:35] <nothingmuch> i need to make all my Q&D fixes "real"

[11:35] <nothingmuch> perhaps

[11:35] <nothingmuch> i moved some stuff around

[11:36] <nothingmuch> but that was a while ago

[11:36] * theorbtwo nods.

[11:36] <nothingmuch> rootmj seems to have done that

[11:36] <castaway> haskell-tidy?

[11:36] <nothingmuch> perl, actually ;-)

[11:36] <theorbtwo> I asked ingy for the function in p6bible that we need to use it sanely.

[11:37] * theorbtwo needs to make his emacs sane with tabbing.

[11:37] <nothingmuch> does p6bible get latest?

[11:37] <theorbtwo> (IE always use spaces.)

[11:37] <theorbtwo> It's supposed to, I think.

[11:37] <castaway> ah well, perltidy then.. (I still need one that does what i like ,)

[11:37] <theorbtwo> I'm really pining for just having the docs in the pugs repo.

[11:37] <theorbtwo> ...with magic on the server side to keep them up to date.

[11:38] * autrijus mumbles something about svn:external.

[11:38] <theorbtwo> That sounds like the right sort of magic.

[11:39] <theorbtwo> Speak up, indeterminate-aged probably-not-a-grasshopper.

[11:40] * nothingmuch tries to remember where 'grasshopper always wrong in argument with chicken comes from'

[11:40] * theorbtwo wonders how the traditional Chinese translation of The Diamond Age does on the bit about translating KFC.

[11:40] * autrijus doesn't seem to recall a Diamond Age translation

[11:40] * nothingmuch goes to find his principia discordia, on the desk of whomever has it at the moment in the office

[11:40] <autrijus> oh wait, there is on

[11:40] <autrijus> one

[11:42] <theorbtwo> The book makes a reference to translating "Kentucky Fried Chicken" to "The House of the Venerable and Inscrutable Colonel:.

[11:42] <theorbtwo> Er, s/:/"/

[11:43] <nothingmuch> ah yes! page 48

[11:43] * nothingmuch goes to photocopy for reference

[11:44] <theorbtwo> Mmm, nm?

[11:44] * castaway thunk that had a website somewheres

[11:45] * obra has a nice pic of the venerable and inscrutable colonel printed onto corrugated plastic from taipei

[11:45] <theorbtwo> Um, does he look different there?

[11:46] <obra> not really

[11:46] <nothingmuch> theorbtwo: are you familiar with the principia discordia?

[11:46] <obra> though in Tokyo, I saw statues of him dressed as a samurai

[11:46] <theorbtwo> Mildly, nothingmuch.

[11:46] <theorbtwo> OK, now /that/ is certianly photoworthy.

[11:46] <nothingmuch> on page 48 is a wonderful quote about grasshoppers

[11:47] <obra> theorbtwo: I took pictures;)

[11:47] <webmind> nothingmuch, which version ?

[11:47] <nothingmuch> "grasshopper always wrong in argument with chicken" -- Book of Chan, compiled by O.P.U sect

[11:47] <nothingmuch> 4th ed, IIRC

[11:47] <webmind> k

[11:48] <nothingmuch> http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/55.php

[11:48] <theorbtwo> http://www.trip23.com/pd/body/body_48_txt.htm

[11:48] <nothingmuch> txt is teh suxx0r

[11:48] <nothingmuch> (for the principia, that is. Otherwise I love it)

[11:49] <nothingmuch> IIRC metaperl_ implemented this: http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/78.php

[11:58] <castaway> Blubb.

[11:58] <theorbtwo> Blubb?

[11:59] <castaway> Blubb.

[11:59] <theorbtwo> Take an actual-walking-outside lunch break?

[12:00] <castaway> But the outside is 17 floors down!

[12:00] <theorbtwo> There's an elevator.  6, IIRC.

[12:01] <nothingmuch> 17 floors... dear god

[12:01] <theorbtwo> She's only around halfway up, too, nm.

[12:01] <nothingmuch> it's been a long time since I've been that high

[12:01] <castaway> Puh, in the UK office they have whiskey and cake for birthdays??

[12:01] <castaway> quote: "Yes, thanks - I've not tried it yet, I've just been off for birthday whisky+cake. Hurrah!"

[12:01] <castaway> not quite, theres 21floors, 4 above me

[12:02] <nothingmuch> wow, coolness

[12:02] * nothingmuch sometimes drinks beer for lunch

[12:02] <nothingmuch> and there's lots of occasions where wine is served

[12:02] <castaway> nm, its quite a view.. I have a panorama pic somewhere (theres only about 6 or so buildings in munich this high)

[12:02] <theorbtwo> Yeah, that's great for productivity!  Get everybody drunk for lunch, then file them back into the office for an afternoon working.

[12:02] * nothingmuch usually takes care of the leftover wine

[12:03] <nothingmuch> (for cleanliness, that is ;-)

[12:03] <castaway> right.

[12:03] <nothingmuch> (you can't just leave all those half filled cups lying around)

[12:03] <theorbtwo> They'll attract flies!

[12:03] <nothingmuch> exactly!

[12:03] * castaway watches windows copy data from the slowest server ever (I think it has a 1mbit network card or something)

[12:04] <nothingmuch> and, you know, they might be heavy when you try to collect them

[12:04] <nothingmuch> that's scary

[12:04] <castaway> it IS 4gb, but it'll probably take the rest of the afternoon

[12:04] <theorbtwo> Ahh, back in the day, when BNC was "thin ethernet", and 10mbps was "fast ethernet".

[12:04] <nothingmuch> my line broadband is more than that

[12:04] <nothingmuch> (i never thought i'd get the chance to say that)

[12:05] <nothingmuch> theorbtwo: i wasn't born yet =(

[12:05] <nothingmuch> well, no, i'm exaggerating

[12:05] <nothingmuch> but i've yet to use hardware from the 10mbit era

[12:05] <nothingmuch> that I wasn't playing with for historical reasons

[12:05] <theorbtwo> Yes, well, I've never seen BNC actually used for data.

[12:05] <nothingmuch> i did have a mac with 1mbit or so, i think. it could have been 10mb

[12:06] <nothingmuch> but i have never networked it

[12:06] <theorbtwo> I've used plenty of 10mbit equipment, though.

[12:06] <nothingmuch> and it was old by then

[12:06] <theorbtwo> How old are you, nm, and how long ago did you get into computers?

[12:07] * castaway still runs around with a BNC end piece in her pocket, cos some idiot would remove it from the end, and all the data would fall out

[12:07] <nothingmuch> 19

[12:07] * castaway boggles.

[12:07] <nothingmuch> and long ago: i think the first program i actually wrote was a y2k countdown

[12:07] <theorbtwo> Because I was using 10mbit stuff for mission-criticial networking 3 years ago.

[12:07] <nothingmuch> and there were 100 days or so left

[12:07] <theorbtwo> Ah, how quaint.

[12:07] <nothingmuch> that was javascript

[12:07] <nothingmuch> it came after about a year of really using computers

[12:07] <theorbtwo> 2036 (or is that 8?) is when everything is going to die.

[12:08] <nothingmuch> not just playing with them

[12:08] * castaway checks.. yup, still there

[12:08] <nothingmuch> then around a year later i decided to use perl

[12:08] <nothingmuch> and a year after that or so i actually got around to it

[12:09] <nothingmuch> oh wait! the school network was 1mbit BNC when I was in the 7th grade!

[12:09] <nothingmuch> so i lied

[12:09] <nothingmuch> i used BNC a lot for video though

[12:10] <theorbtwo> I remember my school being on appletalk for a while, but that uses RJ-45, not BNC.

[12:10] * castaway feels old

[12:10] <obra> Wouldn't that have been Asante PhoneNET over RJ11?

[12:10] <nothingmuch> this was a network of 90MHz dells or something like that

[12:11] <castaway> network, at school? ,)

[12:11] <obra> (appletalk over rj 45 would only map to ethernet, I think)

[12:11] <nothingmuch> no, sorry, they were digitals

[12:11] <nothingmuch> wow, that was from when digital still was

[12:11] <nothingmuch> now *I* feel old

[12:12] <castaway> bah.

[12:12] <theorbtwo> Er, right, RJ11, not EJ45.

[12:13] <theorbtwo> It's been a while since I did any real networking work.

[12:13] <theorbtwo> Where by real I mean layer 1.

[12:24] * castaway wants time off.

[12:26] <castaway> (One of those, lots of time do nothing, holidays..)

[12:27] <Odin-> Oooooh. Kinda like unemployment?

[12:28] * nothingmuch gets depressed with nothing to do

[12:28] <nothingmuch> must work, or hike

[12:28] * Odin- is depressed anyway, so it's not much of a change.

[12:28] <nothingmuch> anything else is not sufficient to keep me interested

[12:28] <castaway> nm .. "do nothing" means "no obligations".. ie just gimme my computer :)

[12:28] <nothingmuch> heh

[12:28] <castaway> Odin-: yeah, kinda :)

[12:28] <nothingmuch> castaway: what kind of vacation is one where you keep using the computer?

[12:28] <castaway> one without any interruptions?

[12:29] <theorbtwo> One where you have time to do what you want to on the computer, rather then what your employer wants you to do.

[12:29] <nothingmuch> beh

[12:29] <Odin-> nothingmuch: Whaddya mean? You actually can move away from the computer?

[12:29] <castaway> right

[12:29] <nothingmuch> yes

[12:29] <castaway> preferably one that also doesnt involve cooking, cleaning and washing etc.. but thats really dreaming

[12:29] <nothingmuch> i like doing that, too

[12:30] <nothingmuch> otherwise i lose my mind

[12:30] <nothingmuch> if i overdo something i lose interest

[12:30] <nothingmuch> it's one way of controlling ADD

[12:30] <nothingmuch> not that I'm 100% that I have it

[12:30] <nothingmuch> cooking is nice, that is one fo the things I do to get away from the computers

[12:30] <castaway> I would, if I had time ;)

[12:30] <nothingmuch> and cleaning is something I do when I need a 10 minute break

[12:30] <castaway> nm, yeah it is when you have a choice

[12:30] <Odin-> (I might note that usually at least a week of my summer is spent in a place which was abandoned over fifty years ago, and thus lacks even reliable telecommunications.)

[12:30] <nothingmuch> and washing is something i like doing anyway, so =)

[12:30] <castaway> it's not so much when it has to be done no matter whether you can be bothered or not

[12:30] * Odin- has been diagnosed with ADHD.

[12:30] <nothingmuch> Odin-: that's something i'd like to do

[12:31] <nothingmuch> here any area that is not inhabited for several miles is an army firing zone

[12:31] <Odin-> And I fulfil most of the criteria for several other DSM disorders... :/

[12:31] * nothingmuch thinks he should have said several km, but that doesn't sound well in english

[12:31] <castaway> bah, disorders

[12:32] <castaway> there is no normal, dammit

[12:32] <Odin-> castaway: Nah. But I suppose wanting to kill yourself is outside of whatever you might call 'healthy'...

[12:33] <nothingmuch> s/disorders/traits/

[12:33] <nothingmuch> ;-)

[12:33] <webmind> 'differances from the majority'

[12:33] <nothingmuch> webmind: the majority is different

[12:33] <nothingmuch> =)

[12:33] <Odin-> Frankly, I think people are WAY too stuck up about being politically correct.

[12:33] <castaway> right.

[12:33] <webmind> nothingmuch, yes.. but shares commons

[12:34] <theorbtwo> I think people are far to concerned about being healthy, and not concerned enough at being happy.

[12:34] <Odin-> ADHD is real. It's overdiagnosed, and is often used as an excuse to subdue kids ... but it's still real.

[12:34] <nothingmuch> theorbtwo: oh man, sooo ditto

[12:34] <webmind> like the most people have 2 arms and 2 legs

[12:34] <nothingmuch> and a nose!

[12:34] <castaway> right but some dont, so what?

[12:34] * nothingmuch has several problems: concentrating, reading, etc. I solve them by doing things I like

[12:34] <nothingmuch> taking breaks

[12:35] <nothingmuch> walking around

[12:35] <webmind> that means they differentiate from the majority

[12:35] <nothingmuch> no ritalin for me

[12:35] <Odin-> Heh.

[12:35] <nothingmuch> no funny methods

[12:35] <theorbtwo> And thumbs.  But the ones that don't mostly aren't obsessed with wishing they had more of them.

[12:35] <nothingmuch> i get to 80% of what I feel I want

[12:35] <castaway> webmind: The german disability system thinks I'm 100% disabled.. 

[12:35] <webmind> Odin-, I prefer not to be labeled as having a malfunction or whatever

[12:35] <webmind> castaway, why ?

[12:35] <nothingmuch> but it's good enough for me

[12:36] <webmind> what does ritalin do ?

[12:36] <nothingmuch> castaway: how often do you get people with that 'take off your thumb' magic trick?

[12:36] <Odin-> nothingmuch: The school prohibits me from even trying that.

[12:36] <castaway> webmind: because it compares physical differences to the "norm" whatever that is

[12:36] <nothingmuch> webmind: it is supposed to make you concentrate better

[12:36] <castaway> and my missing bits add up

[12:36] <shapr> Hail Eris!

[12:36] <xerox> It has many effects

[12:36] <theorbtwo> Thumbs, a kidney, some vertebre, one bone in the left arm, some other stuff.

[12:36] <webmind> nothingmuch, ah ok

[12:36] <nothingmuch> fed like candy to "hyperactive" children

[12:36] <castaway> can't do it, nm

[12:36] <Odin-> webmind: Fine. Then fight against ADHD being considered a 'malfunction'.

[12:36] <nothingmuch> shapr: Hail, hail, fellow POEE

[12:36] <theorbtwo> POEE?

[12:37] <shapr> Paratheonametamystikhood of Eris Esoteric, of course.

[12:37] <webmind> Odin-, I wouldn't know.. don't know much about adhd

[12:37] <nothingmuch> castaway: i mean, "see? my thumb's disappeared!"

[12:37] <theorbtwo> Oh, yeah, Pope of the Eristian someither...

[12:37] <Odin-> webmind: Well, I do. I have it.

[12:37] <webmind> Odin-, and would you call it a malfunction ?

[12:37] <shapr> I've heard of ADHD, isn't that where you get drugs to sit still?

[12:37] <webmind> Odin-, would you call it a disability ?

[12:37] *** nothingmuch changes topic to: -><-

[12:37] <Odin-> webmind: I would call it a disability, yes.

[12:37] <nothingmuch> =D

[12:38] <webmind> Odin-, good enough.. then it is

[12:38] *** nothingmuch changes topic to: pugscode.org <<Overview Journal Logs>> | You have safely opened the door to many Perl 6 hackers. | pugs.kwiki.org | smoke: http://xrl.us/fmw2 | Mac OS X r1567 (267/3922) | Win2k r1576 (281/4129)+1Unex

[12:38] <Odin-> webmind: But that's not inherent in ADHD, but is a problem of the &$&#%#! school system. ;)

[12:38] <shapr> I wouldn't call ADHD a disability. I'd call a societal malfunction.

[12:38] <shapr> There aren't anymore frontiers :-(

[12:38] <webmind> Odin-, ah

[12:39] <xkb_> ah hi shapr

[12:39] <xkb_> nice piece on ltu :D

[12:39] <shapr> ah, thanks!

[12:39] * webmind could often call things a cultural problem.. and not a problem to the issue in question.. not sure if that's the case with ADHD ?

[12:39] <xkb_> you got me interessted in any case :D

[12:39] <shapr> yay!

[12:39] <castaway> Maybe its just me, but I seem to hear so many people announcing they have some disorder beginning with AD*, that it seems to be more normal than different

[12:40] <nothingmuch> castaway: many many people have them,

[12:40] <shapr> I think ADHD is normal for humans, but abnormal for the highly ritualized society of the present.

[12:40] <castaway> well its not a malfunction then

[12:40] <Odin-> shapr: Then you don't know what ADHD is. ;)

[12:40] <nothingmuch> but IIRC in school i don't remember many people having such trouble

[12:40] <nothingmuch> there was the one guy who really couldn't function

[12:41] <nothingmuch> and there was me, who could only pay attention in 3 minute chunks

[12:41] <shapr> Odin-: I think I have a clue about ADHD

[12:41] <castaway> (also seems to be a recent thing.. )

[12:41] <nothingmuch> and i don't remember anyone else having such trouble 

[12:41] <Odin-> shapr: Do you have it? :>

[12:41] <nothingmuch> and BTW, for the record, I think that I don't have it

[12:41] <shapr> Odin-: yes

[12:41] <nothingmuch> because it's not so severe

[12:42] <shapr> Some references are http://www.borntoexplore.org/ and http://www.reciprocality.org/Reciprocality/index.html

[12:43] <shapr> I've written about ADHD and Ritalin on Ward's Wiki - http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AttentionDeficitDisorder and http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RitalinDrug

[12:43] <Odin-> shapr: Interesting. How, exactly, is it "normal for humans"?

[12:43] <castaway> ha, direct quote there

[12:43] <castaway> In our experience it is evidence that most of what is being called ADD today would not have been called ADD fifteen or twenty years ago and that much of it falls within the range of normal boy behavior

[12:44] <castaway> (stupid diagnostics giving names to such things)

[12:45] <Odin-> That's rubbish.

[12:45] <shapr> Odin-: ADHD is a different balance in the brain, and it's useful to society in a variety of roles. It's really bad for bean counting though.

[12:45] <Odin-> Or, alternatively, that's evidence of overdiagnosis.

[12:46] <Odin-> shapr: You mean that it's not pathological?

[12:46] <Limbic_Region> Odin- if you haven't already, you should pick up a copy of "Driven To Distraction"

[12:47] <shapr> No, it's not pathological. ADHD has a genetic basis. Some people claim that it requires both nature and nurture, but I'm not sure if I believe them.

[12:47] <Odin-> shapr: Okay, I'll agree with that. :)

[12:48] <shapr> Yeah, I have "Driven to Distraction", "Out of the Fog" and "You Mean I'm not Lazy, Crazy, or Stupid?"

[12:48] <Odin-> It's a "problem" only in today's *seriously* fucked up society...

[12:48] <Limbic_Region> AFAIK, there is still a distinction between ADD and ADHD though outside of the medical/psychological community the line is very blurred

[12:49] <shapr> Odin-: I'd say that this society is pathological from the viewpoint of an ADD person. The stuff on reciprocality.org is really weird, but also kind of makes sense.

[12:49] <autrijus> it's not a problem at all. :)

[12:49] <autrijus> to me, at least.

[12:49] <Limbic_Region> people who are able to function with ADD usually see it that way - I believe for others it is disabilatating

[12:49] <Odin-> It is, for me.

[12:50] <Odin-> I constantly hit against the walls of 'normalcy'.

[12:50] <Limbic_Region> in fact, some people are more succesful as a result of their ADD

[12:50] <autrijus> however it was a serious problem to me before I discovered ways toward hackable brains

[12:50] <Odin-> I get into trouble at school, because I'm not 'paying attention'.

[12:50] <shapr> autrijus: yeah, metacognition and self-modification

[12:50] <Odin-> (I once played QIII through classes. I noticed the lectures better than without it.)

[12:50] <autrijus> Odin-: nod. I dropped out when I was 14yrs old

[12:51] * Odin- doesn't have that alternative. :(

[12:51] * Limbic_Region barely graduated highschool

[12:51] <shapr> I use 'Personal Unit Tests' because my internal feedback loops don't work much - http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PersonalLoopbackTests

[12:51] <Odin-> I mean, unemployment has been skyrocketing for the last few years. There's literally no alternative. :/

[12:51] <Limbic_Region> in fact - I wouldn't have had I not moved in the middle of my senior year with all failing grades - the idea of being able to pull of passing was enough to actually make me do it - of course I also had a full time job and was taking a class at the university as well

[12:53] <shapr> I think you can use the differences as strengths, but you can't do it if you try to fit into the rest of society.

[12:53] <castaway> shapr++

[12:53] <autrijus> there is no rest of society in general and one cannot fit at all :D

[12:54] * shapr likes that viewpoint

[12:54] <castaway> indeed

[12:54] <castaway> make your own way, don't conform. (Although parts are hard not to)

[12:54] <Odin-> Meh. There certainly is a 'rest of society'. It just usually doesn't want to be drawn up that way.

[12:54] <webmind> shapr, same with autism me thinks

[12:54] <Odin-> Geekship just doesn't have many elements of that 'rest'. ;)

[12:55] <Limbic_Region> shapr - I am not sure I agree with you - I don't believe that all people are capable of using their ADD as a strength

[12:55] <Limbic_Region> I believe in some it is a matter of choice or education

[12:55] <castaway> Limbic_Region: yeah, those that get stuck wanting to do what they cant (same problem with some physically disabled people)

[12:55] <Limbic_Region> but in others, they just can't adapt 

[12:56] <shapr> I can't filter my visual inputs, moving objects in my peripheral vision or cute blonde females always get my visual focus. I've exploited this as a strength by using an acid color theme and now information about the code just jumps into my head automatically http://www.scannedinavian.org/~shae/secret-joy.png

[12:56] <autrijus> oh. wow. fellow ion user?

[12:56] <webmind> shapr, horrible ;)

[12:56] <shapr> webmind: but hard to ignore :-)

[12:57] <webmind> shapr, so true

[12:57] <shapr> autrijus: yes, I like ion

[12:57] <pjcj> I use ion too ;-)

[12:57] <shapr> Limbic_Region: I've thought of an ADD Reader javascript that shows only one line of very large text moving across the screen, I think that would also exploit distractability for learning.

[12:58] <autrijus> metacity here, but if I get some more time maybe I'll retry conf ion

[12:58] <autrijus> the good (and bad) thing about IRC is that it moves constantly ;)

[12:59] * shapr agrees

[12:59] <Limbic_Region> shapr - I am not trying to be argumentative and I agree, there is a lot more that could be done to help a larger percentage with education and exploring alternative learning methods

[12:59] <castaway> ,)

[12:59] <xerox> Why is it good and bad?

[12:59] <Limbic_Region> but I have come to realize that some people just "can't get it" no matter how you try to help them

[12:59] <obra> metacity is great. "whole screen mode" with one key is a lofesaver

[12:59] <castaway> because it distracts

[12:59] <Limbic_Region> and they can't help themselves

[12:59] * castaway nods at Limbic sadly

[12:59] <xerox> obra, which key? :-)

[12:59] <Odin-> Limbic_Region: Others want to do something else, but are forced not to.

[13:00] <Odin-> Left handed people forced to write with their right, anyone?

[13:00] * shapr raises his left hand

[13:00] <Limbic_Region> Odin- and that extends to shapr's point about it being a societal hurdle.  I agree that it is one, but it isn't the only thing stopping people from living succesful and rewarding lives

[13:00] <xerox> Really? :-(

[13:00] <shapr> I was forced to write right-handed for a coupla years in the beginning.

[13:00] <obra> xerox: for me, alt-space. buit configurable

[13:01] <Odin-> Limbic_Region: No, but it is one. For some, maybe the only one. For others, the first one. Perhaps the second, third, or later for others.

[13:01] <Limbic_Region> being a relatively intelligent individual, I failed to understand how some people just couldn't get things I was explaining to them no matter how I explained it

[13:01] <Limbic_Region> it took me a long time to realize the differences between intelligence, knowledge, and wisdom

[13:01] <Odin-> shapr: That ... sucks.

[13:02] * Odin- has a bit of the first, a byte of the second, and pretty much none of the last... :p

[13:02] <xerox> Limbic_Region, it happened to someone who I was trying to explain a thing, but I still think that he *can* understand it if I try in another way.  What do you have realized, exactly?

[13:03] <Limbic_Region> xerox - that the capacity for adaptability or alternative thinking just isn't present in some people or that they refuse to let themselves see things that way no matter how hard they think they want to

[13:04] <xkb_> bubye

[13:04] <xkb_> quit

[13:04] <xkb_> aargh

[13:04] <autrijus> greetings Juerd-san!

[13:04] <Limbic_Region> take a concept like the big bang - you try to explain the universe existing at some point as being no larger than your fist with no outside vantage point - people think 3 dimensionally - if it is the size of my fist, there MUST be an outside

[13:04] <Limbic_Region> no matter how you explain it to them - they will just never get it

[13:05] <shapr> autrijus: hey, did you see my Pugs post on LtU?

[13:06] <autrijus> shapr: yes. lovely

[13:06] <shapr> :-)

[13:07] <Limbic_Region> in any case, I am trying to say that both ends of the pendulum swing are wrong - it is neither just a disability nor is it just a social malfunction - it is a personally relative thing that falls somewhere in between the two endpoints

[13:08] <Limbic_Region> on that note - I am off for a bit

[13:10] <shapr> Yeah, time to suck down some ritalin and count some beans.

[13:11] <shapr> Sometimes I'm unhappy that ritalin is necessary for me to keep a job - http://www.scannedinavian.com/2005-03-03.html

[13:11] <shapr> Anyway, what's the priority for Pugs at the moment?

[13:12] <autrijus> for this week, for me personally, is fixing the storage model

[13:12] <autrijus> so multidim structures work

[13:12] <autrijus> and %*ENV can be "tied"

[13:12] <autrijus> then it's fixing various parsefails.

[13:12] <autrijus> goal is to release 6.2.0 on weekends.

[13:12] <autrijus> then the priority is PA02. following that, IMC stuff.

[13:14] <autrijus> other people have other people's priorities. this is anarchy after all :D

[13:15] <shapr> Google doesn't tell me much about PA02 and IMC. I've seen the IMC directory in the pugs sources, but what's PA02?

[13:16] <autrijus> PA01 is Pugs Apocryphon 2, Technical Overview

[13:16] <autrijus> aka Design of Pugs

[13:16] <shapr> ohh

[13:16] <autrijus> aka How to start hacking

[13:16] * xerox looks forward to it.

[13:16] <autrijus> I guess I'll just name it "design"

[13:17] <autrijus> I'll post a outline on weekends

[13:17] <autrijus> and solicit another question fest

[13:28] <ashok> is perl  6.0 out ???

[13:28] <xerox> ashok, more or less ;)

[13:29] <autrijus> ashok: no, not yet. but you can have a Free Preview

[13:29] <ashok> autrijus : where do i find preview

[13:30] <autrijus> ashok: http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl6-Pugs/

[13:31] <autrijus> shapr: also, IMC is this amazing typed high level assembly thing

[13:31] <autrijus> http://www.parrotcode.org/faq/imcc.html

[13:32] <shapr> interesting!

[13:34] <autrijus> the plan is to write a minimal compiler that compiles IMCC to TH.

[13:34] <autrijus> using GADTs to model the typed registers.

[13:34] <autrijus> maybe you'd be interested :)

[13:34] <autrijus> IMC is also very fast when running on parrot.

[13:35] <shapr> that does sound very interesting

[13:35] <ashok> thanks autrijus 

[13:35] <autrijus> np =)

[13:35] * castaway ponders an irssi addon that looks up acronyms when clicked on.. (or something)

[13:35] <autrijus> TH is template haskell, http://haskell.org/th/

[13:36] <castaway> GADT ?

[13:37] <shapr> Generalised Algebraic Data Type, but I like cognominal's suggestion better.

[13:37] <autrijus> http://research.microsoft.com/%7Esimonpj/papers/gadt/index.htm

[13:38] <castaway> wobbly types?

[13:38] <autrijus> also see http://autrijus.org/tmp/old.hs versus http://autrijus.org/tmp/gadt.hs

[13:38] <shapr> jello :: Wobbly

[13:41] * castaway wonders if thats mappable to something she knows without knowing any haskell (or very little)

[13:41] <rgs> the second aprocryphon isn't commited yet, I assume

[13:42] <theorbtwo> foo :: bar generally means something named foo of type bar.

[13:43] <autrijus> rgs: no. why?

[13:43] <castaway> "that" === GADT

[13:43] <rgs> just being curious

[13:44] <autrijus> :)

[13:45] <autrijus> castaway: sadly, probably not.

[13:46] <castaway> mmpf :)

[13:46] <autrijus> it is conceivable that Perl 6's subtyping mechanism will be strong enough to contain GADTs.

[13:46] <autrijus> but it's very much not there yet :)

[13:47] <castaway> I dont know that one either though :)

[13:49] <mugwump> Ah, great, I meant to ask you for a copy of those two haskell files yesterday, autrijus 

[13:49] *** stevan changes topic to: pugscode.org <<Overview Journal Logs>> | You have safely opened the door to many Perl 6 hackers. | pugs.kwiki.org | smoke: http://xrl.us/fmw2 | Mac OS X r1596 (273/4123) | Win2k r1576 (281/4129)+1Unex

[13:49] <stevan> morning all (or evening, or afternoon, etc etc etc)

[13:51] <autrijus> castaway: ok. for example, in perl 5, the source is parsed into a B::* data structure

[13:52] <autrijus> then upon evaluation/compilation, another pass called "context propagation" is done

[13:52] <autrijus> to figure out each expression's context (scalar, list, void)

[13:52] * castaway nods.

[13:52] <autrijus> that pass is often error prone when writing optimizers

[13:52] <autrijus> because you can easily generate "nonsense" ops

[13:53] <autrijus> i.e. there is nothing in the B::* tree that guarantees correctness

[13:53] <autrijus> of the context, or of the parameters.

[13:53] <autrijus> so if the parser / optimizer / propagator got it wrong

[13:53] <autrijus> you get nasty subtle bugs or outright segfaults.

[13:54] <Limbic_Region> GADTs will eliminate the nasty subtle bugs

[13:54] <autrijus> yes. because it makes nonsense OPs impossible.

[13:54] <Limbic_Region> only possible ops will get generated

[13:54] <autrijus> you just can't write a AST that will not reduce.

[13:54] * castaway scratches head

[13:54] * Limbic_Region was trying hard to finish autrijus's sentence

[13:55] <autrijus> AST is that B::* tree thing.

[13:55] <castaway> I'm getting the feeling I dont really want to know ,)

[13:55] <autrijus> for example, there's nothing in B::* that prevents you from writing +(+,-)

[13:55] <autrijus> although that is patent nonsense.

[13:55] <Limbic_Region> castaway - let me try and take a stab at it

[13:55] <Limbic_Region> autrijus - correct me if I am wrong

[13:56] <Limbic_Region> when you are writing the second/third/nth pass for another language, it is possible to get it wrong and write valid but nonsensical ops

[13:56] *** gugod_ is now known as gugod

[13:57] <Limbic_Region> GADTs will prevent that from happening, making targeting other backends less prone to error

[13:57] <Limbic_Region> in a nutshell

[13:57] <autrijus> yup.

[13:57] <autrijus> Limbic_Region++

[13:57] <autrijus> without GADTs, it is very easy to generate IMC/Parrot code that makes parrot segfault.

[13:57] <Limbic_Region> Limbic_Region-- # but thanks

[13:58] <autrijus> with GADT, if the resulting code makes parrot segfault, that is squarely Not Our Problem :D

[13:58] <castaway> Hmm, Ok

[14:00] <theorbtwo> GADTs let you write types on constructors in much more detail then was possible before them.

[14:01] <castaway> in Haskell, right?

[14:01] <castaway> (that made much more sense=

[14:01] <autrijus> in any language that has them. but yes, as far as pugs is concerned, that means haskell :)

[14:02] <theorbtwo> When people start throwing around terms like "Algebraic" in strange ways, Haskell is a pretty good bet.

[14:03] <stevan> autrijus: very cool making hangman read the AUTHORS file :)

[14:03] <autrijus> stevan: I'm addicted to it :D

[14:03] <autrijus> <- spent some 20 minutes

[14:03] <stevan> autrijus: should I use File::Spec to construct that path? or would you rather not add the dependecy?

[14:03] <shapr> theorbtwo: that's a good quote

[14:03] <stevan> autrijus: it is kinda fun :)

[14:03] <theorbtwo> Thanks, shapr.

[14:03] <autrijus> stevan: hm? the "/" is portable

[14:04] <stevan> autrijus: ok, then nevermind :

[14:04] <autrijus> if you'd like, sure, but don't worry too muc

[14:04] <stevan> )

[14:04] <autrijus> much

[14:04] <stevan> autrijus: since many people dont make install it is probably best to leave it out

[14:05] <autrijus> you can write lib.pm.

[14:05] <autrijus> and FindBin.pm

[14:05] <autrijus> I wouldn't mind :D

[14:05] <stevan> :)

[14:06] <theorbtwo> I'd prefer that pugs provide the info that FindBin tries to find... because FindBin tends to get it wrong.

[14:06] <stevan> is @INC mutable?

[14:06] <autrijus> sure is

[14:06] <stevan> whoooo hoo

[14:06] <stevan> lib.pm here I come

[14:07] <autrijus> stevan++

[14:07] <stevan> autrijus++ 

[14:07] <shapr> perlbot: karma of windows

[14:07] <perlbot> Karma for windows: -2

[14:07] <jabbot> shapr: of windows has neutral karma

[14:08] <stevan> LOL, dueling chat-bots

[14:08] <gugod> jabbot: that's really stupid.

[14:08] <jabbot> gugod: That is interesting. Please continue.

[14:08] <theorbtwo> karma windows

[14:08] <jabbot> theorbtwo: windows has karma of -1

[14:09] <theorbtwo> Ha:  They also disagree on what the karama of windows is.

[14:10] <stevan> autrijus: no BEGIN {} yet correct?

[14:10] <stevan> autrijus: and does require work at compile time (or close to it)? in the first-come-first-served order?

[14:11] <autrijus> require is just perl5 require.

[14:11] <autrijus> so, first come first served.

[14:11] <autrijus> you can write lib.pm so that

[14:11] <stevan> ok

[14:11] <autrijus> require lib;

[14:12] <autrijus> import('lib': @paths)

[14:12] <autrijus> works

[14:12] <autrijus> that will motivate me to implement 'use' :)

[14:12] <autrijus> although, check the bible to see if import sytnax change

[14:12] <autrijus> changed

[14:18] <stevan> it does look as if there has been some change (http://search.cpan.org/~ingy/Perl6-Bible-0.12/lib/Perl6/Bible/S11.pod#Importation)

[14:19] <stevan> but I dont think it is really relevant to lib.pm

[14:19] <stevan> (at least not at this point)

[14:32] <jabbot> pugs - 1597 - * Added tests for $pair.pairs, $pair.kv,

[14:36] <asavige> Stevan and Autrijus: my neck is getting really sore from being hung. I love your hangman game!

[14:42] <stevan> asavige: thanks :) 

[14:42] <stevan> watch for a CGI version soon

[14:42] * theorbtwo wins two in a row.

[14:43] <stevan> theorbtwo: you are the keeper of the AUTHORS file, I would expect nothing less :)

[14:43] <theorbtwo> I don't do that much keeping...

[14:43] * asavige ponders doing a version that reads the VICTUALS file, might get hung less often then. :-)

[14:43] <theorbtwo> And I have a horrible memory for names.

[14:44] <stevan> asavige: then we would have make it harder and include favorite foods too

[14:44] <theorbtwo> Hm, you can't backspace.

[14:44] <stevan> theorbtwo: Term::Readline is all you :)

[14:45] <theorbtwo> Hm, did merlyn actually do something useful

[14:45] <theorbtwo> ?

[14:46] <stevan> since when did usefulness become a qualification?

[14:46] <theorbtwo> Eh, I thought the qual was useful suggestions, or code in the repo...

[14:47] * theorbtwo looses his first one: Yuval Kogman.

[14:47] <stevan> theorbtwo: I think he helped with a Makefile issue or something

[14:47] <stevan> stevan% pugs -e 'sub foo ($inv: $test) { }; foo("hmm": 1)'

[14:47] <stevan> Wrong number of invocant parameters: 1 actual, 0 expected

[14:47] <stevan> pugs -e 'sub foo ($inv: $test) { }; foo("hmm", 1)'

[14:47] <stevan> Wrong number of invocant parameters: 0 actual, 1 expected

[14:47] <stevan> thats odd

[14:48] <stevan> autrijus: is this a bug in pugs or a bug in me?

[14:49] <theorbtwo> Try foo("hmm": 1);

[14:50] <stevan> theorbtwo: thats the first one

[14:50] * theorbtwo tries to decide if listing the guesses in alpha order vs order made is an improvement.

[14:50] <theorbtwo> Oh, right.

[14:50] <stevan> it tells me no invocants expected

[14:50] <stevan> then when I dont give it an invocant, it tells me it expects one :)

[14:51] * shapr chirrups cheerfully

[14:52] <theorbtwo> Allo, cheerful shapr.

[14:52] <autrijus> yo.

[14:52] <Corion> Does 6.2 by the weekend mean that we get objects by the weekend?

[14:52] <Corion> Or should I look at the roadmap again?

[14:52] <autrijus> check roadmap again :)

[14:53] <Corion> autrijus: Too bad :)

[14:53] <shapr> It's good to be awake. Sleep seems like such a waste of time.

[14:53] <autrijus> it means that by the weekend we can start to refactor mercilessly.

[14:53] <autrijus> toward objects

[14:53] <Corion> autrijus: BTW, you said that I was working on (a) HTTP::Proxy - actually I'm not, but I should start if you promise that :)

[14:53] <autrijus> Corion: :D

[14:53] <Corion> autrijus: Cool! HTTP::Proxy would like objects, as would the other other HTTP stuff.

[14:53] <shapr> Is there really a roadmap online?

[14:53] <autrijus> shapr: sure. PA01

[14:54] <autrijus> shapr: it's part of your magazine

[14:54] <Corion> ... having want() would be cool too, but want() needs objects first, right?

[14:54] <shapr> doh

[14:54] <autrijus> Corion: properly saying, yeah

[14:54] <autrijus> yay! I fixed the stupid parsing bug

[14:54] <autrijus> lc $x, $y  # should parse as lc($x), $y

[14:54] <chip> so now the stupid parsing works?

[14:54] <autrijus> lc, $y # lc($_), $y

[14:55] <autrijus> totally makes no sense

[14:55] <shapr> Great, pugs can parse slashdot now!

[14:55] <stevan> next step idiot parsing

[14:55] <stevan> then dullard parsing

[14:55] <chip> whitehouse.gov

[14:55] <stevan> chip: that may be a little ambitious, thats a lot of stupidity to parse

[14:56] <stevan> autrijus: did you see the invocant weirdness I pasted?

[14:56] <theorbtwo> You'd have to parse lying, cheating, and fucking over the entire world for that.

[14:56] <autrijus> stevan: yes, a sec

[14:56] <stevan> theorbtwo++

[14:56] <Corion> BTW, would porting C<lib.pm> make sense? Or are module imports not yet finalized? Personally, I think that C<use lib;> should translate to "find directory of the script, and use "lib/" there.

[14:56] <Corion> theorbtwo: That comes in 7.0, right?

[14:56] <chip> theorbtwo: Hm.  OK, let's fall back to Microsoft.  No, wait...

[14:57] <stevan> Corion: it is (like most of the current modules) a hack to get things working for now

[14:57] <Corion> Oh. The Win32 segfault during make test is still there

[14:57] <autrijus> Corion: uh, it's actually push @*INC

[14:57] <chip> Corion: cute

[14:57] <Corion> autrijus: I know. But "use lib < ... >;" is much nicer

[14:57] <Limbic_Region> autrijus - out of curiosity, do you still catch up with the log what you missed while sleeping?

[14:57] <chip> autrijus: isn't it unshift?

[14:57] <Corion> ... it's unshift IMO as well

[14:58] <stevan> Limbic_Region: he uses a text-to-speech program to read it to him while he sleeps :)

[14:58] <autrijus> ok, ok, unshift.

[14:58] <rgs> wow, lexical $_

[14:58] <Corion> Anyway - as long as we only have require and not use, that's not really useful ;-) Or are the import semantics the same as with P5 ? That is, use mod <- do Eval "require mod; mod::import()"

[14:59] <Limbic_Region> stevan - didn't edgar cacey claim that's how he discovered he had powers, fell asleep with his head on a book and woke up knowing everything in it?

[14:59] <cognominal> I am searching a site that compared the syntax of ocaml and haskell. This is not merd.net. Does someone have that in his bookmarks?

[14:59] <Corion> ... I could implement the C<use> keyword as some kind of source filter :)

[14:59] <Limbic_Region> autrijus - http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=445097 is another example of the power of Pugs

[14:59] <stevan> Limbic_Region: that was how I studied in high school (which explains all the Ds on my report card)

[15:00] <rgs> cognominal: merd.net is pixel, right ?

[15:00] <autrijus> Limbic_Region: I've seen it :) thx

[15:00] <Limbic_Region> k

[15:00] <rgs> autrijus: have you seen t/op/mydef.t in 5.9.2 for tests for lexcial $_ ?

[15:00] <cognominal> rgs: yes with "une mouche a merde" (dung fly?) as icon.

[15:00] * theorbtwo wonders -- do you properly ASCIIfy ø with oe in Dutch?

[15:00] <Limbic_Region> autrijus - more recently http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=445312 # requesting examples of p6 code

[15:00] <stevan> Corion: proper C<use> means we have BEGIN{}

[15:01] * theorbtwo wouldn't mind improper use.

[15:01] <autrijus> rgs: no... 5.9.2 has lexical $_, right?

[15:01] <Corion> stevan: We have END{}, we don't have BEGIN{} yet?

[15:01] <rgs> autrijus: yes

[15:01] <Corion> Ah, maybe we should have a new keyword, C<abuse> :)

[15:01] <stevan> Corion: nope, is ends but never begins

[15:01] * stevan has to get on a conf call, bbiab &

[15:02] <Corion> stevan: Ah, Ragnarök will begin in time with the Apocalypse

[15:02] <jabbot> pugs - 1600 - * optional unary parsed correctly.

[15:02] <jabbot> pugs - 1599 - * add lexical $_ at startup

[15:02] <jabbot> pugs - 1598 - * Made uc.t, ucfirst.t, lc.t, and lcfirs

[15:02] <Corion> Perl666

[15:02] <Corion> ... which also gives new meaning to Kerberos - it must be a triple-headed descendant of Pugs.

[15:03] <autrijus> :D

[15:03] * shapr laughs

[15:08] <Corion> Oooo. With force_todo, Test.pm has taken its first fateful step in the direction of a general bug tracking system ;-)

[15:12] <obra> oh?

[15:13] <theorbtwo> ______ ______-______ has a very easy-to-guess name. 

[15:13] <Corion> theorbtwo: Did you hook up hangman.p6 to your irc client ? :-)

[15:13] <Corion> E

[15:14] <Corion> ... if Pugs had objects, I'd have written an irc client already :-)))

[15:14] <Corion> ... or at least a simple bot.

[15:14] <Odin-> It would seem that if Pugs had objects, CPAN would already have been rewritten. ;)

[15:14] <Corion> But slinging around records is not as much fun. Hmmm. I don't really need objects - I could fake it all with multisubs. :)

[15:15] <theorbtwo> This is fun!

[15:16] <mugwump> well, if you think you might have an idea, take a look in docs/class and src/Class.hs

[15:16] <Corion> mugwump: No - I mostly stand outside, looking inside through the windows, and stare at the marvels there. :)

[15:17] <mugwump> wimp

[15:17] <mugwump> :)

[15:17] <Corion> And (multi)method dispatch is something I prefer others to touch with a long pole.

[15:17] <Corion> ... actually I pity the poor poles.

[15:17] <autrijus> lol.

[15:19] <obra> pugs++ #more tests than commits

[15:21] <pjcj> that just means it's not working yet ;-)

[15:22] <shapr> Corion: what do you think about mulimethods vs typeclass and/or pattern matching?

[15:22] <jabbot> pugs - 1601 - Fix pernod's AUTHORS line

[15:22] <Corion> Hmmm. To look at Class.hs, I first need to update my editor to something that knows UTF8

[15:22] <Corion> shapr: I like pattern matching. But I'd like to toy around with multimethod dispatch too.

[15:23] <Corion> ... but I haven't done any mmd, while I've toyed around with pattern matching on subroutines for a few days now. :)

[15:23] <autrijus> mmd is just a fancy name for pattern matching :)

[15:23] <cognominal> I have not seen pattern matching in Perl6.

[15:23] <cognominal> WIll rules match types as well as values?

[15:23] <shapr> salut cognominal 

[15:23] <autrijus> however perl 6 mmd also combines (pattern) guards

[15:24] <Corion> autrijus: Hmmm - partly, but once inheritance comes into play, pattern matching becomes ugly :)

[15:24] <cognominal> salut shapr :)

[15:24] <shapr> ca va?

[15:24] <autrijus> Corion: yeah. there's a good reason why haskell has no subtyping

[15:24] <cognominal> sharpr, viens sur #perlfr :)

[15:24] <shapr> ok

[15:25] <rgs> shapr: ttention, c'est pas le mme rseau

[15:26] <cognominal> yes  #perlfr on freenode is lamer only :)

[15:26] <shapr> hm, I can't read latin-1 when my encoding is set to utf-8

[15:27] <cognominal> shapr, come to #Perlfr in irc.perl.fr

[15:27] <shapr> Is Perl popular in .fr?

[15:27] <shapr> ohh

[15:28] <shapr> I suspect my french is not good enough :-) seulement assez pour boire biere

[15:28] <cognominal> that's enough. we can speak english. or so we think.

[15:28] <rgs> we can boire bire too.

[15:30] <shapr> I have considered moving to France for the 'next country'. What parts of France have the most computer scientists and programmer jobs?

[15:31] <cognominal> Paris, Grenoble, Toulouse, Rennes...

[15:31] <rgs> Lyon...

[15:31] <rgs> mostly Paris

[15:31] <shapr> Hm, Toulouse also has the most unicyclists.

[15:32] <jabbot> pugs - 1602 - * fix invs length count misdetection dur

[15:32] <autrijus> stevan: your bug fixed. thanks

[15:35] <autrijus> another 43 revs today.

[15:35] <autrijus> it does seem that pugs is keeping a steady pace.

[15:35] <autrijus> linear sustainable growth etc :)

[15:35] * shapr cheers

[15:35] <Corion> Heh. There's a weird parsefail: my $res = (1 & 2 ^ 3); works. ok( (1 & 2 ^ 3) < 3, "and also ^"); parsefails.

[15:36] <Corion> (I'm eliminating some string evals for warming up)

[15:36] <Corion> ... I should maybe eliminate these weird parsefails into their own tests...

[15:36] <autrijus> hrm? it's not a parsefail here

[15:36] <shapr> autrijus: What do you think about QuickCheck tests? Is there a place for them in pugs? Would it be better to stick with the culturally familiar t/foo/bar.t ?

[15:36] <autrijus> shapr: I've been meaning to add QuickCheck for a long time now

[15:37] <autrijus> shapr: if you want, certainly go ahead and take a stab at it

[15:37] <autrijus> so I can learn

[15:37] <autrijus> <- did not take the time to learn quickcheck properly

[15:37] <Corion> autrijus: Weird. Indeed. If I do pugs -e ...,  it's no parsefail, but inside the (test) script, it is. I need to investigate further...

[15:37] <shapr> QuickCheck is straightforward, I'll put some tests in soon.

[15:37] <autrijus> woot!

[15:37] <autrijus> shapr++

[15:37] <autrijus> shapr++

[15:37] <Corion> QuickCheck?

[15:37] <autrijus> Corion: http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-LectroTest/

[15:38] <autrijus> (but much easier in haskell)

[15:38] <shapr> Corion: I wrote a short explanation about QuickCheck on the extremeperl mailing list.

[15:39] <Corion> Gah. All alone the test works. :(

[15:40] <cognominal> shapr: if you are interested we have perl related mailing list in French. You can propagathe perl6 and haskell faith there

[15:40] <shapr> haha

[15:41] <cognominal> heresy is almost a dogma for the mongueurs (French name for mongers)

[15:41] <shapr> I don't think haskell or perl6 are a religious issue. They are precious gems of knowledge hiding just under the surface.

[15:42] <jabbot> pugs - 1604 - * Implemented pi().

[15:43] <shapr> I think the French culture epitomizes the Greek notion of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. I really admire that facet. It does get irritating sometimes, but I only say that because my fiancee is French and can be very fiery sometimes. ;-)

[15:43] <autrijus> op0 "pi" = const $ return . VNum $ pi

[15:43] <autrijus> iblech++ # very convenient primitive :)

[15:43] <Corion> Sanity check: Does pugs -e "sub ok(){};ok( (!(1 & 2 | 3) < 2, 'ditto');" fail for you?

[15:44] <autrijus> it does because the parens are unbal

[15:44] <Corion> D'oh. Thanks for restoring my sanity! ;)

[15:44] <autrijus> no prob :)

[15:56] <Corion> Grr. In t/operators/precedence.t, line 62: If I replace it with ok((1 & 2 | 3) < 3 , '& binds tighter than |'); , I get a parsefail. But with a stand-alone file, that line works. Commenting out that line makes the .t-file compile as well :-(

[15:56] * Corion questions his Pugs build.

[15:56] <shapr> does it answer?

[15:56] <Corion> r1604, and no, it doesn't talk to me ...

[15:57] <shapr> aww

[16:05] <Corion_> Hm. I think I got the parsefail tracked down. Now I should golf it some more :)

[16:05] <Corion_> ... I can make it appear/disappear by deleteting lines that start with "#" :-)

[16:06] <autrijus> that usually indicates an overeager lookahead.

[16:07] <autrijus> shapr: re: "Practicing the Theories" on LtU

[16:07] <autrijus> "What is a magician but a practicing theorist?" -- Obi-Wan Kenobi

[16:07] <Corion_> autrijus: The bug seems to be caused by having a "#" appear twice on a line. Or something like that, golfing still :)

[16:08] <theorbtwo> Hm?  When did he say that, autrijus?

[16:08] <autrijus> 'Return of the Jedi'

[16:09] <autrijus> not sure of the exact scene. google a bit perhaps

[16:13] <pasteling> "Corion" at 217.86.52.225 pasted "Parsefail with overeager list collector" (11 lines, 101B) at http://sial.org/pbot/8996

[16:13] <Corion_> Should I put that into a test? If so, where/what name? pugsbugs/listquote.t ?

[16:14] <Corion_> ... but that's a really devious parsefail :

[16:14] <theorbtwo> I get an OK on that...

[16:14] <Corion_> theorbtwo: That's weird, because for me it fails. I think. Double checking

[16:14] <shapr> autrijus: oh I like that

[16:15] * theorbtwo too.

[16:15] <Corion_> I'm on r160x, moving to 1605, recompiling.

[16:16] <Corion_> ... and still "prove -v t\pugsbugs\tmp.t" fails for me.

[16:16] <Corion_> (text pasted from pasteling into the test file again)

[16:16] <theorbtwo> Hm, nope.

[16:16] <theorbtwo> ./pugs -MTest -e "ok( (1 | 3) < 3 , 'No parsefail');"

[16:16] <theorbtwo> ok.

[16:16] <theorbtwo> But when I put it in a file, no dice.

[16:16] <Corion_> theorbtwo: Look at my description and the comment line. The comment is important!!!

[16:17] <Corion_> theorbtwo: There is a "<" on the function call, and a closing ">" on the comment line. Pugs sees that as a qw() list.

[16:17] <theorbtwo> Ah, I see.

[16:17] <Corion_> Or at least that's my interpretation of things.

[16:17] <theorbtwo> That's evil.

[16:17] <theorbtwo> But seems likely.

[16:17] <Corion_> theorbtwo: Yes. Like I said.

[16:17] <theorbtwo> Sorry.

[16:17] <autrijus> # in qw() is considered harmful

[16:17] * theorbtwo gets tea for Jess.

[16:17] <Corion_> I have a day of devious discoveries :)

[16:18] <autrijus> perl5 warns ths:

[16:18] <autrijus> Possible attempt to put comments in qw() list at - line 3.

[16:18] <Corion_> autrijus: Then tell me how my pasted test should be written differently :)

[16:18] <Corion_> autrijus: It's a parser bug IMO - look at the test I pasted - I see no better way to write a comparison for "EXPR < 3" :)

[16:18] <autrijus> Corion_: easy; you bug autrijus to fix the parser :)

[16:19] <autrijus> EXPR<3    # this is bad, though

[16:19] <autrijus> the whitespace is significant here iirc.

[16:19] <Corion_> If this does not turn out to be a stupid bug on my part, I'll put that into parsebugs :)

[16:19] <autrijus> go ahead. put it in

[16:19] <Corion_> autrijus: Testing with different whitespace. In the original text it was "->" btw :)

[16:20] <Corion_> No, even with "(1|3)<3" ... ">" I get the parsefail. I'll put it under t/pugsbugs/listquote.t

[16:20] <Corion_> ... but first I need to write some docs for this test, as it is not obvious how the test works ;)

[16:20] <autrijus> I mean

[16:20] <autrijus> EXPR<3> # hash deref

[16:21] <autrijus> EXPR < 3 > ... # comparison

[16:21] <autrijus> the whitespace between EXPR and < is important

[16:21] <autrijus> I think. I may think wrong.

[16:21] <Corion_> autrijus: No - "EXPR < 3 >" does not work as a comparison, or rather, makes no sense :)

[16:21] <autrijus> EXPR<3>-3

[16:21] <autrijus> ;)

[16:21] <Corion_> But there is a difference between HASH<3> and LISTOP < LIST > and LISTOP < EXPR

[16:22] <jabbot> pugs - 1605 - * Added some more tests.

[16:22] <Corion_> autrijus: Yeah, but that should be forbidden / rewritten as -3 < EXPR < 3 ;)

[16:22] <Corion_> Anyway. Describing the test case now :)

[16:23] <autrijus> $a < $b > $c

[16:23] <autrijus> # is legal :)

[16:23] <autrijus> pugs> 3 < 5 > 4

[16:23] <autrijus> bool::true

[16:23] <theorbtwo> I'm not sure if it should be legal.

[16:23] <autrijus> pugs> 3<5>4

[16:23] <autrijus> unexpected "4"

[16:23] <autrijus> pugs got it right here.

[16:23] <autrijus> theorbtwo: spec says it should.

[16:23] <Odin-LAP> Hmmm.

[16:23] <theorbtwo> We have to escape disambuguity somehow, and I think whitespace is not the right way to do that.

[16:24] <Odin-LAP> It has precedent.

[16:24] <autrijus> tell that to @larry? personally I think it makes sense.

[16:24] <Odin-LAP> It makes sense, but looks a bit odd.

[16:24] * castaway brumbles at elisp.

[16:24] <PerlJam> autrijus: are you sure?  3<5> doesn't quite make sense to me.

[16:25] <theorbtwo> 3<5>2 does.

[16:25] <theorbtwo> (Three is less then 5, 5 is greater then 2.)

[16:25] <Odin-LAP> ($a & $c) < $b ?

[16:25] <Odin-LAP> :p

[16:25] <autrijus> yeah.

[16:25] <PerlJam> theorbtwo: right, but that's not what's happening if the 4 is unexpected.

[16:25] <Corion_> Anyone have S\d\d or A\d\d links handy that describe the HASH<X> and A lt B gt C behaviour ?

[16:26] <Corion_> ... so I can put them into the test for further reference ...

[16:26] <PerlJam> theorbtwo: er, 2 in your example

[16:28] <PerlJam> Corion_: isn't hash<x> in S02 ?

[16:29] <Corion_> Ah, but for the remaining tests, I'll simply exchange "< 3" with "!= 3" :)

[16:29] <Corion_> PerlJam: I wouldn't know - it's been about a year since I last looked at them.

[16:29] <Corion_> Anyway - the test is committed, feel free to move and/or add references.

[16:29] <PerlJam> well, chained comparisons is in S03.

[16:30] <Corion_> Anyway - the test is committed, feel free to move and/or add references.

[16:30] <Corion_> Gah. Wrong window. Again.

[16:31] <PerlJam> yeah, %hash<foo> is mentioned in S02. "Use %x<foo> for constant hash subscripts, or the old standby %x{'foo'}."

[16:32] <jabbot> pugs - 1606 - Added listquote ambiguity test

[16:35] <Corion_> PerlJam: Thanks, adding

[16:40] <Corion_> I've added links to the relevant Synopses too (but I can't test them, as I don't have Perl6::Bible installed yet :) )

[16:42] <jabbot> pugs - 1608 - Added links to S02, S03 for listquote.t

[16:42] <jabbot> pugs - 1607 - Fixed operators/precedence.t - one eval 

[16:44] <autrijus> journal up. :) 

[16:44] <autrijus> g'nite!

[16:44] <stevan> g'nite

[16:45] <theorbtwo> G'night.

[16:52] <ninereasons> I wonder why pugs builds so fast on my freebsd machine, and so slow on linux 

[16:53] <ninereasons> the hardware is similar - seemingly not different enough to account for 1:8 

[16:54] <PerlJam> swap drives and see how linux performs on the same hardware

[16:55] <Corion_> Is there the real commit log for Pugs somewhere?

[16:56] <ninereasons> I bet that might be it, PerlJam

[16:56] <chip> journal link

[16:56] <ninereasons> on www.pugscode.org, Corion_ ?

[16:56] <Corion_> ninereasons: Didn't see it there

[16:57] <ninereasons> http://rt.openfoundry.org/Foundry/Project/Source/index.html/pugs/log/

[16:57] <Corion_> chip: That's the distilled version, no?

[16:57] <Corion_> ninereasons: Thanks!!

[16:57] <ninereasons> you're welcome.  It provides RSS too, from the pugscode home page

[16:57] <Corion_> Yeah - I saw the RSS. But that listing doesn't show the affected files with each commit :(

[17:00] <ninereasons> oh.  bummer.  I hadn't used the RSS, but only saw that it was available.

[17:00] <Corion_> Ah well. svn diff -r 1580 seems to show me what I want :)

[17:01] <ninereasons> yes, that's better.

[17:10] *** metaperl__ is now known as metaperl_

[17:10] <Corion_> (according to The Journal)

[17:23] <Corion_> Gah. async{} does not play well with system() it seems. At least not on Win32. So much for testing getprint() against a locally spawned server.

[17:28] <shapr> it's oh so quiet.... it's oh so still....

[17:28] * theorbtwo drops a pin.

[17:31] <Corion_> I'm writing the first test that tests Perl6 external problems. async{} blocks while running a system() call, or the non-happening thereof :)

[17:31] <Corion_> I just don't know if that is to be considered a bug, or unspecced or whatever :)

[17:31] <castaway> shapr!

[17:31] <shapr> castaway!

[17:32] <shapr> oh ye of great isolation!

[17:32] <castaway> *g*

[17:32] <theorbtwo> Great isolation?

[17:32] <Corion_> theorbtwo: You don't count, obviously! :))

[17:32] * theorbtwo reaches out and touches her.

[17:32] <Corion_> That's what the internet is for!

[17:32] <castaway> hmm, count?

[17:33] <shapr> Can you be a castaway if you have internet?

[17:33] <castaway> If a tree falls in the forest .. 

[17:33] <ninereasons> if a castaway drops off the internet, can you hear her screams?

[17:34] <xerox> Ahah, I was writing the same thing

[17:34] <ninereasons> :)

[17:34] <theorbtwo> 1, 3, 5, 4, 2... I can so count!

[17:41] <stevan> Corion_: yes I am 

[17:42] <stevan> Corion_: however, I am not so sure about FindBin.pm,... it looks to be a can of worms

[17:43] <Corion_> stevan: Findbin is broken anyway, see http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=41213 - a simple "File::Spec->canonpath( dirname $0 || cwd );" should be all there is to FindBin

[17:43] <Corion_> (IMO at least)

[17:43] <Corion_> and maybe s!canonpath!rel2abs!

[17:44] <Corion_> stevan: Did you see/backlog my rambling about how I think "use lib;" should behave? That is, "use lib;" is equivalent to 'use lib "$FindBin::Bin/lib"'

[17:45] <stevan> Corion_: yes I did

[17:45] <stevan> however lib serves many other purposes

[17:45] <stevan> (at least I use it for them)

[17:47] <Corion_> stevan: About 90% of my "use lib" use cases could be reduced to "use lib;" by using my way - my way doesn't ruin any other use cases, but maybe it's too uncommon ;)

[17:49] <Corion_> Heh. sleep() doesn't.

[17:49] <Corion_> ... makes testing timing issues interesting ;)

[17:49] <stevan> Corion_: lets see what happens with FindBin, and maybe we can add the special case in there for your usage.

[17:50] <Corion_> Autrijus should learn to get his programs to sleep() for him! That's what computers are for!

[17:50] <Corion_> stevan: The Perl5 FindBin is too convoluted and wrong IMO

[17:51] <stevan> I agree,.. I am going to read this perlmonks post and then try to duplicate the "spirit" of it, rather then the code (much like I am trying to do with CGI.pm)

[17:52] <Corion_> stevan++ # following the spirit, and not the letter

[17:52] <PerlJam> indeed.  stevan++

[17:54] <ninereasons> stevan, playing with hangman.p6, I made the following change, so that I wouldn't have to know exactly where AUTHORS lived

[17:54] <pasteling> "ninereasons" at 199.107.164.126 pasted "more portable?" (22 lines, 528B) at http://sial.org/pbot/8997

[17:54] <pjcj> just be sure to keep NI-S's indentation style ;-)

[17:54] <ninereasons> maybe not pretty, but it worked.

[17:55] <Corion_> ninereasons: For path manipulation, look either at %?CONFIG or File::Spec

[17:56] <Corion_> (instead of hardcoding the path_sep and splitting directories/paths yourself)

[17:56] <Corion_> And File::Spec should also have the updir() method

[17:56] <Corion_> (which returns ".." :) )

[17:56] <ninereasons> yes.  it was in place of rx:perl5/[\w.]+$/

[17:57] <Corion_> ninereasons: Ewwww :)

[17:57] <ninereasons> I think that's still in hangman.p6

[17:59] <stevan> ninereasons: do you have commit access?

[18:00] <ninereasons> yes, but I thought my version was too icky to commit it

[18:00] <stevan> Corion_: actually the whole reason behind lib.pm is so we have use File::Spec in hangman without needing people to have 'make install'ed

[18:00] <Corion_> stevan: Well, I want lib.pm in LWP::Simple too :) And in my programs :)

[18:01] <stevan> ninereasons: hangman is a little ugly anyway, make it use File::Spec and then commit 

[18:03] <shapr> Does hangman ask for big5 occasionally?

[18:04] <stevan> big5?

[18:04] <Corion_> Heh. "time;" seems to have the same parsing problem that "last;" had. Let's see if I can fix that :)

[18:04] <shapr> wait, AUTHORS is utf8

[18:04] <stevan> shapr: yup 

[18:04] <theorbtwo> Yes.

[18:05] <theorbtwo> Well, the last field is.

[18:05] <theorbtwo> Hangman should be smart enough to know where the fields lay, though -- if it doesn't, it's a bug.

[18:05] <shapr> right, ok

[18:05] <theorbtwo> (The rest should be pure ASCII.)

[18:06] <Corion_> Oh. iblech already tests for "time+3" ;)

[18:12] <jabbot> pugs - 1609 - Added test for correct sleep()

[18:14] <stevan> Corion_: I am commiting lib.pm right now, it has tests, but if you want to test it some more in "real world" situations that would be helpful as well

[18:14] <Corion_> stevan++

[18:14] <stevan> Corion_++

[18:14] *** Corion_ is now known as Corion

[18:15] * Corion is currently looking at implementing sleep(). usleep() doesn't seem to return the amount actually slept, right? (also, sleep() and usleep() will suspend all threads, but that's a problem I leave to other people)

[18:17] <shapr> I'd like to call sleep() on myself for a few hours. But I only have enough time for a usleep.

[18:18] <theorbtwo> usleep(2.88e10) ?

[18:22] <jabbot> pugs - 1611 - whoops,... forgot to remove a test

[18:22] <jabbot> pugs - 1610 - adding lib.pm, tests and all (this may s

[18:33] <elmex> hallo

[18:34] <elmex> you're so cute

[18:36] <stevan> shapr: I think he is talking to you :P

[18:39] <elmex> lets have a date

[18:40] <shapr> wha?

[18:40] <ninereasons> bot?

[18:40] <elmex> ninereasons: for no chance i am a bot dude

[18:40] <ninereasons> that's what all the bots say.

[18:41] <ninereasons> :)

[18:41] <elmex> ninereasons: but i can argue about that

[18:45] <Corion> tell me more about it

[18:45] <elmex> lol

[18:46] <stevan> Corion: you said "tell me more about it", what did you mean by that?

[18:46] * stevan considers a perl6 implementation of eliza,... hmmm

[18:47] * elmex considers a perl6 implementation of women

[18:52] <jabbot> pugs - 1612 - lib.pm: adding a few more tests, and mor

[18:53] * Corion wonders what combination of Monads will unpack/repack the thing that Posix.sleep() returns into an Int.

[18:54] <theorbtwo> @type Posix.sleep

[18:55] <Corion> theorbtwo: IO (at least that's what the error message tells me)

[18:55] <Corion> Now, thinking about it, why isn't that "IO Int", but a bare "IO" ?

[18:55] <theorbtwo> Hm, just IO, not IO ()?

[18:56] <Corion> theorbtwo: A naked "IO"

[18:57] <Corion> But the Pugs side of things seems to want a "ContT Val (ReaderT Env IO)"

[18:57] <Corion> Maybe sleep(), even though it comes from POSIX, doesn't return an Int then...

[18:58] <theorbtwo> Ah, the definition I see is sleep :: Int -> IO ().

[18:58] <theorbtwo> But it's hardcoded to fail.

[18:58] <theorbtwo> In any case, it shouldn't take an int.

[18:59] <pasteling> "Corion" at 217.86.52.225 pasted "Implementing a real sleep() builtin" (22 lines, 607B) at http://sial.org/pbot/8999

[19:00] <Corion> theorbtwo: I plan on usleep anyway, and later on threadDelay()

[19:00] <Corion> ... but first I want to get this to compile :)

[19:00] <Corion> (much cargo culted stuff in the paste, of course)

[19:11] <Corion> (much cargo culted stuff in the paste, of course)

[19:11] <Corion> gah :(

[19:18] <Corion> How can I force evaluation of a monad? Or whatever the LHS of <- is called?

[19:20] <shapr> can you give more detail?

[19:20] <Corion> pasting ...

[19:21] <wilx> Use `seq`?

[19:21] <pasteling> "Corion" at 217.86.52.225 pasted "Forcing evaluation of a function (call)" (10 lines, 251B) at http://sial.org/pbot/9003

[19:22] <PerlJam> Corion:  <- evaluates the RHS immediately as I understand things.

[19:22] <shapr> Corion: that looks right to me.

[19:22] <PerlJam> = is lazy, <- is not.

[19:23] <shapr> PerlJam: <- can be lazy, but it depends on the semantics of which monad you're using.

[19:23] <shapr> IO isn't lazy.

[19:23] <theorbtwo> <- is lazy in Eval, though... I think.

[19:23] <Corion> Hmmm. Why doesn't my code sleep then ? :( It doesn't delay with either "sleep()" or "threadDelay()"

[19:23] <PerlJam> shapr: well, there goes a little bit of haskell I thought I knew!

[19:23] <Corion> I'm using (from the Pugs side of things) pugs -e "for (1..10) { say$_; sleep 1}"

[19:23] <integral> <- just turns into a >>= + a lambda, PerlJam.  It's syntactic sugar.  It's up to the way you define the functions (or operators) that determines the strictness

[19:23] <Corion> Aaah - maybe the value I want is not being passed in properly ?

[19:24] <Corion> I should maybe first hardcode the sleep interval, just to make sure...

[19:24] <shapr> Corion: that part also looks right tome

[19:24] <shapr> yeah, good idea

[19:25] <shapr> If val is lazy...

[19:25] <Corion> I get the warning that "slept" is ignored, and that suggests to me that "slept" will also never be calculated... And it doesn't sleep with a hardcoded value either.

[19:26] <gaal> hey all

[19:26] <shapr> In that case, you're right, it's not sleeping =)

[19:26] <Corion> Hi gaal!

[19:27] <gaal> i'm improving. total time coding sitting at my own desk at work today: 2 hrs

[19:27] <Corion> ... connection resetting soonish, DNS has already failed :) BRB

[19:29] <shapr> Yes, you need to seq the monadic call, but I can't think of how to do it at the moment.

[19:30] <shapr> I like wilx' suggestion, try `seq` or $!

[19:30] <shapr> Doesn't seem quite right though.

[19:32] * theorbtwo checks in some more of External/Haskell.hs.

[19:32] <jabbot> pugs - 1613 - More work on haskell embedding -- still 

[19:32] <theorbtwo> (Try forcing compiling with -debug, then do ./pugs +RTS -Dl -RTS -e 'require_haskell("")'

[19:33] <PerlJam> Hrm..  /me gets email from a departing part-time worker that responses she gets from another full-timer to her questions often sound "insolent" and "condescending"

[19:34] <shapr> PerlJam: is that good?

[19:34] <PerlJam> I'm not sure what to make of it.

[19:35] <PerlJam> She says the only reason she's speaking up now is because she's leaving.

[19:35] * theorbtwo wonders if the coworker was being condescending because the former coworker was asking stupid questions.

[19:35] <wilx> Hmm.

[19:35] <PerlJam> theorbtwo: possibly, but still. 

[19:35] *** Corion_ is now known as Corion

[19:36] <PerlJam> theorbtwo: the latest question she asked in email was "does anyone know of a way to automatically convert from asp to php?"  is that a stupid question?

[19:36] <shapr> I wish everyone were confident enough to speak their mind, and doubtful enough to listen to correction. (I wish I were more like that, mostly)

[19:36] <wilx> Remember it, if anybody else expresses the same opinion, well...

[19:36] <wilx> Dunno what to do next :)

[19:36] <PerlJam> shapr: me too

[19:37] <PerlJam> (i wish you were more like that ;)

[19:37] <theorbtwo> Fairly.

[19:37] * shapr laughs

[19:37] <theorbtwo> ASP isn't a language.

[19:37] <shapr> PerlJam: If I were more doubtful, I'd believe you :-P

[19:37] <PerlJam> theorbtwo: So a lack of understanding == stupidity?

[19:37] <theorbtwo> Depends on what her job was.

[19:39] <PerlJam> theorbtwo: there's a researcher with an oracle database and an ASP web-app that she's converting to use postgresql and apparently php.

[19:39] <theorbtwo> If someone was hired as an expert C programmer, but doesn't know how to use printf, then there's a problem.

[19:39] <Corion> ASP is mostly like PHP. Except where it differs ;) It's more a templating system I think, but with tag-macros

[19:39] <PerlJam> She was hired as an expert mathematician and computer geek.  But she's not very knowledgable about many things that you or I would take for granted  (she's more math geek than computer geek)

[19:40] <theorbtwo> OK, then that may be a reasonable question to ask.

[19:40] <shapr> Last I worked with it, ASP used windows scripting host so you could embed any WSH language in the jsp-style <% code %> tags.

[19:40] <theorbtwo> OTOH, she should realize that converting between things that are simply isomorphic isn't aways simple.

[19:41] <integral> iirc ASP could do both jscript and vbscript since before wsh

[19:41] * theorbtwo hopes he's using the term "simply isomorphic" correctly.

[19:41] <shapr> When was wsh first introduced?

[19:41] <PerlJam> theorbtwo: my answer was "the automatic way to do it is to hire a programmer who knows both and filter through his brain"  ;-)

[19:41] <Corion> WSH is merely the command line/text file interface to the general script interpreters.

[19:41] <Corion> If things are isomorphic, there is no need to actually perform the translation, at least for a mathematician.

[19:42] <PerlJam> theorbtwo: also, http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FogBugzIII.html

[19:42] <theorbtwo> Oh, you are the coworker she was complaigning about?

[19:42] <shapr> Wasn't there a chili-something company/product that ran ASP on linux/apache ?

[19:42] <PerlJam> theorbtwo: no, she was actually complimenting me on how nice my answers are compared to the other guy.

[19:42] <PerlJam> shapr: yeah, chilisoft.

[19:43] <PerlJam> er, perhaps chillisoft

[19:43] <PerlJam> both look odd 

[19:43] <Corion> chilloutsoft?

[19:44] <shapr> In any case, I suspect a Parsec parser could convert all the asp source files to php-compatible files, but she'd likely have to port the scripting language code to php manually.

[19:44] * shapr hugs Parsec

[19:44] <PerlJam> shapr: or she could just compile to an AST and then write a translator from the AST to php.  et voila!  ;-)

[19:45] <Corion> Heh. My Haskell code has about the same amount of $ chars as my Perl code. :))

[19:45] * shapr snickers

[19:45] <Corion> . o O ( create a polyglott Haskell / Perl program )

[19:45] <integral> the perl will have more () though ;-)

[19:45] <shapr> Corion: that would be scary.

[19:46] <Corion> integral: Naah - function calls don't necessarily need parentheses in Perl either ;)

[19:46] <PerlJam> and you don't often chain them like in haskell

[19:46] <Corion> shapr: In Perl, a variable $foo can be written as "$ foo" :-)))

[19:46] <shapr> whoa, nifty

[19:47] <Corion> shapr: Together with the fact that "--" is a Haskell comment, this will make for a funky polyglott program (if it's possible at all)

[19:47] <PerlJam> in perl*5*, not perl6

[19:47] <Corion> Yeah - I'm talking P5 too :)

[19:47] <Corion> p5 4 life, dawg!

[19:47] <PerlJam> Corion: i'm just clarifying as this is #perl6 you know :)

[19:47] <Corion> p6 4 Inf!

[19:47] <Corion> PerlJam: :)))

[19:48] * Corion shakes his fist at Haskell. Sleep, dammit, sleep!

[19:48] <shapr> Corion: can you lift the sleep call into Val?

[19:48] <Corion> shapr: via liftIO ? Gotta try ...

[19:50] <Corion> If you tell me how to convert a "m ()" into a "Val", I think I'm set %-}

[19:51] * Corion tries a pure Haskell program, to see if threadDelay() works at all :)

[19:52] * PerlJam just notices the "so" operator in Prim.hs

[19:53] <Corion> "make it so" ? :)

[19:54] <PerlJam> indeed.

[19:54] <PerlJam> op0 "so" = const (return $ VBool True)

[19:54] <Limbic_Region> chip about?

[19:54] <Limbic_Region> seen chip

[19:54] <jabbot> Limbic_Region: chip was seen on Thu Apr  7 00:56:20 2005

[19:54] <chip> *bamf*

[19:54] <Limbic_Region> http://use.perl.org/~Bernhard/journal/24044

[19:54] <castaway> silly jabbot, whose TZ?

[19:55] <Limbic_Region> FYI - Parrot related use.perl journal entry

[19:56] <chip> Thanks.

[19:56] <theorbtwo> jabbot: seen castaway

[19:56] <jabbot> theorbtwo: castaway was seen on Thu Apr  7 03:54:42 2005

[19:57] <theorbtwo> That TZ.  (Taiwan time, I think.)

[19:58] <Limbic_Region> yup (http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/) - That TZ

[19:58] <chip> I'm suggesting Parse::RecDescent in place of antlr.

[19:58] * Limbic_Region doesn't know enough about either to recommend either for a particular task

[19:59] <Limbic_Region> when I finish with HOP, I am going to write an SQL parser in P::RD to get a better handle on it though

[19:59] <jdv79> how is HOP?

[20:00] <chip> P::RD is what I used to parse U.S. mailing addresses.  It's good.

[20:00] <chip> foo bar 100 main st apt 4 bite me -> "100 MAIN ST" "APT 4"

[20:00] <Limbic_Region> jdv79 - what I have gotten to read so far, very good

[20:00] <Limbic_Region> problem is - personal life is full ATM and work is well - work

[20:01] <PerlJam> Limbic_Region: screw it all and work on pugs!

[20:01] <PerlJam> or parrot

[20:01] <Limbic_Region> PerlJam - I have sworn off Pugs/Parrot/Perl6/Ponie etc until after Jean and I move into the new house

[20:02] <Limbic_Region> either that or until I win the lottery - in which case I am going to personally fund major developers to devote full time to the 4 Ps

[20:02] <Limbic_Region> in the interim, I am content to lurk and putting people in touch with information that may be important to them

[20:03] <Limbic_Region> see - the people doing all the hard work don't have any time to find out what hard work other people are doing - I don't do anything except read about all that hard work and point people to each other

[20:03] <Corion> I found P::RD too fragile and slow - it made me switch to the dark side that is Parse::YAPP

[20:03] <integral> There's also Dan Sugalski's journal entry that suggests it's slow

[20:04] <Corion> (and by "slow" I meant that it took more than 5 seconds to parse some basic JS three liner)

[20:04] <Limbic_Region> well, Damian was supposed to make it faster in 2.0 but has abandoned that for greener pastures

[20:04] <integral> (unmaintained modules)--

[20:04] <Corion> Parser writing is better left to people who do it as part of their studies :)

[20:04] <Limbic_Region> there is nothing saying someone else can't implement the pos() fix themself though

[20:05] * Limbic_Region didn't know that tmoertel was so close (in PA)

[20:06] <Limbic_Region> I haven't looked at the source of P::RD and have no idea how much work it is to implement the optimizations, but complaining about it being slow without looking is a lot like complaining about using map in a void context (which turned out to be a 3 line patch)

[20:06] <gaal> um

[20:06] <gaal> i looked at it once

[20:06] <integral> the module is a couple of thousand lines longs, and rather dense

[20:07] <gaal> making it faster would take more than three lines.

[20:07] <Corion> Limbic_Region: I wouldn't have switched form a recursive descent parser to something yacc-based if the problems hadn't been too big. :)

[20:07] <Limbic_Region> gaal - not saying it wouldn't.  Just that Damian isn't the only smart person out there

[20:07] <gaal> (even sent damian a patch)

[20:07] <Corion> integral: The problem is, the module is distributed in its unmaintainable, converted form instead of the "P::RD" source.

[20:07] <gaal> (not to make it faster though)

[20:07] <Limbic_Region> damian-- then

[20:08] <stevan> Limbic_Region: I think it is more the approach to parsing,.. recursive descent is known to be slower than some of the other approaches

[20:08] <integral> Corion: interesting, I thought about that, but didn't think someone would be that annoying ;-)

[20:08] <Corion> but recursive descent creates the nicest automatic error messages

[20:08] <gaal> webgrep for dan's note on improving parsing speed

[20:08] <Corion> integral: I don't know if it was on purpose

[20:09] <gaal> he has a few practical tips

[20:09] <integral> Corion: well converting it would be on purpose, and I would think he'd realise that it would make patching tricky

[20:09] <Limbic_Region> http://www.urth.org/~metaperl/domains/semantic-elements.com/perl/prd/dans-blog/000235.html

[20:09] <Corion> integral: Conversion can only take place if you already have P::RD, so he has to send out a converted version. But yes, it makes patching tricky (and drove me away)

[20:10] <gaal> exaactly

[20:10] <integral> well one can still include bits like that in the tarball

[20:10] <metaperl_> that is part of Parse::RecDescent::FAQ

[20:11] * gaal zzzzz&

[20:12] <Limbic_Region> in any case, writing my SQL parser (completely toy project) in P::RD will help me to understand the issues better (and perhaps even motivate me to offer patches)

[20:13] * Corion gives up on implementing sleep() :(

[20:13] <Corion> ... but then, it's almost time to catch some myself

[20:17] <CosmicRay> shapr: thanks for the ParseDate suggestion.  It is *exactly* what I'm looking for.

[20:17] <CosmicRay> err wrong channel sorry

[20:42] <jabbot> pugs - 1614 - use File::Spec for hangman dictionary

[21:24] <Juerd> What the hell is Larry up to? Does anyone know?

[21:24] <Juerd> If so, can you warn me about what is to come?

[21:37] <rootmj> I just created some small stupid part of p6-pugs-source-code (*.p6)  to html-tutorial generator. http://wiki.kn.vutbr.cz/mj/attach/pugs/tut/ . good night

[22:39] <kungfuftr> yullo all

[22:45] <kungfuftr> what's this about a new auto-smoke program?
