[15:00] <Limbic_Region> hmmm - all is quiet on the frontier

[15:10] <pdcawley> Is ^ the new Â¢?

[15:11] <Limbic_Region> I seem to recall $larry indicated that it might be a suitable replacement

[15:13] * Limbic_Region is still looking through the "new sigil" thread to see if he recalls correctly

[15:14] <Limbic_Region> nope I didn't

[15:14] <Limbic_Region> Eric wrote: Actualy i think ^ might be my favorite so far.

[15:14] <Limbic_Region> to which Larry replied

[15:14] <Limbic_Region> I thought that, too, until I realized it wouldn't work as an rvalue:

[15:16] <pdcawley> Do we know what it's *actually* going to get called? ISTR that ongoing discussion of that lead to the conclusion that it could be made to work as an rvalue, at the expense of something else not quite working.

[15:16] <pdcawley> Of course, now I can't find the bloody messages.

[15:16] <Limbic_Region> to be quite frank, at 97 messages deep, I stopped paying attention to the thread

[15:16] <pdcawley>  Thee and me both.

[15:21] <Limbic_Region> I know this is an awful thing to say, but I really hope that Pugs and Parrot get to the point where they have working implementation of everything specced to date and can say come on @larry - your holding up progress

[15:22] * Limbic_Region ducks after mentioning he is severly under the weather and may or may not be in his right mind

[15:25] <pdcawley> Oh, absolutely.

[15:25] <pdcawley> I do rather admire Larry's ability to avoid nailing anything down until the last possible minute, but...

[15:26] <theorbtwo> ...but sometimes there are a distinct lack of last possible minutes.

[15:27] <pdcawley> Heh.

[15:27] <pdcawley> His knack of finding the underlying complexity is also bloody useful, if a little hard to follow sometimes.

[15:39] <Limbic_Region> well - the thing that is terribly frustrating is a simple straight forward question doesn't get answered with a simple straight forward response - a thread is allowed to spin off into tangents having little to nothing to do with the original question

[15:40] <Limbic_Region> I am not suggesting moderation

[15:40] <Limbic_Region> I wouldn't want to hamper creativity

[15:41] <Limbic_Region> it would just be nice that once a thread finally dies to have some from @larry write a summary response of the thread about all the things that were pulled out that were decidely good and decidely bad

[15:41] <Limbic_Region> as well as a position on the original question

[15:41] <Limbic_Region> pointing someone to a 97 message thread when the same question gets raised a month from now doesn't do anyone any good AFAIC

[15:45] <theorbtwo> I think rather easier to implement would be some sort of community tagging system.

[15:53] <xinming> seen autrijus 

[15:53] <jabbot> xinming: autrijus was seen 1 days 9 hours 45 minutes 56 seconds ago

[15:55] <pdcawley> Limbic_Reason: Propose it on the list?

[16:07] <PerlJam> bah!

[16:07] <PerlJam> Limbic_Region: come back!

[16:07] * PerlJam trys the summoning charm

[16:09] <PerlJam> If someone is around when he comes back, tell Limbic_Region that just because a thread dies on p6l, doesn't mean anything was resolved.  It may be that @Larry are still working on it and they don't /know/ what was good or bad yet.

[16:10] <dakkar> is autrijus on-line?

[16:11] <xinming> dakkar: I don't think so, He might be at work

[16:11] <dakkar> ok, I'll manage

[16:18] <theorbtwo> Xinming: "He" is lowercase in English except when refering to godlike creatures, or at the beginning of a sentance, BTW.

[16:19] <theorbtwo> PerlJam: True enough, I suppose, but it does seem often as if at least a tentitive decision has been reached, and nobody notices because it's buried deep in a thread that most people have long sinced ceased to care about.

[16:20] <PerlJam> theorbtwo: seems xinming used "He" appropriately because he was referrint to autrijus :-)

[16:21] <PerlJam> theorbtwo: The problem is that all decisions are tentative and other, seemingly unrelated things, can cause them to change.

[16:23] <ajs_> Actually, "He" is only capitalized in english when refering to monotheistic deities. For example, you would say, "Zeus wanted to approach without causing alarm, so he became a swan."

[16:24] <PerlJam> theorbtwo: It's like this--most of us are looking at things "in the small".  We're focused on one particular bit of syntax or feature set or whatnot.  @Larry, and particularly $Larry, has to make sure that things work "in the small" and "in the large".  It's that whole-language viewpoint that prevent decisions from being easy or final or whatever and thus a little bit vague for us mere mortals.

[16:24] <theorbtwo> ajs: He is also properly capatalized when refering to kings.

[16:24] <ajs_> Yes, that's correct. Forgot about that one.

[16:25] * PerlJam imbues autrijus with god-like powers of capitalized pronouns.

[16:25] <theorbtwo> Yeah... but it would be nice if there was some place to look and see "this is what we think today".

[16:25] <theorbtwo> Need to put away groceries, BBIAB.

[16:26] <PerlJam> theorbtwo: What makes you think that would be nice?

[16:26] <ajs_> Is that "autrijus does CapPronouns" or "autrijus but CapPronouns"? Do we get a new developer with all of autrijus' productivity, but uppercase He, or just a modification in usage?

[16:28] <PerlJam> "Here's the amorphous pulsating mass of our thought right now.  Never mind the bits sticking out at odd angles or the localized warped laws of physics.  Oh, and BTW  Here Be Dragons, so caveat transitus"  or something like that.

[16:30] <xinming> PerlJam: Thanks for pointing out the mistake I made. >_<, hmm, In my understanding. the sentence after a ',' is indicated finished. So, I will upper case "he"

[16:30] <xinming> xinming dakkar: I don't think so, He might be at work

[16:30] <xinming> clear? there is a ',' after so. :-P

[16:31] * xinming is considering if he need to change all ',' into '.'

[16:31] <theorbtwo> Comma is a pause within a sentance, not a seperator between sentances.  Sometimes things can be either -- but you should either use a period and a capital, or a comma and lowercase.

[16:31] <PerlJam> xinming: sentences are terminated with . (period).   Commas (,) are used as a pause

[16:33] <xinming> hmm, ok, for this example. `So, i will go` or `So, I will go` which is correct by the way?

[16:33] <theorbtwo> "I" is always uppercase in English, including in "I'll".

[16:33] <PerlJam> xinming: For some reason unknown to me, the pronoun "I" is always capitalized.

[16:34] <xinming> got it, thanks. :-)

[16:35] <ajs_> How much optimization will be allowed for chained "but"s? Will intermeditate metaclasses get folded? Is that legal?

[16:36] <PerlJam> ajs_: I've always thought the chained buts would be like the other "listfix" operators and you'd get exactly one new class created (i.e., there are no intermediate classes)

[16:38] <theorbtwo> OTOH, I'd simply say that it seems like a legal optimization, in as much as the intermediate classes would have been inaccessable anyway, and thus there is no way to tell if they were optimized away or not.

[16:38] <ajs_> So that's a yes on folding. Ok, good. That's what made sense to me, but in some strange cases, there are semantic differences, so I wasn't sure if it was going to be legal.

[16:38] <theorbtwo> Can you give me an example where there would be a semantic difference?

[16:41] <ajs_> theorbtwo: Well, any time there is behavior associated with instantiation, you'll get differences based on the number of times it's called. Remember that semantically, those buts are instantiating a new metaclass, class and object.

[16:41] <ajs_> Ew... and I think you have to call destructors on the intermediate objects too...  gah

[16:42] <theorbtwo> Ugh.

[16:42] <theorbtwo> Yeah, you're right.

[16:42] <theorbtwo> It'd be a nontransparent optimization.

[16:42] <ajs_> Where if we just declare that chained buts are always subject to folding at the compiler's whim, you are not bound by those rules.

[16:44] <ajs_> I'll fire that off to p6l for confirmation

[16:44] <theorbtwo> Exactly.

[16:44] <theorbtwo> OTOH, Larry saying things like print **1... being gaurnteed to use up your memory as a side effect /scare/ me.

[17:19] <PerlJam> theorbtwo: why?

[17:20] <PerlJam> perl has to build the list somewhere.  The RAM made available by the OS seems a good place to do that :)

[17:22] <r0nny> yo

[17:25] <theorbtwo> PerlJam: It's not allowed to detect "hey, somebody just told me to steamroll an infinite list", and die without trying to eat infinite memory?

[17:26] <PerlJam> theorbtwo: it could ... but that's an optimization  ;-)

[17:33] <xinming> http://tnx.nl/php

[17:34] * xinming feels lucky for that he didn't learn PHP.

[17:42] <skugg> xinming: don't. it's wonderful for learning by elimination.

[17:59] <Andy> hi kids

[18:00] <obra> Hey andy

[18:01] <Andy> Hey, Mr. Project Manager!

[18:01] <Andy> I just got pinged by an editor at a publisher looking for dates on P6.

[18:02] <theorbtwo> Andy: Floating-point seconds since the beginning of Jan 1, 2000.

[18:02] <obra> theorbtwo: on, not in ;)

[18:02] <obra> Andy: what sorts of dates are they looking for?

[18:02] <Andy> Do you know what the latest is about the Perl 6 release? Do you have a                                               

[18:02] <Andy> best-guess release date? Is it this year? Some time next year?  

[18:02] <obra> And how much are they looking to pay to get a set schedule?

[18:02] <obra> So. We're looking to deliver a first-class language at an incredibly low price.

[18:03] <obra> You can guess which variable we have to play with.

[18:03] <theorbtwo> If $publisher is interested in Perl 6 comming out sooner, they should hire Larry to work on perl 6.

[18:05] <obra> Seriously, though, there's lots of good stuff happening on Parrot and PGE

[18:05] <obra> But I don't feel that speculating on dates when we don't have funding commitments is in anybody's best interests.

[18:06] <xinming> :-)

[18:07] <xinming> Andy: No matter how much the publisher paid. I don't think perl 6 will be release with the schedule date.

[18:08] <xinming> s/with/within/

[18:09] <Limbic_Region> theorbtwo - I am not so sure their interest in making it come sooner

[18:09] <Limbic_Region> I think the interest is more in approving new books on p5 and when to start approving books on p6

[18:10] <theorbtwo> Yeah, I also figured more that they want to know when more then they want it to be soon.

[18:10] <Limbic_Region> there are several books out now covering p6 and likely they will all be mostly useless when the first alpha release comes out

[18:10] <Limbic_Region> well of course they want to time supply with demand - that's just common sense

[18:11] <sili> good old p6...

[18:11] <theorbtwo> 1;

[18:11] <xinming> Limbic_Region: agreed. :-)

[18:11] <theorbtwo> But the best way to know when something will happen is to make it happen.

[18:12] <theorbtwo> (Thus the PR problems with market-based predictions on terrorisim and the like.)

[18:12] * Limbic_Region is on the phone

[18:19] * Limbic_Region is back but sees that the conversation is dead

[18:20] <Andy> Back

[18:21] <Andy> Nobody is asking for "coming out sooner."

[18:21] <Andy> Just estimated dates, if any.

[18:21] <Andy> If the answer is "we have no idea", then the answer is "we have no idea."

[18:21] <obra> Right. And that's what I won't do. I know better.

[18:21] <Andy> What won't you do?

[18:21] <obra> estimate a release date.

[18:21] <Andy> You're saying you won't put an estimated date on it?

[18:21] <Andy> OK.

[18:21] <Andy> So the answer is "No, we don't have any dates."

[18:22] <obra> Right.

[18:22] <Andy> That's what I'll relay back.

[18:22] <obra> Ok

[18:24] <Limbic_Region> Andy - the FAQ used to have an estimated release date

[18:25] <obra> The best parallel I can think of is Mozilla

[18:25] <obra> Took them long enough to get a decent 1.0 that everyone had completely written them off.

[18:25] <Limbic_Region> I see that it has been removed - likely because it said 3rd quarter 05

[18:25] <Andy> Do you have anything that you WOULD be willing to throw a date on?

[18:25] <Andy> Some milestone that they can hang a hat on?

[18:26] <Limbic_Region> Andy - TPF has milestones associated with the stuff that grants were given for

[18:26] <Andy> TPF = me.

[18:26] <obra> Right. and those milestones are work-based, not date based.

[18:26] <Andy> That's why I'm asking this.

[18:26] * Limbic_Region knows that

[18:26] <obra> We've moved away from date-based milestones.

[18:26] <Andy> ok

[18:26] <obra> Because they weren't possible to accurately estimate with the resources we have.

[18:26] <Limbic_Region> oh I know I know

[18:27] <obra> It's largely a volunteer project.

[18:27] <Limbic_Region> you could always use the Pugs timeline image

[18:27] <Andy> obra: You don't have to explain all this to me.  I understand the problems.

[18:27] <obra> Right. then why are you asking the question?

[18:27] <Andy> Because I wanted to know if you had dates.

[18:28] <Andy> I'm not saying "Dammit, Jesse, gimme some dates."

[18:28] <Limbic_Region> oh, you is the collective Pugs team?

[18:28] <obra> Actually, you are.

[18:28] <Andy> I'm not!

[18:28] * Limbic_Region was just saying that even if Pugs/Parrot were to have all the functionality currently spec'd, we would still be waiting on @larry to finish the design

[18:29] <Andy> I asked if you had some.  You said no.  I'm fine with that.

[18:29] <Andy> I asked if there were any on milestones that were not "Perl 6 is done", you said no.  I'm fine with that, too.

[18:29] <obra> no. you asked if there were dates for those milestones.

[18:29] <obra> we've got milestones.

[18:29] <Andy> Right.

[18:29] <Andy> And you said no there were no dates.

[18:30] <Andy> And I'm fine with that.

[18:30] <Andy> I'm really not demanding dates.

[18:30] <Andy> It would be absurd if I were to presume to do so.

[19:02] <theorbtwo> pdcawley: Thanks for the summary -- it was a good one.

[20:40] <Limbic_Region> seen autrijus

[20:40] <jabbot> Limbic_Region: autrijus was seen 1 days 14 hours 33 minutes 19 seconds ago

[20:40] <Limbic_Region> hmmm - any FP fanatics out there may enjoy the inciting of a holy war - http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=450922

[20:48] <SamB> we don't do holy wars.

[20:48] <SamB> unly pure wars!

[20:48] <SamB> also lazy wars.

[20:48] * Limbic_Region chuckles

[20:50] <xinming> I love peace, So keeping away from the war...

[20:51] <xinming> These wars is tedious, I ever met a person who only knows about Windows, and said the market will tell us which is better. :-/

[20:55] <SamB> well, in lazy wars nobody ever gets around to doing any fighting

[20:55] <SamB> and in pure wars nobody can do anything, because if they did it would be impure

[20:56] <SamB> I suppose maybe we could bring ourselves to have monadic wars

[20:59] <theorbtwo> We can warp the structure of time, but only if we can fail?
