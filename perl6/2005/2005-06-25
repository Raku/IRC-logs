[00:00] <castaway> luckily he couldnt see me from there ;)

[00:00] * castaway has plenty of pics of herself ,)

[00:00] <Odin-LAP> Poor thing.

[00:01] * Odin-LAP has too many.

[00:03] <Darren_Duncan> castaway, what's your name?  I can't find "castaway" in the AUTHORS

[00:04] <Darren_Duncan> ditto Odin-LAP; I can't find that in the AUTHORS; your name?

[00:05] <Odin-LAP> Not present. :>

[00:05] <theorbtwo> DD: she should write something, so she can go in AUTHORS in good faith.

[00:05] *** Limbic_Region_ is now known as Limbic_Region

[00:05] <Darren_Duncan> sure

[00:06] <theorbtwo> Jess Robinson   (CASTAWAY)

[00:06] <Darren_Duncan> I half-assume that everyone on this channel has or will contribute something

[00:06] <norstar2> Greetings

[00:06] <Darren_Duncan> maybe to clear things up we should have a separate file of people on #perl6 that aren't yet qualified to be in AUTHORS

[00:07] <theorbtwo> Oh, nope, Jess "castaway" Robinson    (JROBINSON)  

[00:07] <theorbtwo> DISTUNIGUISHEDLURKERS

[00:07] <norstar2> Darren, are you a Perl 6 programmer?

[00:07] <Darren_Duncan> yes

[00:07] <norstar2> Do you work on Pugs?

[00:07] <Darren_Duncan> my main contribution to Pugs is in writing Perl 6

[00:08] * castaway is not present in AUTHORS

[00:08] <Darren_Duncan> both attempting to make Perl 6 modules run on it, and writing tests

[00:08] <Limbic_Region> theorbtwo - have all the glitches that got exposed after your patch (or the majority of them anyway) get fixed?

[00:08] <theorbtwo> Yes, but if you were, that would be your entry.

[00:08] <Darren_Duncan> I'm not a Lambda

[00:08] <castaway> distinguished?

[00:08] <theorbtwo> Limbic: I think so.

[00:08] <Limbic_Region> I am back to using svk and am going to attempt latest pugs to file some bug reports against

[00:09] <Darren_Duncan> sometimes also participating in this channel and p6l about what the langauge should look like and/or having it clarified

[00:09] * theorbtwo so needs a better laptop.

[00:09] <castaway> Darren, why were you looking? ;)

[00:09] <Darren_Duncan> sometimes knowing a person's real name can tell a bit more about them

[00:10] <Darren_Duncan> online handles are so un-descriptive

[00:10] <theorbtwo> Depends on the handle, and the name.

[00:10] <Darren_Duncan> sure

[00:10] <theorbtwo> Real names really tell you more about a person's parents.

[00:10] <Darren_Duncan> when I say 'handle', I mean those that don't resemble real names

[00:10] <Odin-LAP> And the person in question!

[00:10] <Darren_Duncan> I always use my real name on the internet and never made an alias

[00:11] <Odin-LAP> theorbtwo: Oooh, like patronymics? ;p

[00:11] <theorbtwo> "theorbtwo" tells you that I' the sort of person who would name himself theorbtwo.

[00:11] <castaway> hmm, what do real names tell you, if anything?

[00:11] <castaway> (it can give an idea as to nationality etc, but apart from that?)

[00:11] <Odin-LAP> Darren_Duncan: Here's the question: Aren't handles *more* descriptive, since they tend to be self-chosen?

[00:11] <Darren_Duncan> they can often tell you a person's gender and culture, sometimes age too

[00:12] <Darren_Duncan> depends what one wants to know I suppose

[00:12] <castaway> interesting, so which am I of those? ;)

[00:12] <Odin-LAP> Indeed.

[00:12] <theorbtwo> "James Mastros" just tells you that my parents are the sort of people that would name me "James Mastros".

[00:12] <castaway> (not tha theorbtwo didnt already give one away)

[00:12] <Darren_Duncan> you explicitly said you were a female earlier

[00:12] <Darren_Duncan> in your comment about having too many pictures

[00:13] <castaway> hmm, so I did.. ,)

[00:13] <Odin-LAP> "Whoops."

[00:13] <Odin-LAP> ;)

[00:13] <geoffb> Perhaps a better question is, "Why is your nick <foo>?"  That would probably tell you the most, assuming they answered honestly

[00:13] <Darren_Duncan> to be honest, given just a handle, I have to assume that everyone here is a male until I know otherwise, given that is likely the majority

[00:13] <castaway> geoffb:  I dunno, there are so many reasons

[00:13] <castaway> fine by me

[00:13] <Odin-LAP> Darren_Duncan: Ooooh. Let's just hope you don't run into any extreme feminists. ;)

[00:14] <geoffb> castaway, shoot . . . (see, now this already sounds interesting)

[00:14] <theorbtwo> (Even that tells you a lot... like it's not "No purticular reason".)

[00:14] <castaway> I even get that when people know my name 

[00:14] <Darren_Duncan> when I say "assume", I mean "image in the head associated with the handle"

[00:14] <castaway> geoffb:  nope, waiting for Darren to guess first ,)

[00:14] <castaway> (since it probably gives another one away ,)

[00:14] <Darren_Duncan> I don't actually tell people someone is one or the other since I don't spread misinformation on purpose

[00:15] <Darren_Duncan> who wants me to guess what?

[00:15] * theorbtwo doesn't have to worry too much about spreading misinformation on castaway.

[00:15] <castaway> culture and age.. mine that is

[00:16] * castaway notes as an aside, that she currently cant tell who is emoting what, since it comes up white on white ,)

[00:16] <geoffb> OK, going with the probabilities -- white, late 20's to early 40's

[00:17] <Darren_Duncan> notes as an aside that I explicitly turned those stupid yellow ball smiley graphics off on my client because I abhor them

[00:17] <castaway> geoffb: is your nick Darren? ;)

[00:17] <castaway> Darren, me too

[00:17] <geoffb> castaway, heh

[00:18] <Limbic_Region> bah - now pugs fails to build

[00:18] <Limbic_Region> grrrrrrr

[00:18] <Darren_Duncan> castaway, the name Jess Robinson suggests someone from a European-style culture, in answer to your question

[00:19] <Darren_Duncan> as for sex, its hard to tell because at least half the names out there can be applied to one of either kind; wouldn't know if you hadn't said

[00:20] <Odin-LAP> European-style? English-speaking, moreover!

[00:20] <castaway> lucky for you that happens to be correct

[00:20] <castaway> (yeah "European" is anyone of many many cultures)

[00:20] <Darren_Duncan> by contrast, some names stand out as being middle-eastern or asian etc

[00:20] <castaway> otoh that places you firmly on the NA continent, Darren ,)

[00:21] <Darren_Duncan> suffice it to say, I only said a real name helps "a little more"

[00:21] <castaway> (I find one can get a lot more from incidental conversation than names)

[00:21] <castaway> and ges?

[00:21] <Darren_Duncan> certainly, but that takes time

[00:21] <theorbtwo> Limbic_Region, fails how?

[00:21] <castaway> sure, I was just curious

[00:21] <Limbic_Region> perlbot nopaste

[00:21] <perlbot> Paste your code here and #<channel> will be able to view it: http://sial.org/pbot/<channel>

[00:21] <Darren_Duncan> to be honest, I have a poor memory for people, that aside from a small handful, I won't remember in an hour who said what here

[00:22] <pasteling> "Limbic_Region" at 24.35.57.240 pasted "like this" (37 lines, 2.6K) at http://sial.org/pbot/11330

[00:22] <Darren_Duncan> same in real life, difficulty with names and faces

[00:22] <theorbtwo> Likewise, DD.

[00:22] <Darren_Duncan> my memory is a lot better with spacial or mathematical things

[00:22] <theorbtwo> Whee.

[00:23] <theorbtwo> No clue what would cal^Huse that.

[00:23] <castaway> oops, I meant "and age" back there

[00:23] <theorbtwo> cause that.

[00:23] <Darren_Duncan> eg, after I go to OSCON this year, I should be able to draw a map of the conference center from memory several years later

[00:23] <Darren_Duncan> example of spacial that was

[00:24] <Limbic_Region> so it is bombing out on Prelude.hs on a fresh checkout

[00:25] <Limbic_Region> fresh as in I reformatted the harddrive 

[00:25] <Darren_Duncan> so, out of those talking here right now (last 10-20 mins), who's going to OSCON 2005?

[00:25] <theorbtwo> What does your Prelude.hs contain?

[00:25] * castaway nudges theorbtwo

[00:25] <castaway> (query window)

[00:25] * theorbtwo wonders why he's being nudged?

[00:25] <castaway> thats pretty drastic, Limbic ,)

[00:26] <Darren_Duncan> separate question: what do you do in your IRC client to change the appearance of your handle in posts when you are self-describing

[00:27] <Darren_Duncan> (my client shows a bullet to the left of the handle)

[00:27] <Limbic_Region> castaway - I didn't really format it - but for all intents and purposes that partition was wiped

[00:28] <geoffb> Darren_Duncan, do you mean '/me does foo'?

[00:28] <Darren_Duncan> lets test that theory ...

[00:28] * Darren_Duncan testing a theory

[00:28] <Darren_Duncan> that seems to have done it

[00:28] <Darren_Duncan> thanks

[00:28] <geoffb> sure

[00:28] <Limbic_Region> theorbtwo - I have two - different sizes

[00:28] <Limbic_Region> you want the one that was bombing out obviously

[00:28] <Darren_Duncan> now I just have to remember for next time

[00:28] <Limbic_Region> silly me

[00:29] <Darren_Duncan> original question: is anyone here going to OSCON 2005?

[00:30] <pasteling> "Limbic_Region" at 24.35.57.240 pasted "Prelude.hs" (27 lines, 3.1K) at http://sial.org/pbot/11331

[00:30] <castaway> not me, Darren

[00:30] <theorbtwo> OK, if it's 27 lines, it's probably riht.

[00:31] <Darren_Duncan> I'm hoping I'll like it ... especially given the CDN$2200 or so I'll be spending to go

[00:31] <Limbic_Region> it is 27 lines

[00:31] <Limbic_Region> and blowing up perfectly

[00:32] <Darren_Duncan> now away from comp for a bit

[00:32] <castaway> geoffb: my favourite song at the time was "Message in a Bottle", btw (and it seemed to fit some too)

[00:32] <castaway> my .plan was/is the chorus from that song

[00:34] <castaway> *nudge*

[00:37] * Odin-LAP plants a ten kilogram nugget of plutonium wrapped in primed HE in the middle of the channel.

[00:37] <Odin-LAP> s/nugget/sphere/ # perhaps..?

[00:38] <castaway> (so either he is in Canada, or OSCON is.. and since thats in Portland..)

[00:38] <Darren_Duncan> YAPC::NA is in Canada, OSCON isn't

[00:38] <castaway> and you?

[00:38] * Limbic_Region is taking his recent troubles even getting pugs to run as a sign and decides to call it a weekend

[00:39] * castaway hugs Lim	

[00:39] <castaway> oops

[00:39] <Darren_Duncan> if you're asking me, I'm at home in BC, Canada

[00:39] <Limbic_Region> when are you and your better half coming back castorbaway?

[00:39] * castaway hugs Limbic_Region

[00:39] * Limbic_Region hugs back

[00:39] <theorbtwo> To Lancaster, tomorrow.

[00:39] <castaway> back to PA, tomorrow

[00:39] * castaway ponders who was the better half, and who the asked, there ,)

[00:39] <Limbic_Region> ok - what dates were you looking at possibly getting together?

[00:40] <castaway> anytime between Sun and Thurs

[00:40] * Odin-LAP wonders why nobody's scared of the fat man.

[00:40] <Limbic_Region> Odin-LAP - I am both fat and scary

[00:40] <castaway> afaik we're planned thurs afternoon/evening and flying back to munich fri

[00:41] * Odin-LAP triggers the nuke.

[00:49] <castaway> nuffin! ,)

[00:53] <nothingmuch> huh?

[00:54] <castaway> wot?

[01:01] <castaway> (an IRC proxt would certainly be useful here)

[01:01] <castaway> proxy even

[01:19] <azuroth> hey

[01:20] <azuroth> is the parrot cvs borken? is this the right place to ask?

[01:54] <theorbtw1> az: No, ask on irc.perl.org/#parrot.

[02:25] <castaway> nope

[02:25] <geoffb> yep

[02:27] <geoffb> Do they answer back?

[02:27] <castaway> fraid not

[02:28] <geoffb> damn shame.  Be interesting to hear what they had to say

[02:28] <castaway> I'm not sure it would, y'know ,)

[02:28] * geoffb does `svk pull` again and hopes for the best . . . "And this time, with FEELING."

[02:29] <geoffb> A nice cryptic answer perhaps -- " Y - E - S "

[02:30] <castaway> so very prologish

[02:30] * geoffb imagines the monks receiving Deep Thought's answer from the BBC HGTTG

[02:31] <castaway> s:)

[02:37] <geoffb> What does the s indicate?  Hairstyle?

[06:52] * mugwump notes that http://lists.utsl.gen.nz/pipermail/pugs-commits/2005-June.txt makes a nice patch file

[06:58] <arcady> that's just too convenient...

[08:29] <Alias_> Hi folks, how's the hackathon going?

[08:51] <Juerd> autrijus: In your journal, where you say "chomped part", don't you mean "what's left after chomping"?

[08:51] <Juerd> autrijus: I'd think the "chomped part" would be the "\n" part

[10:37] * pdcawley_ reads autrijus's latest journal entry and applauds wildly. Go larry1

[10:37] <pdcawley_> s/1/!/

[12:05] <cognominal> can you access svn.openfoundry.org?

[12:10] <meppl> no

[12:11] <meppl> but the mirror  http://svn.perl.org/perl6/pugs/  is online

[12:12] <nothingmuch_> Juerd: autochomping behavior will cause the FH to return a subclass of String

[12:13] <nothingmuch_> but otherwise $foo behaves like a normal string, that is missing the EOL marker

[12:13] <nothingmuch_> like ChompedInput or something like that

[12:13] <nothingmuch_> and then you can say $foo.newline to get back the part that was chomped off

[12:13] <nothingmuch_> and you can make a filehandle return an unchomped, nonmagical string by passing it an adverb
