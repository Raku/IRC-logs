[07:39] * geoffb staying up with fussy infant while spouse gets blessed, blessed sleep

[08:16] <geoffb> Oh for heaven's sakes.  In frustration at slow and/or impossible pugs builds, I finally order a new machine (for the first time in years) as a replacement development box.

[08:16] <webmind-> heh

[08:17] <webmind-> perl6 is good for the computer industry

[08:17] <webmind-> :)

[08:17] <geoffb> After spending an entire day doing research and comparison of each and every part, I finally slap the credit card down, and then go to check the usual tech sites for some fun reading -- only to find that they just updated their buyer's guides for the first time in ages.

[08:18] <geoffb> Sigh.  I guess now I get to see if I made the right decisions.  :-)

[08:18] <webmind-> heh

[08:18] <geoffb> webmind: heh -- I was thinking earlier that I've proven that Perl 6 is good for the economy.  :-)

[08:36] <nothingmuch> From autrijus 's journal: "Container equivalence test =:= distinguished from object identity test eqv."

[08:36] <nothingmuch> UGH!

[08:37] <nothingmuch> eqv is *not* generic equality?

[08:37] <nothingmuch> why is =:= useful at all?

[08:39] <nothingmuch> http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/22952

[08:41] <autrijus> eqv is by default obj ident

[08:41] <autrijus> but you can override it to mean generic eq

[08:41] <nothingmuch> and that sucks

[08:41] <nothingmuch> =(

[08:41] <nothingmuch> for Int  and so forth

[08:41] <nothingmuch> culturally, i mean

[08:42] <autrijus> maybe Int does override eqv to mean value eq.

[08:42] <nothingmuch> i don't know wtf is going on in @Larry>>.head WRT to equality testing

[08:42] <autrijus> and I don't know what's the expected use case of =:= either.

[08:42] <nothingmuch> it's the most inconsistent, non newbie friendly semantics i've ever seen

[08:42] <nothingmuch> there is some backwards compatibility, which I can understand, but 'eqv', 'equals', '=:=', and so forth... why?!

[08:43] * nothingmuch sighs heavily

[08:44] <autrijus> bbiab...

[09:00] <Aankhen``> geoffb: What's the config of the machine you ordered?

[09:03] <nothingmuch> iblech: ping

[09:03] <nothingmuch> or anyone, actually

[09:03] <nothingmuch> i have perl in /usr/local/bin/perl and /usr/bin/perl

[09:04] <geoffb> Aankhen``, designed to be fast, but also give me good programming habits.  So: Athlon 64 X2 3800+, 2 GB OCZ Platinum, MSI Neo4/SLI Platinum, XFX 7800 GTX OC, etc.

[09:04] <nothingmuch> i'd like to use /usr/local/bin/perl for all things pugs (running makefile, config, smoke server client, pil run)

[09:04] <nothingmuch> # ./pugs -w t/rules/from_perl6_rules/combchar.tPerl lib version (v5.8.6) doesn't match executable version (v5.8.1) at /usr/local/lib/perl5/5.8.6/darwin-thread-multi-2level/Config.pm line 32.

[09:05] <geoffb> Aankhen``, oh, and quiet.  Did my best to spec quiet moving parts.

[09:05] <geoffb> We'll see how well it works

[09:05] <Aankhen``> Wow.

[09:05] <Aankhen``> Niice stuff.

[09:05] <geoffb> When you only upgrade a couple times a decade, you store up the lust.  :-)

[09:06] <broquaint> /usr/local/bin/perl Makefile.PL # Perhaps, nothingmuch?

[09:06] <geoffb> This box should be literally an order of magnitude faster than the old box

[09:06] <geoffb> nothingmuch, you know, I think broquaint is right, actually.

[09:07] <Aankh|Clone> Weird...

[09:07] <Aankh|Clone> [14:35:33] <geoffb> When you only upgrade a couple times a decade, you store up the lust.  :-)

[09:07] <geoffb> nothingmuch, though I seem to recall that some pugs tests try to do their own harness-facsimile and get it wrong

[09:07] <Aankh|Clone> [14:35:38] <Aankhen``> Heh.

[09:07] <Aankh|Clone> [14:35:55] <Aankhen``> Are you getting two graphics cards?

[09:07] <Aankh|Clone> Last I got.

[09:07] <geoffb> Those last two lines you sent I didn't get before.

[09:07] <geoffb> And no -- for now, just the one, though I specifically got an SLI board in case of later upgrade

[09:07] <Aankh|Clone> Ah, I see.

[09:07] <Aankh|Clone> What about storage?

[09:09] <geoffb> Using a still-in-packaging 200 GB Seagate 7200.7 SATA I had laying around.

[09:09] <Aankh|Clone> Mmm.

[09:09] <geoffb> Nothing special, but importantly: quiet.

[09:09] <Aankh|Clone> Seems a little wimpy for the specs.

[09:09] <Aankh|Clone> OK.

[09:09] <Aankh|Clone> Does your work require minimum noise, or is it just your preference?

[09:10] <geoffb> Oh sure, wimpy, but like I said, quiet -- and why buy a new drive, when you already have a SATA drive lying around gathering dust?

[09:10] <Aankh|Clone> Buy one more 200 GB drive and put them in RAID 0, then buy two 500 GB drives and put them in RAID 1. :-

[09:10] <Aankh|Clone> D

[09:11] <geoffb> My office has 6-10 computers running at any given time, many of them too old to be designed for anything resembling quiet.  It gets annoyingly loud.

[09:11] <geoffb> I'm slowly replacing the loudest boxes with new quiet ones

[09:11] <Aankh|Clone> I see.

[09:12] <geoffb> Re: RAID drives -- heh.  Well, the case has room, and the chipset can do (though IIRC under linux most chipset raid is actually slower than software raid)

[09:14] <Aankh|Clone> What's the whole thing costing you?

[09:15] <geoffb> Too much, and thankfully a lot less than it would be if I didn't already have a few of the parts and peripherals I needed.

[09:15] <Aankh|Clone> Heh.

[09:15] <geoffb> The monitor for one, glad I didn't have to include that this time around, sheesh.

[09:16] <Aankh|Clone> I need a new monitor... one which can do 1280x1024 at more than 60 Hz. :-\

[09:17] <Aankh|Clone> I've thought of upgrading mine very often, but the thing is, buying another 17" one seems really stupid, and I don't have the desk space for anything larger.  Oh, and LCDs are way beyond my reach.

[09:17] <geoffb> a few months ago, I finally just had had it with wimpy resolution, and mothballed my LCDs to return to the land of a big (and HEAVY) CRT

[09:17] <Aankh|Clone> LOL.

[09:18] <wolverian> I have a five year old Nokia trinitron display, 17". It is still better than any LCD I've seen.

[09:19] <wolverian> (I run it at 1280x1024. That's the only bad side - resolutions above that go below 85Hz)

[09:19] <Aankh|Clone> Lucky you.

[09:19] <Aankh|Clone> Once we go abroad, I'm not buying a monitor smaller than 24". :-P

[09:20] <geoffb> An Apple Cinema display is a truly gorgeous thing, but it's A) expensive as hell (especially the 30", which also requires a high-end video card to drive it), and gets the gorgeous color by having crap response time

[09:20] <Aankh|Clone> http://www.go-l.com/

[09:20] <Aankh|Clone> Go look at their Athens displays.

[09:21] <geoffb> Whee, pugs build finishes, I can launch firefox again . . . :-/  (THIS WOULD BE WHY I'M GETTING A NEW BOX)

[09:21] <Aankh|Clone> LMAO.

[09:21] <Aankh|Clone> http://www.go-l.com/monitors/athens/features/index.htm

[09:21] <Aankh|Clone> More specific link.

[09:23] <geoffb> As soon as FF pages in, I'll take a look.  :-)

[09:23] <geoffb> And BTW, if you do go the CRT route, I've been happy with my NEC FP2141SB.

[09:24] <Aankh|Clone> That sounds familira.

[09:24] <Aankh|Clone> Familiar, even.

[09:24] <Aankh|Clone> Hm

[09:24] <Aankh|Clone> .

[09:25] <Aankh|Clone> Ah.

[09:25] <geoffb> It was recommended in a few buyer's guides, which is what led me to it

[09:25] <Aankh|Clone> It was one of the displays I considered for my dream machine some years ago. :-)

[09:25] <Aankh|Clone> Then I replaced it with a 61" plasma display (also from NEC).

[09:25] <geoffb> In your dreams, or in RL?

[09:25] <Aankh|Clone> Dreams.

[09:27] *** Aankh|Clone is now known as Aankhen``

[09:27] <Aankhen``> My kingdom for a Libermann!

[09:28] <Aankhen``> http://www.go-l.com/_images/hdspeed_machl_3.8_full.gif

[09:28] <geoffb> Wow, that Athens display is a beaut.  Two nits: 1) What in the world video card(s) are needed to run it, and 2) I see a lot of buzzwords in the specs, without very man actual *specs*

[09:28] <geoffb> er, very many

[09:28] <Aankhen``> Yeah, they're good at hiding specs. :-)

[09:29] <Aankhen``> I believe those displays are meant to be used only with other L systems.

[09:29] <Aankhen``> Might be mistaken, though...

[09:31] <geoffb> crazy stuff

[09:31] <Aankhen``> Yup.

[09:32] <Aankhen``> $17,000 dollars for one of those, apparently.

[09:33] <geoffb> I remember many years ago, just after the 386 came out, there was a company that would sell you a complete gold-coated system, with hydraulic lifts for the case cover.

[09:33] <Aankhen``> Yowza.

[09:34] <geoffb> They were aiming to sell directly to the CEO who wanted to have it on or next to his desk as a status item, but never actually use it.

[09:34] <Aankhen``> Hehe.

[09:34] <geoffb> And they didn't really pull many punches in the marketing.  It was pretty much "You know you want it.  You've got the cash, here's the bling."  Before bling meant anything, of course.

[09:35] <nothingmuch> geoffb: re software raid:

[09:35] <nothingmuch> the only scenario where HW raid is significantly faster than software raid is when there are mirrorred drives on the same bus

[09:36] <nothingmuch> that way SW raid has to send the data as many times as there are drives, but a HW raid gets the data once, and then passes it to each drive later on

[09:36] <geoffb> nothingmuch, I assume that's specific to PC chipset RAID?

[09:37] <nothingmuch> uh, say again?

[09:37] <geoffb> My understanding was that if you drop a grand or two on "real" HW raid, it just wins hands down.  But most of the time, that's not what people are using.

[09:37] <nothingmuch> oh

[09:37] <nothingmuch> right

[09:37] <nothingmuch> i'm talking in theory

[09:37] <geoffb> They have what their chipset vendor calls HW raid.

[09:38] <geoffb> ah, gotcha.

[09:38] <nothingmuch> sw raid and hardware raid do the same thing

[09:38] <nothingmuch> it's just where is it done

[09:38] * geoffb is just OT boy tonight . . . 

[09:39] <nothingmuch> sw raid is potentially much faster since it probably has a more expensive (and faster) processor and bus

[09:39] <geoffb> True . . . though in the super-high-end case, the CPU gets to stay pretty damn idle.

[09:39] <nothingmuch> to do the pairty checks, CRCs, data transfers, and so on

[09:39] <geoffb> nod

[09:39] <nothingmuch> now, super high end cases just have the same (or good enough) quality stuff packed behind a single interface

[09:39] <nothingmuch> the CPU treats it as one physical disk

[09:39] <geoffb> My rule of thumb is:  If you can drop 5 digits on NAS or a FC enclosure, great.  Otherwise don't bother.

[09:40] <nothingmuch> right

[09:40] <geoffb> nothingmuch, nodnod

[09:40] <geoffb> sadly, I am not yet rich enough to have a nice NAS box at home.  :-)

[09:41] * nothingmuch would be worried about the electric bill too

[09:41] <geoffb> heh

[09:41] * nothingmuch is very happy with two drives, 80, and 120

[09:41] <nothingmuch> LVM on top of that

[09:41] <nothingmuch> and sw raid on top of LVM

[09:41] <geoffb> actually, my biggest problem in this office is not the electric bill (which does suck), but rather the overheating.

[09:41] <nothingmuch> so i have stripping for the crap data, like movies (not that I download any, uh...)

[09:41] <geoffb> When it's hot outside, it gets toasty in here.

[09:41] <nothingmuch> and for home dirs, /var, and so forth i have mirrorred raid

[09:41] <nothingmuch> eep

[09:42] <geoffb> And $spouse hates it when I turn on the AC to cool the office, thereby leaving the office below 80 and the rest of the house below 70.

[09:43] <nothingmuch> heh

[09:43] <geoffb> And adding a big pile to the electric bill, to boot.  :-)

[09:43] <geoffb> I definitely fear the heat that the new box is going to cast off.

[09:43] <nothingmuch> geoffb: then why not let the boxes breathe outside air?

[09:44] <geoffb> Um . . . because it's even hotter outside during August -> October?

[09:44] <nothingmuch> the boxes can handle it.

[09:45] <nothingmuch> but the people in the house might not =)

[09:45] <geoffb> heh

[09:46] <nothingmuch> wow.... osx's launch agent thingies are tres cool

[09:46] <nothingmuch> it's like inetd + inittabs + gentoo rc system

[09:46] <nothingmuch> all rolled into one

[09:46] <geoffb> Oh, since I've got you on the line, nm: any chance of updates to harrorth any time soon?  I'm passing time reading docs on Forth and Joy waiting.  :-)

[09:47] <nothingmuch> geoffb: we're finishing the rennovation any day now

[09:47] * geoffb still using 10.3 on the house OS X box . . . 

[09:47] <nothingmuch> then I should have more free time

[09:47] <geoffb> cool.

[09:47] <nothingmuch> i also want to cut back on work hours a bit

[09:47] <geoffb> Good on ya!

[09:47] <nothingmuch> and since summer vacation schedule is now being phased out, that should be easy too

[09:48] <nothingmuch> that way I can get back in shape, since I can bike when it's still day

[09:48] <geoffb> ?

[09:48] <nothingmuch> and then i'll have less fatigue

[09:48] <nothingmuch> which means less TV

[09:48] <nothingmuch> and more interesting stuff

[09:48] <geoffb> nodnod

[09:48] <geoffb> I know just how that goes

[09:48] <nothingmuch> the dust and the cleaning and the hours are really getting to me =(

[09:48] <geoffb> I'll bet

[09:49] <geoffb> toddler + infant hours are getting to me . . . *yawn*

[09:49] <nothingmuch> try waking up before toddler

[09:49] <nothingmuch> it's hard to start, but it makes sense once you get the habit

[09:50] <geoffb> That used to work great.  And then the infant was born.

[09:50] <nothingmuch> oh, i see

[09:50] <nothingmuch> what are ages of said infant and toddler?

[09:50] <geoffb> Baby is not yet sleeping more than 3 hours at a time.  And the 3 hour blocks occur totally randomly, no way to know that it won't be only a 1.5 hour block

[09:51] <nothingmuch> eep

[09:51] <geoffb> 2 1/2 weeks and 2 1/4 years

[09:51] <gaal> hello.

[09:52] <geoffb> ah

[09:52] * gaal is back from a vacation. naturally i need another one :)

[09:53] <nothingmuch> heh

[09:53] <nothingmuch> got pictures?

[09:53] <gaal> soon!

[09:53] <nothingmuch> hurrah

[10:01] <geoffb> Out of curiosity, has anyone ever tried to figure out why GHC eats so much memory compiling pugs?  I mean, what particular constructs might be triggering poor memory behavior, or if any Haskell program of its size would do the same?

[10:03] <broquaint> Scary autrijus voodoo I would imagine.

[10:06] <geoffb> Sure, I'm just wondering if there is some low-hanging fruit to be picked

[10:07] <gaal> geoffb, probably #haskell will know, but i bet ghc itself takes oodles of RAM as well.

[10:09] <geoffb> perhaps I will ask there when I have the brain power to understand the answer.  :-)

[11:06] <keithalexander> hi, I am trying to learn to use perl cgi but I get Forbidden

[11:06] <keithalexander> You don't have permission to access /~keithalexander/first.cgi on this server. Can someone show me the error of my ways?

[11:09] <nothingmuch> chmod a+x ~keithalexander/first.cgi

[11:09] <nothingmuch> but this channel is not concerned with apache or CGI

[11:09] <nothingmuch> or even the perl you are probably running

[11:09] <nothingmuch> this is for perl 6 development and discussion

[11:09] <keithalexander> okay, sorry, that's true

[11:09] <nothingmuch> as for cgi's not being executed - that has to do with the setup that the server is doing

[11:09] <nothingmuch> not with perl

[11:09] <nothingmuch> you should ask your system administrator for help if setting execute permissions is not enough

[11:10] <nothingmuch> only they can really know what's really stopping it from working, we can only make educated guesses

[11:10] <keithalexander> yes, sorry

[11:10] <nothingmuch> no sweat =)

[11:10] <broquaint> What's a good linux mp3 player? XMMS 1.2.10 crashes after 30 mins or so of radio streaming :/

[11:10] <nothingmuch> the problem eappears to be that the cgi script is set with permissions that don't allow the server to execute it

[11:11] * broquaint curses irssi and it's wacky interface

[11:11] <nothingmuch> irssi++

[11:11] <nothingmuch> ;-)

[11:11] <broquaint> irssi-- # Makes me look stupid, which is meant to be a *state secret*.

[11:11] <nothingmuch> =)

[11:12] * nothingmuch learns not to keep half empty turkish coffee glasses on his desk for the 4th time this week

[11:12] <broquaint> Although I'll still suggestions on decent linux mp3 players ...

[11:12] * nothingmuch used mplayer on osx for a while

[11:13] <broquaint> Thanks, nothingmuch :)

[11:15] <gaal> broquaint, mpd is great.

[11:15] <gaal> musicd it's sometimes called

[11:15] <gaal> it's client-server

[11:16] <gaal> pick your client (cli, curses, x11)

[11:16] <gaal> works great with large collections

[11:16] <gaal> doesn't shut down music when you exit x

[11:16] <gaal> etc.

[11:16] <broquaint> Cool stuff, thanks, gaal :)

[11:16] <broquaint> Sounds smart.

[11:16] <gaal> np :)

[11:46] <autrijus> greetings :)

[11:46] <gaal> hello autrijus-san!

[11:46] <autrijus> heya gaal

[11:47] <autrijus> how's life?

[11:47] <gaal> landed a few hours ago :)

[11:47] <autrijus> geoffb: ram consumption on Pugs.Run is due to precompiled prelude

[11:48] <gaal> how're you? how's pugs? haven't backlogged yet (scared to :)

[11:48] <autrijus> geoffb: otherwise, it's just GHC -O is known to be slowish. "make unoptimised" will nix that

[11:48] <autrijus> but I don't think there's easy low hangingness

[11:48] <autrijus> gaal: I'm also still backlogging :) but see my journal for the first half

[11:48] <autrijus> tonight I'll post the other half

[12:08] <gaal> nothingmuch, ping

[12:47] <nothingmuch> =074xpong

[12:47] <nothingmuch> gaal: pong

[12:47] <gaal> pics up

[12:47] <nothingmuch> url me

[12:48] <gaal> http://gaal.livejournal.com

[12:50] <nothingmuch> yummy: http://pics.livejournal.com/gaal/pic/000564k1/g5

[12:50] <gaal> nice madrase, yes

[12:50] <nothingmuch> http://pics.livejournal.com/gaal/pic/0000d9et/g3 =)

[12:51] <gaal> there's a story behind that one, heh, but i wonder if i should tell it here :)

[12:51] <nothingmuch> tell tell

[12:52] <gaal> well, we went to this nice lake 2 hours from Trabzon called Uzun Gol

[12:52] <gaal> (Goel, heh.)

[12:53] <nothingmuch> sounds like tolkenish names =)

[12:53] <gaal> and my friend forgot the camera and his cell phone on a rock

[12:53] <gaal> Turkish is a very interesting language btw - must be cool to learn it

[12:54] <gaal> so anyway - we discovered the loss only after the drive back

[12:54] <nothingmuch> ooh: http://pics.livejournal.com/gaal/pic/000226zx/g4

[12:54] <gaal> and tried calling the phone several times, but got no answer

[12:54] <gaal> so the day later we hopped on the bus again and looked for it with no luck

[12:55] <gaal> that's the sweetest yayla we found 

[12:55] <nothingmuch> yayla?

[12:55] <gaal> so just before giving up we tried calling one more time, and a guy answered in turkish, knew no english

[12:56] <gaal> a passerby near the public phone booth helped us communicate

[12:56] <gaal> he said sure, i can give you back your stuff but i'm not here right now

[12:56] <nothingmuch> what's happenning here? http://pics.livejournal.com/gaal/pic/0002t0q8/g4

[12:56] <gaal> he travelled two hours by car just to give it back

[12:57] <gaal> sunset

[12:57] <nothingmuch> wow, that's nice

[12:57] <gaal> slightly foggy weather

[12:57] <nothingmuch> ah, that explains the fuzzyness

[12:58] <gaal> yes, those pics are real nice for a pretty simple camera! (entry level digital kodak, ~3mp)

[12:58] * nothingmuch would have been mui embarraced

[12:58] <nothingmuch> i love this kind of scenery: http://pics.livejournal.com/gaal/pic/0003s422/g4

[12:58] <gaal> by what, the camera guy or the foggy picture? :)

[12:59] <nothingmuch> the foggy picture

[12:59] <nothingmuch> this looks like a collage: http://pics.livejournal.com/gaal/pic/0003zqzd/g4

[12:59] <gaal> well, let me know when you decide to go :)

[12:59] <nothingmuch> very cute =)

[13:00] <gaal> that's the highest summit in the background in that one

[13:02] <nothingmuch> gaal: so how did you go?

[13:02] <nothingmuch> like, what route

[13:02] <nothingmuch> with what vehicles, or lack thereof

[13:02] <gaal> the most significant parts were by foot, about ten days

[13:03] <gaal> i'll tell you when i write about it :)

[13:04] <nothingmuch> =)

[13:04] <nothingmuch> ugh... /me has gotten no work done today... =(

[13:06] <nothingmuch> given $brain.state { when Stuck { $perl6_channel.complain } }

[13:39] <nothingmuch> Subject: Shocking family pics and video!

[13:40] <nothingmuch> Daughter d1dn?t want her daddy t0 be her Ist man, but d@d @lways <acy></acy>gets what he wants, even if he has to take it by force?nobody asked <acu></acu>for her opinion?<BR>

[13:40] <nothingmuch> OH YES! INCEST PORN! AND VIOLENT TOO! BUY BUY BUY!

[13:43] <stevan> hola gaal 

[13:43] <gaal> stevan!

[13:43] <nothingmuch> moose!

[13:43] <stevan> are you the guy with no hair?

[13:43] <gaal> wapiti!

[13:43] <gaal> one of them :)

[13:43] <stevan> looks like a great trip

[13:43] <stevan> nice scenary

[13:44] <gaal> wonderful actually

[13:44] <gaal> very nice people in the mountains too

[13:45] <gaal> excuse me as i will now find something to eat

[14:08] <svnbot6> r6624 | fglock++ | * perl5/ Array,Hash - added pairs,kv,keys,values

[14:12] <stevan> fglock: FYI - I added multi-methods to the MM 2.0 using Class::Multimethod::Pure

[14:15] <fglock> stevan: how is it doing? can I use it for Code?

[14:32] <svnbot6> r6625 | fglock++ | * PIL-Run - Hash: keys, values, kv, pairs

[14:32] <svnbot6> r6625 | fglock++ |   - Array: keys, values -- but no kv, pairs

[14:38] <svnbot6> r6626 | fglock++ | * PIL-Run - Array::zip(), Array::kv()

[14:40] <stevan> fglock: it is slow, but seems to be working

[14:41] <stevan> fglock: take a look at t/08_multi_methods.t

[14:42] <fglock> I'm reading it :)

[14:42] <fglock> do you think I can start using MM2?

[14:43] <stevan> fglock: I would like to get more tests for it first

[14:44] <stevan> my $work project just launched today,.. so I should have more tuits very soon

[15:08] <svnbot6> r6627 | fglock++ | * PIL-Run - add support for printing unboxed values

[15:14] <svnbot6> r6628 | fglock++ | * PIL-Run - stringification checks for AUTOLOADed str()

[15:19] *** Arathorn is now known as Aragone

[15:28] *** wilx` is now known as wilx

[15:33] <svnbot6> r6629 | fglock++ | * perl5/ PIL-Run, etc.

[15:33] <svnbot6> r6629 | fglock++ |   - Added support for unboxed Pair.key, Pair.value

[15:33] <svnbot6> r6629 | fglock++ |   - Array.pair() passes some tests

[15:33] <svnbot6> r6630 | fglock++ | * perl5/Array - pairs() passes all tests

[15:45] <svnbot6> r6631 | fglock++ | * PIL-Run - Array::pick()

[16:18] <winningsperm> is there a perl equivalent to phpinfo() ?

[16:20] <wolverian> is there a PHP equivalent for some_function_you_have_never_used()?

[16:20] <wolverian> you might want #perl, not #perl6, too. :)

[16:20] <wolverian> (or efnet #perlhelp, which can be sometimes helpful as well.)

[16:37] <jrussell> hiya everyone.

[16:37] <jrussell> does anyone know what File::Find find() returns?

[16:39] <autrijus> nothing terribly useful.

[16:39] <autrijus> probably undef in all cases

[16:40] <jrussell> so what should i use if i want to see if "filename.txt" exists in a particular directory?

[16:40] <autrijus> -e "/path/filename.txt"

[16:40] <jrussell> i mean inside a code

[16:40] <autrijus> my $exists = -e "/path/filename.txt"

[16:40] <jrussell> oh right ... cheers matey. let me try that out

[16:41] <autrijus> np.

[16:42] * geoffb (sortof) awake again

[16:42] <geoffb> from backlog:

[16:43] <geoffb> autrijus, yeah, I knew which phases were RAM killers (having watched top in horror during quite a few builds) -- I just don't understand why the bad phases (esp. PCP and link) are that bad.

[16:44] <autrijus> PCP is because it's huge

[16:44] <geoffb> I'll take your word for it that there is no low-hanging fruit though, and just pine for my new box until the parts arrive

[16:44] <svnbot6> r6632 | fglock++ |  * PIL-Run - implemented lazy Array::sum

[16:44] <svnbot6> r6632 | fglock++ |    (1,2,3,100..100000).sum = 5000045056

[16:44] <geoffb> (and I manage to get time to assemble them)

[16:44] <autrijus> it's 1.8M of source code

[16:45] <geoffb> autrijus, sure, but should 1.8M of source result in hundreds of times that much RAM during compile?

[16:45] <geoffb> It's like GHC is not able to GC or something

[16:45] <autrijus> another thought is to force -O0 on that file.

[16:45] <geoffb> Oh, this is *with* -O0

[16:45] <wilx> Heh.

[16:46] <wilx> 1.8M of source code in one file?

[16:46] <jrussell> oh cheers autrijus! it worked!

[16:46] <geoffb> I've never been able to compile an optimized build

[16:46] <autrijus> wilx: it's Prelude.pm compiled to haskell form

[16:46] <geoffb> wilx, autogenerated so to speak

[16:46] <wilx> That _is_ humungous.

[16:51] <jrussell> hmm .. is there an elegant way in perl to remove a file instead of using `rm filename`

[16:51] <wolverian> perldoc -f unlink

[16:51] <autrijus> and #perl :)

[16:52] <jrussell> ahhh thank you!

[16:54] <geoffb> In the last couple days, there has been a huge increase in people asking #perl questions here . . . .

[17:02] <svnbot6> r6633 | Stevan++ | Perl6::MetaModel 2.0 - porting some tests from 1.0

[17:08] <svnbot6> r6634 | fglock++ | * PIL-Run - fixed Ref constructor, stringification

[17:32] <svnbot6> r6635 | fglock++ | * PIL_Run - (1,2,3) Y (4,5,6)

[17:38] <jrussell> one more question ... this -e "/path/filename" to test if the 'filename' exists in the path given. what's this -e

[17:38] <jrussell> i haven't heard of it before

[17:38] <svnbot6> r6636 | fglock++ | * PIL-Run - sin, cos, tan, sqrt

[17:38] <gaal> perldoc -f -X

[17:39] <jrussell> oh right :-) thank you

[17:39] <gaal> np :)

[17:44] <svnbot6> r6637 | fglock++ | * PIL-Run - implemented unary '-'; sign()

[17:50] <svnbot6> r6638 | fglock++ | * PIL-Run - chr, ord

[18:01] *** khisanth_ is now known as Khisanth

[19:02] <svnbot6> r6639 | iblech++ | * t/subroutines/lvalue_subroutines.t: Added tests for sub*refs* used as

[19:02] <svnbot6> r6639 | iblech++ |   lvalues and fixed a test (non-rw subs should die when used as lvalues).

[19:02] <svnbot6> r6639 | iblech++ | * New t/statements/for_with_only_one_item.t: for ($only_one_item) {...},

[19:02] <svnbot6> r6639 | iblech++ |   see also http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/22970.

[19:02] <svnbot6> r6639 | iblech++ | * New t/operators/array_interpolation.t: ~("a ", "b") should *not* be "a  b",

[19:02] <svnbot6> r6639 | iblech++ |   but "a b", see the test for relevant S02 paragraph.

[19:02] <svnbot6> r6639 | iblech++ | * t/operators/operator_overloading.t: Don't overload &prefix:<-> globally, as

[19:02] <svnbot6> r6639 | iblech++ |   we don't want to mess runtime internals (affects at least PIL2JS, PIL-Run

[19:02] <svnbot6> r6639 | iblech++ |   probably as well).

[19:02] <svnbot6> r6639 | iblech++ | * t/var/default_scalar.t, t/unspecced/cwd.t, t/examples/examples.t:

[19:02] <svnbot6> r6639 | iblech++ |   skip tests needing IO if $*OS eq "browser"

[19:08] <svnbot6> r6640 | iblech++ | * Usual svn props.

[19:08] <svnbot6> r6640 | iblech++ | * PIL2JS: Misc. minor fixes.

[19:08] <svnbot6> r6640 | iblech++ |   * Prelude::JS::ControlFlow: for "abc" {...} works now.

[19:08] <svnbot6> r6640 | iblech++ |   * Prelude::JS::Rules, new Prelude::JS::Smartmatch:

[19:08] <svnbot6> r6640 | iblech++ |     $any ~~ $string works now.

[19:25] * Aankhen`` goes to sleep.

[19:25] <Aankhen``> G'night.

[19:25] <svnbot6> r6641 | fglock++ | * PIL-Run - log, log10; added warning messages

[19:31] <svnbot6> r6642 | fglock++ | * PIL-Run - uses Perl6::Value::numify()

[19:43] <svnbot6> r6643 | fglock++ | * perl5/Hash - fixed calculation of hash keys

[19:58] <autrijus> whew. today's journal only took 3 hours

[19:58] <autrijus> I _think_ I'm now readonably caught up.

[19:59] <autrijus> "reasonably"

[19:59] <autrijus> bad mental auto completion.

[20:00] <autrijus> journal up. see you tomorrow :) &

[20:01] <fglock> bye autrijus!

[20:04] <autrijus> fglock: interestingly, _all_ your commits are in PIL-Run as covered yesterday, so I didn't mention you in today's journal. but your work took the most time by far for me to catch up with :)

[20:05] <fglock> I was too behind - I had to run to catch up with the team

[20:06] <autrijus> it's really very delightful to see the p6-on-p5 inflection point approaching within sight.

[20:06] <svnbot6> r6644 | fglock++ | * PIL-Run - uc,ucfirst,lc,lcfirst

[20:07] <autrijus> happy hacking. :) really &

[20:07] <fglock> good night!

[20:09] <ods15> '$links{readlink}' what does this do

[20:09] <ods15> does it refernce 'readlink' or does it call the function..

[20:09] <ods15> in perl5

[20:10] <gaal> in perl5 that's a hash lookup with the string "readlink" as key.

[20:12] <wolverian> +readlink or readlink() would call the function

[20:12] <ods15> ya

[20:13] <wolverian> I wonder if I can use celestia as the screen saver..

[20:14] <wolverian> well, time to sleep. good night everyone!

[20:15] <ods15> nasty

[20:15] <ods15> delete @links{grep { -l } bsd_glob('/home/ods15/mdf/noise Folder/*')};

[20:15] <ods15> i love perl

[20:17] <PerlJam> "bsd_glob"?  isn't that just "glob"?

[20:19] <ods15> no because of the space

[20:43] <svnbot6> r6645 | kolibrie++ | changed <$fh> to =$fh

[20:43] <svnbot6> r6646 | fglock++ | * perl5/Code - new methods Code::signature_str and Perl6::Param::str

[20:43] <svnbot6> r6646 | fglock++ |   - the signature can be stringified, for use in error messages

[21:01] <svnbot6> r6647 | fglock++ | * perl5/ Code - new Class 'Perl6::Type'

[21:01] <svnbot6> r6647 | fglock++ |   - signature stringification includes the subtype

[21:13] <svnbot6> r6648 | fglock++ | * perl5/Code - subroutines now stringify like 'sub (Any $name) {...}'

[21:16] <landover> where can i find pugs for winblows?

[21:17] <geoffb> At least at one point there was a 'PxPerl' that included Pugs and Parrot, precompiled for Win32 . . . but I'm not sure what happened to it

[21:56] <landover> hrmith

[21:56] <landover> geoffb - well it would be nice if i could run perl6 like i can python heh

[23:25] <brentdax> I thought you guys cleared up the intermittent can't-find-a-method problem?

[23:27] <brentdax> ...whoa, what the heck is this?

[23:37] <brentdax> There's something wrong with hashes--the pairs in the hash are getting paired up again somehow, and the "key" pairs are getting stringified.

[23:56] <luqui> brentdax, can you example it?

[23:57] <brentdax> It seems to happen when a hash passes through a function call.  If you backslash the hash, the problem seems to go away.

[23:57] <brentdax> I need to get this released, but I'll work on it in a little while.

[23:57] <luqui> okay, thanks
