[02:17] <kungfuftr> yay!

[02:47] <kungfuftr> bah, where's nothingmuch when ye want him

[04:21] <crysflame> 08:47 -!- nothingmuch [~nothingmu@212.143.92.226] has quit []

[04:21] <crysflame> 21:22 now

[05:24] <autrijus> hi.

[05:24] <autrijus> wolverian: Array.isa("List").

[05:25] <autrijus> $a = <x y>; $a.ref; # this should be "Array".

[05:25] <autrijus> so that's a bug.

[05:25] <autrijus> Array is a mutable IType; List is an immutable IType, that's all

[05:25] <autrijus> Hash is also mutable; Array and Hash represents different mutable views on List.

[05:25] <autrijus> so they both .isa lis

[05:25] <autrijus> list

[05:26] <wolverian> right. thanks.

[05:26] <autrijus> since that's a bug... please add a test :D

[05:26] <wolverian> sure. by the way, is <a b c>.kv failing a todo or not?

[05:26] <wolverian> I'm unclear on the todoity of things.

[05:27] <autrijus> wolverian: <a b c> is a List not an Array

[05:27] <autrijus> so according to Rod's draft of s29 it shall fail.

[05:27] <wolverian> lists don't have .kv? hm.

[05:27] <autrijus> # http://www.rodadams.net/Perl/S29.html#perl6::lists

[05:27] <wolverian> right. that makes sense, if Hash.isa(List)

[05:27] <autrijus> I see no .kv there.

[05:28] <autrijus> if you'd like to have it... tell Rod

[05:28] <wolverian> it'd be logical, since a list can be indexed similarly like an array

[05:29] <autrijus> maybe. in my mind though, list isn't keyed

[05:29] <autrijus> although you can certainly write <a b c>[0]

[05:29] <wolverian> that's what I'm basing my feeling on.

[05:29] <autrijus> you can also write

[05:29] <autrijus> <a b c d>{'a'}

[05:30] <wolverian> hmm. 

[05:30] <autrijus> and neither is really keyed to the list

[05:30] <autrijus> it's just dynamic polymorphic interface

[05:30] <wolverian> in that case, .kv makes no sense.

[05:30] <wolverian> I'll remove the todo. :)

[05:30] <wolverian> I mean, the test.

[05:30] <autrijus> =)

[05:30] <wolverian> where should the .isa tests go?

[05:32] <autrijus> I have no idea. improvise :)

[05:32] <autrijus> I need to run now to $wr0k

[05:32] <wolverian> will do!

[05:32] <autrijus> see you in a bit

[05:32] <wolverian> have fun.

[05:33] <wolverian> t/builtins/list/* look like array tests :)

[05:33] <autrijus> refactor mercilessly then. :)

[05:33] * autrijus waves &

[05:47] <mj> $a = <x y>; $a.ref; # this should be "Array". 

[05:47] <mj> but <a b c> is a List not an Array, right?

[05:48] <wolverian> I don't know. autrijus, help? :)

[05:50] <mj> autrijus said that, IMO, I have to study :-) before push @larry, $mj.

[05:52] <wolverian> svn is giving me hard time. oh well, have to learn this sometime.

[06:25] <gaal> wolverian, still there?

[06:25] <wolverian> yes.

[06:25] <gaal> there's an accidental test for the List tihng in undef.t already

[06:26] <gaal> (if's failing, of course)

[06:26] <wolverian> argh.

[06:26] <gaal> no no, it's okay

[06:26] <gaal> it's all right if we happen to have duplicate tests

[06:26] <wolverian> right. didn't think to look there :)

[06:26] <gaal> in undef.t it's just a sanity check of some scaffolding before the "real" test

[06:28] <gaal> my gut feeling is that <a b>.ref should be List, but i mat be wrong!

[06:28] <gaal> hey nm

[06:28] <gaal> brb, need coffee

[06:28] <wolverian> yes, it should be. :)

[06:28] <nothingmuch> beh

[06:28] <nothingmuch> these antihistamines are really fucking me up

[06:28] <wolverian> my computer has suddenly decided to get cranky. X doesn't want to use DRI and my sound doesn't work :()

[06:29] <wolverian> s,),, # argh.

[06:29] <nothingmuch> ugg

[06:29] <nothingmuch> not good news

[06:29] <nothingmuch> i hate fixing DRI

[06:29] <wolverian> it worked on the last reboot..

[06:29] <nothingmuch> in fact, i hate fixing it so much that i only ever finished doing it once

[06:29] <nothingmuch> cvs-dri on mach-64 ati card

[06:29] <wolverian> and this is ubuntu, I haven't had to touch any X related configuration file at all

[06:29] <nothingmuch> 3 years ago

[06:29] <wolverian> and it just worked! but now it suddenly stopped working. bleh.

[06:30] <nothingmuch> ubuntu sounds funky

[06:30] <wolverian> it is nice.

[06:30] * nothingmuch thinks it might be good for workplace

[06:30] <nothingmuch> people will need a few linux workstations

[06:35] <wolverian> hmm. so. sub foo (Array $foo) { ... } foo <a b c>; # works?

[06:35] <wolverian> I could try.

[06:36] <wolverian> doesn't.

[06:39] *** castaway_ is now known as castaway

[06:40] <castaway> mornin

[06:42] <nothingmuch> morning castaway 

[06:42] <castaway> hey.. 

[06:42] <castaway> did I kill SEE? :)

[06:43] <wolverian> relogging to x fixed DRI and sound. hmph.

[06:48] <nothingmuch> castaway:  maybe, i dunno

[06:49] <castaway> It's not there anymore, anyhoo

[06:49] <nothingmuch> i'll try to open it

[06:49] <nothingmuch> beh

[06:49] <nothingmuch> someone rebooted

[06:49] <nothingmuch> no windowserver session

[06:50] <nothingmuch> sowwy

[06:50] <castaway> O

[06:50] <castaway> Ok

[07:01] <hoowa> why pugs doesn't support .last method?

[07:23] <rindolf> nothingmuch: ahoy there, matey!

[07:24] <nothingmuch> ahoy

[07:24] <nothingmuch> how may i be of assistance dear sire?

[07:39] <wolverian> hrm. does perl6 have instance method references? 

[07:49] <theorbtwo> wolverian: Doesn't need something specific for them.

[07:49] <theorbtwo> They're just a specific case of .assuming.

[07:51] <wolverian> hmm, good point. that's a tad longer to type, though. :)

[07:51] <masak> what's the syntax for changing an array in pugs?

[07:51] <masak> i'm trying to do this (perl 5 code):

[07:51] <masak> $a = [(1,2,3),(4,5,0)];

[07:51] <masak> $a->[1][-1] = 6;

[07:51] <masak> but it doesn't work

[07:52] <nothingmuch> that's not p5, methinks

[07:52] <masak> hm

[07:52] <masak> maybe i should try it in p5 first

[07:52] <wolverian> my pugs still doesn't like nested structures.

[07:52] <masak> it doesn't?

[07:52] <nothingmuch> it will make @$a = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0);

[07:53] <nothingmuch> which is not what you meant, i think

[07:53] <masak> not what i meant

[07:53] <masak> i want to use nesting

[07:53] <nothingmuch> try using a greater list comma:

[07:53] <nothingmuch> $a = [ 1, 2, 3 ; 4, 5, 0 ];

[07:53] <masak> ah, of coruse

[07:53] <masak> thx

[07:54] <nothingmuch> i don't know if it will work

[07:54] <wolverian> it doesn't here.

[07:54] <masak> not here either

[07:55] <nothingmuch> ok

[07:55] <masak> i'm trying to write tic-tac-toe

[07:55] <masak> i could do it without nesting

[07:55] <nothingmuch> so try $a [ [ 1 .. 3 ], [ 1, 2, 0 ] ]

[07:55] <masak> ok

[07:55] <nothingmuch> tic tac toe would be wonderful bound

[07:56] <nothingmuch> $diag[0] := $matrix[0][0]

[07:56] <nothingmuch> $diag[1] := $matrix[1][1]

[07:56] <nothingmuch> $diag[2] := $matrix[2][2];

[07:56] <nothingmuch> then you just iterate @diags, @rows, @columns

[07:56] <nothingmuch> and then see if they are all the same

[07:56] <wolverian> iterate $diag, you mean :)

[07:56] <nothingmuch> no,@diags is ($diag1, $diag2)

[07:57] <wolverian> sure! 

[07:57] <nothingmuch> if @diag[0] >>eq<< 'x'

[07:57] <wolverian> been up all night, so I think it's time to sleep. it's only 11am.

[07:57] <masak> i'm trying to modify the matrix by

[07:57] <masak> $matrix[1][1] = 3

[07:57] <masak> but it says

[07:57] <masak> "Can't modify constant item"

[07:58] <nothingmuch> that's odd

[07:58] <nothingmuch> we ought to tell autrijus 

[07:58] <nothingmuch> it sounds more like binding complexity and context issues than subscripting or multidim

[07:58] <masak> always when i test things i turn up oddness :)

[07:59] <nothingmuch> that means you're a good tester, masak 

[07:59] <masak> you'd better keep me away from testing the vital parts of the code :)

[07:59] <nothingmuch> btw, can you commit a test for that case?

[07:59] <masak> ok

[07:59] <nothingmuch> why?

[07:59] <nothingmuch> we want the bugs to shine =)

[07:59] <masak> it's more like i cause bugs by finding them. quantum physics :)

[08:00] <nothingmuch> heh

[08:00] <masak> i would be a good tester if i were actively looking for bugs

[08:00] <masak> right now i'm only trying to write a game

[08:01] <ingy> hola

[08:01] <masak> hi ingy

[08:01] <nothingmuch> hola ingy 

[08:01] <nothingmuch> i need releng advice

[08:01] <nothingmuch> testgraph.css, template.html

[08:01] <nothingmuch> where should they go?

[08:01] <ingy> I am reading about doxygen and getting good ideas for Perldoc

[08:01] <nothingmuch> doxygen is rather nice

[08:02] <ingy> CRAZY IDEAS!!

[08:02] <nothingmuch> but smart comments are not %POD savvy

[08:02] <ingy> sorry

[08:02] <ingy> nothingmuch: they could be

[08:02] <nothingmuch> then they should be =pod foo

[08:02] <nothingmuch> not comments

[08:02] <ingy> that's why I'm meeting  with Larry in  Toronto :)

[08:03] <nothingmuch> which raises the issue for doc on the tail of a line again

[08:03] <masak> this should work, right?

[08:03] <masak> -bash-3.00$ pugs -e 'my $a = [[2]]; $a[0][0] = 6; say $a'

[08:03] <masak> Can't modify constant item

[08:03] <masak> Val VUndef

[08:07] <ingy> damn i think today was one of the best days of my life

[08:07] <masak> why?

[08:07] <ingy> it was just a good one

[08:07] <masak> :)

[08:08] <nothingmuch> details!

[08:08] <ingy> a lot of cool things happened

[08:08] <nothingmuch> masak: in theory

[08:08] <nothingmuch> masak: commit a test =)

[08:08] <masak> ingy: you should have best days of your life more often, i recommend it

[08:08] <masak> nothingmuch: ok

[08:08] <ingy> masak: I recommend it too

[08:09] <nothingmuch> i think it's not copying 2, since it's not directly assigned

[08:10] <rindolf> nothingmuch: what do you think of http://better-scm.berlios.de/ ?

[08:10] <ingy> nothingmuch: what do you think about comments that get preprocessed into regular pod (but with smarts based on position etc) just be before compilation?

[08:10] <nothingmuch> where's darcs?

[08:10] <rindolf> ingy: hi there.

[08:10] <ingy> hi schlomi

[08:10] <nothingmuch> ingy: i think comments should be accessible either way

[08:10] <rindolf> ingy: it's "Shlomi" (without a C)

[08:11] <nothingmuch> you don't want to know what Devel::FIXME does

[08:11] <ingy> ah

[08:11] <nothingmuch> but i'll tell you anyway

[08:11] <ingy> ha

[08:11] <nothingmuch> it puts a subref in @INC

[08:11] <nothingmuch> sets a local lock

[08:11] <nothingmuch> calls require again

[08:11] <ingy> cool

[08:11] <nothingmuch> this time the hook fails since the lock is in effect

[08:11] <ingy> yep

[08:11] <nothingmuch> the "normal" @INC finds the module

[08:11] <nothingmuch> and then you go back to the callback

[08:12] <nothingmuch> where you can find it's file in %INC

[08:12] <nothingmuch> so it opens that, and looks for comments with a regex

[08:12] <nothingmuch> which is really silly, since it could all just be done with a well defined hook for "new module was required"

[08:12] <nothingmuch> and the comment data tree exposed

[08:12] <nothingmuch> parsing perl with a regex is stupid

[08:13] <nothingmuch> i could have done it with source filters, or at least Filter::Simple's regex

[08:13] <nothingmuch> but it just seemed like too much work, and getting a fake FIXME from a string that contains "# FIXME foo" is not that bAD

[08:13] <ingy> :)

[08:14] <masak> i have a problem with my test, it aborts on the nested change attempt $a[0][0] = 6;

[08:14] <nothingmuch> rindolf: why isn't darcs listed?

[08:14] <nothingmuch> because arch is typically tla

[08:14] <masak> and i even put it in an eval {}

[08:14] <nothingmuch> or bazaar/arx? or maybe they're under arch?

[08:14] <nothingmuch> masak: not eval {}

[08:14] <masak> ok

[08:14] <rindolf> nothingmuch: because it wasn't added yet. I have to add it.

[08:14] <rindolf> nothingmuch: bazaar/bazaar-ng and arx fall under the Arch category.

[08:14] <nothingmuch> my $a = [[2]]; eval_is('$a[0][0] = 6; $a[0][0]', 6);

[08:15] <ingy> I lost 15 lbs in 8 days

[08:15] <nothingmuch> i don'y see tla under there

[08:15] <nothingmuch> oh my

[08:15] <nothingmuch> do you have cancer or something?

[08:15] <ingy> I just need to lose 15 more

[08:15] <masak> nothingmuch: thx

[08:15] <nothingmuch> where would you put svk?

[08:15] <ingy> only 8 more days!

[08:15] <rindolf> Why does everyone and his mother start their own VCS project?

[08:15] <nothingmuch> why are you trying to lose 30 pounds in 16 days?

[08:15] <rindolf> nothingmuch: it's in the comparison for time being.

[08:16] <nothingmuch> rindolf: darwinism is one of the side effects of opensourcce

[08:16] <ingy> because I want to to weigh under 190

[08:16] <nothingmuch> how much is 190?

[08:16] <ingy> 94 or so?

[08:16] <rindolf> perlbot: 190 lbs = kg?

[08:16] <rindolf> perlbot: 190 lbs

[08:16] <nothingmuch> hah

[08:17] <nothingmuch> perlbot know too much

[08:17] <ingy> perlbot: change 190 lbs to kg

[08:17] <rindolf> Barbaric Americans. Pounds...

[08:17] <rindolf> perlbot: convert 190 lbs to kg

[08:17] <nothingmuch> rindolf: i also think that the front page should have:

[08:17] * ingy pounds rindolf into submission

[08:17] <nothingmuch> FREE (speech|beer|NA)

[08:18] <nothingmuch> distributed/centralized

[08:18] <nothingmuch> those are the top level distinctions i make

[08:18] <rindolf> nothingmuch: where should it have it?

[08:18] <ingy> 2.2 lbs = 1 kg I think

[08:18] <nothingmuch> right under the name, maybe

[08:18] <ingy> perlbot: 190 / 2.2

[08:18] <rindolf> 1lb = 0.46 kg or so.

[08:18] <rindolf> perlbot: math 190 / 2.2

[08:18] <perlbot> 86.3636363636364

[08:19] <pjcj> nothingmuch: did you try using CORE::GLOBAL::require ?

[08:19] <masak> perlbot++

[08:19] <nothingmuch> btw, if you're listing bitkeeper, why not p4 and vss? p4 is free (Beer) for a two user, two machine license for opensource devel, i think

[08:19] <nothingmuch> pjcj: yes, it looked easier to implement a hook in @INC than to reimplement require

[08:19] <nothingmuch> because it is sort of weird

[08:19] <nothingmuch> accepting barewords and such

[08:19] <rindolf> nothingmuch: I'm not listing VSS because it's even lamer than CVS.

[08:19] <nothingmuch> rindolf: so? people should know to be weary of it

[08:19] <rindolf> nothingmuch: As for perforce, maybe I should add it.

[08:19] <ingy> I should patent my new diet

[08:20] <rindolf> nothingmuch: I'm not listing CVS either.

[08:20] <nothingmuch> ingy: what's your new diet?

[08:20] <nothingmuch> rindolf: but the page says "cvs is bad use this:"

[08:20] <wolverian> svk! darcs! bazaar! bazaar-ng! 

[08:20] <ingy> nothingmuch takes the bait

[08:20] <ingy> well...

[08:20] <ingy> you go to Taiwan

[08:20] <ingy> come home

[08:20] <nothingmuch> i'm just suggesting "cvs is bad, use this, but don't use this, it's as bad as cvs"

[08:20] <ingy> $gf dumps you

[08:20] <nothingmuch> do you get really fat in Taiwan?

[08:20] <nothingmuch> from all that beer?

[08:21] <nothingmuch> ah, the last step is taken care of

[08:21] <ingy> no I lost a pound maybe in Taiwan

[08:21] <nothingmuch> quite some time ago

[08:21] <ingy> then you sleep a lot and don't eat

[08:21] * nothingmuch can't sleep too much

[08:21] <ingy> and then you start losing weight

[08:21] <ingy> and you say cool!

[08:21] <masak> ingy: $gf dump you because you lost a pound in taiwan?

[08:21] <nothingmuch> makes me depressed, but furthermore, it makes me feel really bad

[08:22] <ingy> and then you eat like a bowl of rice a day

[08:22] <nothingmuch> rindolf: also, most VCSs should, IMHO have their major strong points and bad points listed

[08:22] <ingy> masak: no $gf dumped me because she's an idiot

[08:22] <ingy> (of course)

[08:22] <rindolf> nothingmuch: possibly. Have you looked at the comparison yet?

[08:22] <nothingmuch> arch: capable, complete, GPLed, tla is complicated, arx, bazaar are new

[08:22] <nothingmuch> i have

[08:23] <masak> ingy: of course

[08:23] <nothingmuch> monotone: capable, new, crypgraphic, doesn't use gpg for crypto, slow

[08:23] <rindolf> A page with a VCS systems to avoid would actually be a good idea.

[08:23] <ingy> but after a couple days I just want to go up to $gf and get down on my knees and...

[08:23] <rindolf> nothingmuch: and weird hash values as versions.

[08:24] <ingy> thank her passionately for leaving!

[08:24] <nothingmuch> well, i don't really know monotone, so i can't say more

[08:24] <rindolf> ingy: :-)

[08:24] <nothingmuch> ingy: so why are you sleeping a lot?

[08:24] <ingy> life is like 100 times better

[08:24] <ingy> nothingmuch: because when you barely eat you need more sleep

[08:25] <nothingmuch> ah, i thought it was the other way around

[08:25] <masak> ingy++

[08:25] <nothingmuch> when you sleep too much, you barely eat

[08:25] <masak> i fasted for nine days a couple of months ago

[08:25] <ingy> yeah that too

[08:25] <masak> it was nice

[08:25] <ingy> masak++

[08:25] <nothingmuch> the antihistamines are having that effect on me, now

[08:25] <ingy> yeah, it's totally doable

[08:25] <nothingmuch> sleep too much

[08:25] <nothingmuch> so i eat about 40%

[08:25] <nothingmuch> less

[08:26] <nothingmuch> but then again, i don't burn all that food either

[08:26] <ingy> also mugwump told me i was fat in Taiwan

[08:26] <ingy> which is about the only hing he said to me  that really made sense

[08:26] <nothingmuch> heh

[08:26] <mj> 21/4310 subtests failed, 99.51% okay.

[08:27] <masak> i've committed a test, how long before the perlbot thingy announces it?

[08:27] <ingy> tommorrow I have a bike race though

[08:27] <ingy> I will likely need to eat a little more

[08:27] <rindolf> ingy: motorbike, or bicycle?

[08:27] <masak> ingy: sounds like a good idea

[08:27] <ingy> bicycle

[08:27] <mj> r1953 -  973/4310 subtests failed, 77.42% okay.

[08:27] <rindolf> ingy: ah good. /me likes biking.

[08:28] <ingy> I'm the fattest guy in the peleton

[08:28] <ingy> once i get below 190 I'll be flying though

[08:28] <mj> i hate new miranda irc :-(

[08:28] <ingy> 190 is about my optimal race weight

[08:29] <rindolf> ingy: I never pictured you as a fat guy.

[08:29] <masak> ingy: i think i'll try your rice/no $gf diet

[08:29] <nothingmuch> aren't you losing a crapload of muscle tissue with this amazing new diet?

[08:29] <mj> s/todo_//   ... r1953 -  973/4310 subtests failed, 77.42% okay.

[08:29] <ingy> masak: the secret is to pretend you are depressed

[08:29] <masak> ingy: how?

[08:29] <ingy> after you start losing weight

[08:29] <ingy> you'll feel good

[08:29] <masak> i'm so happy

[08:29] <ingy> about yourself

[08:30] <ingy> so then you have to fake it

[08:30] <nothingmuch> mj: todo_ how much is t/oo?

[08:30] <ingy> that it really sucks that you got dumped

[08:30] <masak> ingy: hm. sounds dangerous

[08:30] <masak> what if you start to believe it?

[08:31] <ingy> I get on the scale about 25 times a day

[08:31] <ingy> masak: well I have a goal weight

[08:31] <ingy> Going for 160 would be dangerous

[08:31] <nothingmuch> ingy++; # amusing

[08:32] <masak> ingy: so after you reach your goal weight you'll stop simulating depression?

[08:32] * castaway doesnt think pretending that is such a useful idea

[08:32] <ingy> anyway I'm hungry, better catch some zzzzzzzzz

[08:32] <nothingmuch> hah

[08:32] <rindolf> castaway++

[08:32] <rindolf> perlbot: karma castaway 

[08:32] <perlbot> Karma for castaway: 5

[08:32] <jabbot> rindolf: castaway  has neutral karma

[08:32] <masak> ingy: i want to eat rice but i don't want to sacrifice happiness

[08:32] <rindolf> jabbot: I didn't ask you.

[08:32] <jabbot> rindolf: Oh, I?

[08:33] <castaway> Just eat what you want to eat, and be who you are :)

[08:33] <ingy> but masak I just had the best day of my life

[08:33] <ingy> it's not all that bad ;)

[08:33] <nothingmuch> ... fat, and ugly, and unattractive! yah! /me can vouch for that

[08:33] <rindolf> ingy: eat according to the stomach and not according to the eyes.

[08:33] <ingy> nightnight all

[08:33] <castaway> night ingy

[08:33] <masak> ingy:  the best depressed day of your life? :)

[08:33] <nothingmuch> i'm happy, /and/ chubby

[08:33] <rindolf> ingy: bye

[08:33] <masak> night ingy

[08:33] <rindolf> nothingmuch: you're not fat.

[08:34] <nothingmuch> rindolf: not fat, like obese

[08:34] <nothingmuch> but the mass that I do have is not very healthy mass

[08:34] <mj> http://wiki.kn.vutbr.cz/mj/index.cgi?Pugs%20on%20MS%20Windows%20-%20tests and links

[08:34] * nothingmuch has no money to buy the bike he wants

[08:34] <masak> how long before the bot thingy announces my patch? how does it work? do i have to do something?

[08:34] <nothingmuch> but that shall be rectified in due time

[08:34] <rindolf> nothingmuch: don't you have two jobs?

[08:34] <nothingmuch> one, now

[08:34] <nothingmuch> but i just bought a double bass

[08:34] <castaway> it does it by itself, when it notices

[08:34] <nothingmuch> and before that i bought a camera

[08:34] <rindolf> nothingmuch: I see.

[08:34] <nothingmuch> and before that a laptop

[08:35] <nothingmuch> and a computer

[08:35] <rindolf> nothingmuch: and an iPod.

[08:35] <nothingmuch> and ....

[08:35] * castaway hugs nothingmuch 

[08:35] <nothingmuch> an ipod was way before

[08:35] <nothingmuch> i painted a house for that

[08:35] <rindolf> nothingmuch: do you have a savings account?

[08:35] <rindolf> Or an insurance?

[08:35] <nothingmuch> savings account was dipped into, to cover the bass

[08:35] <nothingmuch> and what would insurance help me?

[08:36] <rindolf> nothingmuch: no, I meant, in case something bad happens to you.

[08:36] <rindolf> So you won't spend all your money on accessories.

[08:36] <nothingmuch> what should i insure?

[08:37] <nothingmuch> the bass should be insured, as soon as the forms are faxed over

[08:37] <rindolf> nothingmuch: is it a bass guitar?

[08:37] <castaway> (savings, what are those?)

[08:37] <nothingmuch> rindolf: bass guitars aren't that expensive

[08:38] * rindolf is listening to Frankie Goes to Hollywood - Relax

[08:38] <nothingmuch> http://xrl.us/frxn <-- double bass

[08:38] <rindolf> nothingmuch: oh you mean a contra-bass. One of those huge violins.

[08:39] <nothingmuch> it's not in the violin family, it's a viol (traditionally)

[08:39] <nothingmuch> and it's called contra bass in german and hebrew

[08:39] <nothingmuch> but upright bass or double bass in english

[08:39] <nothingmuch> but yes, that's what i mean =)

[08:39] <rindolf> nothingmuch: why do you need such an instrument for?

[08:39] <nothingmuch> i don't know, it's just pretty

[08:39] <nothingmuch> you, like to keep in your room

[08:40] <nothingmuch> it takes up about 20% of the volume

[08:40] <nothingmuch> but i can live with that

[08:40] <rindolf> nothingmuch: you don't play it?

[08:40] <nothingmuch> ofcourse i do, don't be silly

[08:40] <rindolf> Heh.

[08:40] <boogie> hi to all! is it possible to make a wish related to pugs here? :)

[08:40] <nothingmuch> boogie: ofcourse

[08:41] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: yullo!

[08:41] <masak> "roses are flowers

[08:41] <masak> viols are bass

[08:41] <masak> what is it good for?

[08:41] <masak> put it in your ear"

[08:41] <nothingmuch> hola kungfuftr 

[08:41] <nothingmuch> masak: seek help =)

[08:41] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: i have a new template and css file for you

[08:41] <masak> :)

[08:41] <boogie> i'm interested in pugs on the web, and "read" support is needed fo it. ;)

[08:41] <nothingmuch> darcs send, kungfuftr )

[08:41] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: no darcs here

[08:41] <nothingmuch> s/\)$/=)/

[08:41] <nothingmuch> aaah! no darcs!

[08:42] <nothingmuch> ok, so send a unidiff,

[08:42] <nothingmuch> or nopaste it somewhere

[08:42] <nothingmuch> or, i dunno

[08:42] <kungfuftr> http://kungfuftr.com/template-tg.html and http://kungfuftr.com/tg.css

[08:42] <kungfuftr> (i have a slightly newer version, but that's at home

[08:42] <nothingmuch> ok

[08:42] <nothingmuch> what does it do differently?

[08:43] <nothingmuch> xhtml 1.1?

[08:43] <nothingmuch> i see funny tags

[08:44] <nothingmuch> and I see css saying display: table-cell, etc

[08:44] <nothingmuch> but i can't say if that's the whole difference

[08:44] <nothingmuch> (btw, how backwards compatible is this?)

[08:44] <kungfuftr> not hugely, tbh

[08:45] <kungfuftr> anything that's CSS2 and xhtml will support it

[08:45] <nothingmuch> ok

[08:45] <nothingmuch> i'll apply it soon

[08:45] <kungfuftr> nice thing is that it gives the ability not only to view it, but to parse it as XML too

[08:45] <nothingmuch> yeah

[08:45] <nothingmuch> although if you're sane you just usse Test::TAP::Model =)

[08:46] <kungfuftr> yar, need to change the code to not use classnames as selectors at some point too

[08:46] <boogie> nothingmuch: so is there somebody who could implement "read"? :))

[08:47] <nothingmuch> like read($fh)?

[08:47] <nothingmuch> with byte counts?

[08:47] <boogie> yes, read($fh, $string, $length);

[08:48] <nothingmuch> i can try

[08:48] <nothingmuch> but in about 30 minutes

[08:48] * nothingmuch has to do some C++ hacking

[08:48] <nothingmuch> =(

[08:48] <boogie> personally, I would do it on a socket, but on normal STDIN would be usefull, too.

[08:48] <boogie> thanks a lot!

[08:57] <mj> my $b = [ <a b> ];

[08:57] <mj> say $b[0].ref ~ $b[1].ref ~ $b[2].ref;

[09:02] <mj> and

[09:17] <mj> my $b = [ { 1 }, { 2 } ]; say $b().ref; # pugs: cannot cast from VList [VCode...

[09:32] <autrijus> brb...

[09:33] <mj> mj := rootmj; # committer bit found

[09:33] <mj> time to go home, maybe tomorrow

[09:34] <masak> hi autrijus

[09:37] <masak> i found a deep array modification bug when trying to write tic-tac-toe

[09:38] <masak> -bash-3.00$ pugs -e 'my $a = [[2]]; $a[0][0] = 6; say $a'

[09:38] <masak> Can't modify constant item

[09:38] <masak> Val VUndef

[09:55] <kungfuftr> masak: looks possibly like an auto-quoting bug (ie: is trying to subscript instead of assigning value '2')

[09:59] <masak> kungfuftr: i don't understand but i don't think it matters... i'm only a tester :)

[09:59] * masak has to learn haskell soon

[10:08] <nothingmuch> autrijus: ping

[10:13] <tiw> hi nothingmuch

[10:13] <nothingmuch> hola

[10:13] <nothingmuch> que tiw?

[10:13] <tiw> is dereference implemented?

[10:13] <nothingmuch> i have no clue

[10:13] <nothingmuch> i'm out of date

[10:14] <tiw> aha, me too

[10:20] * nothingmuch goes to drive dad

[10:23] *** b6s_ is now known as b6s

[12:24] <machack666> is this expected behavior: pugs -e 'say (3).ref' --> Int

[12:24] <machack666> pugs -e 'say 3.ref' --> parse error (unexpected 'r')

[12:35] <stevan> boogie: what are you looking to do?

[12:36] <stevan> boogie: have you seen the CGI and LWP::Simple in Pugs already?

[12:36] <stevan> nothingmuch: ping

[12:38] <stevan> pugs -e 'say ref(undef())' # Scalar

[12:38] <stevan> I think that makes sense :)

[12:39] <boogie> stevan: I would like to "hack" a web server.

[12:39] <boogie> stevan: just a small for playing around

[12:40] <stevan> boogie: I was thinking of doing that too :)

[12:40] <stevan> boogie: have you see examples/network ?

[12:40] <boogie> stevan: Yes, on the perl-compiler mailing list as "Andras Barthazi" I had some mail

[12:41] <stevan> boogie: ahhh, welcome :)

[12:41] <stevan> boogie: did you get the commiter invite yet? I just sent it to you

[12:42] <boogie> Yes, I've started reading it now. :)

[12:44] <nothingmuch> pong

[12:57] <cognominal> in haskell, one can use a function name as an operator, say:  x 'mod' 2

[12:57] <cognominal> Is there anything like this in Perl6?

[12:59] <stevan> &infix:<my-op>

[12:59] <stevan> or something like that (i think)

[13:05] <cognominal> thx:  that means that one don't even needs the quotes unlike haskell

[13:09] <autrijus> x `mod` 2

[13:09] <autrijus> and yes:

[13:09] <autrijus> &infix:<mod> ::= &mod;

[13:10] <autrijus> or if you are feeling haskellish

[13:10] <autrijus> &infix:<`mod`> ::= &mod;

[13:11] <autrijus> hrm. does :x-on-by-default applies to :perl5 also?

[13:12] <autrijus> I'll assume so

[13:14] <stevan> autrijus: I would think so

[13:14] <masak> stevan: there's a comitter invite? what is it?

[13:14] <autrijus> cool. expect full flags coming

[13:14] <stevan> masak: are you a committer?

[13:14] <masak> yes

[13:14] <stevan> autrijus++

[13:15] <stevan> the invite is just the mail sent from OSSF

[13:15] <masak> ah, ok

[13:16] <masak> i seem to remember it vaguely... parts of it were in korean :)

[13:16] <stevan> chinese :)

[13:17] <masak> right :) i still haven't managed to conf fedora core 3 to show any of those correctly :(

[13:18] * masak wants chinese characters

[13:18] <stevan> masak: thats why I like OSX ,.. it all works out of the box

[13:18] <masak> osx++

[13:18] * stevan has several asian fonts installed,.. but can read none of them

[13:19] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: you like?

[13:21] <stevan> has anyone told perl-qa about Test::TAP::Model?

[13:21] <kungfuftr> don't think so, have a feeling it's not quite ready just yet

[13:22] <stevan> kungfuftr: I disagree,.. the official module is not ready, but the Pugs version is up and working

[13:22] <stevan> we could show them that

[13:22] <kungfuftr> up and working?

[13:22] <autrijus> sanity-check:

[13:22] <stevan> the smoke tests you run

[13:22] <autrijus>             { rxRegex  = mkRegexWithPCRE (encodeUTF8 str) $

[13:22] <autrijus>                 [ flag_i `implies` pcreCaseless

[13:22] <autrijus>                 , pcreExtended      -- Always assume /x

[13:22] <autrijus>                 , pcreDotall        -- . matchs \n

[13:22] <autrijus>                 , pcreDollarEndonly -- $ does not match \n$

[13:22] <autrijus>                 ]

[13:22] <autrijus> i.e. even if you write :p5

[13:22] <kungfuftr> stevan: current smoke stuff i'm running is what's in util/

[13:22] <autrijus> it adds  //sx for you

[13:23] <autrijus> and cause $ to not match the eol \n

[13:23] <autrijus> thus agreeing with p6 default behaviour

[13:23] <stevan> kungfuftr: yeah that stuff

[13:23] <autrijus> sane? (you can always turn it on/off inside the rx)

[13:23] <stevan> autrijus: I am not a p5 rexexp guru, and I like the p6 ones better, so I am not a good judge

[13:23] <kungfuftr> stevan: that stuff isn't Test-TAP-Model, it's it's predecessor

[13:23] <stevan> but yes I think its sane :)

[13:23] <autrijus> :D

[13:24] <autrijus> ok. I'll do that and if people are hurt, they'll yell

[13:24] <stevan> autrijus: but many people (including my family) question *my* sanity , so I am not a good judge of that either

[13:24] <autrijus> another option is to suddenly allow perl5 modifiers after :p5

[13:24] <autrijus> i.e.

[13:24] <autrijus> :p5:s:m///

[13:24] <stevan> kungfuftr: I am just thinking that we can say "test::TAP::*" is on the way,.. and here is the early version

[13:25] <stevan> autrijus: are you shortening it to :p5:?

[13:25] <autrijus> that may create another insanity mess though, so I tend not to go there

[13:25] <autrijus> stevan: e05 says both :p5 and :perl5

[13:25] <autrijus> but s05 does not mention :perl5

[13:25] <stevan> autrijus: p5: is much nicer

[13:25] <autrijus> I think I'll allow both.

[13:25] <stevan> sounds good to me

[13:25] <kungfuftr> stevan: i'd wait, tbh... tighten it down a little

[13:25] <stevan> kungfuftr: ok with me

[13:25] <autrijus> strangely we almost always agree.

[13:26] <stevan> autrijus: scary isnt it

[13:26] <stevan> perl 6 makes so much more sense to me

[13:26] <stevan> I love perl(5), but before this project started I was feeling the Ruby/Python/Java pull

[13:27] <autrijus> indeed.

[13:27] <stevan> craving multi-subs/methods, type, etc

[13:27] <kungfuftr> new template stuff++ # it's XML, but yet you can view it directly in firefox/<sane browsers>

[13:27] <autrijus> and I guess CPAN was keeping you afloat as well

[13:27] * stevan likes XML actually

[13:27] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: you going to be around at 7pm BST?

[13:27] * autrijus likes XML with XML::Twig only

[13:28] <stevan> autrijus: that and the 13K of perl5 code which keeps our company afloat :)

[13:28] <nothingmuch> BST? what's that?

[13:28] <stevan> XML::SAX++

[13:28] <autrijus> 13kloc is not terribly large :)

[13:28] <kungfuftr> british standard time, 1 hour ahead of GMT

[13:28] <nothingmuch> i'm leaving for my bass lesson in about an hour and a half

[13:28] <autrijus> I imagine porting it to p6 will be ~2wk of work

[13:28] <nothingmuch> then i am going to a friend

[13:28] <stevan> autrijus: exactly :)

[13:28] <nothingmuch> should be back by midnight

[13:28] <nothingmuch> which is 22 gmt

[13:28] <nothingmuch> 21 bst, appearantly

[13:28] <stevan> but porting it to Ruby/Python etc is not possible

[13:29] <nothingmuch> if daylight savings is in synch

[13:29] <kungfuftr> ah! k, well i should have more improved templates for you then

[13:29] <stevan> (it depends on mod_perl, DBI, etc)

[13:29] <nothingmuch> is gmtime 13:30 or 14:30?

[13:29] <nothingmuch> one can never trust computers when it comes to israeli DST, which is determined pretty much at random every year

[13:30] <nothingmuch> kungfuftr: goody =)

[13:30] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: use subversion!!

[13:30] <kungfuftr> since darcs is broken on *bsd currently

[13:30] <nothingmuch> kungfuftr: =(

[13:30] <kungfuftr> svk++

[13:30] <nothingmuch> my home box is disconnected too often for svn to be useful

[13:31] <nothingmuch> and i haven't really used svk enough

[13:31] <nothingmuch> i might sometime

[13:31] <kungfuftr> perfect usage for svk

[13:31] <nothingmuch> but i *really* like darcs

[13:31] <kungfuftr> it's very nice, bloody similar to svn

[13:31] <nothingmuch> and i have 0 time right now

[13:31] <kungfuftr> np! have fun

[13:31] <nothingmuch> especially with antihistemines ruining my sleep cycle

[13:32] <boogie> I'm trying to run module tests, and I got errors. Somebody can tell me, what' wrong?

[13:32] <nothingmuch> boogie: what are the errors?

[13:32] <nothingmuch> perlbot nopaste

[13:32] <perlbot> Paste your code here and #<channel> will be able to view it: http://sial.org/pbot/<channel>

[13:32] <boogie> This is the messege from the *.t files: /.../boogie/work/pugss/pugs/blib/script/pugs: No such file or directory

[13:33] <nothingmuch> btw, i didn't get to read(), i'm being suffocated today

[13:33] <nothingmuch> how are you running the *.t? prove? make test?

[13:33] <nothingmuch> hmm

[13:33] <nothingmuch> are you make installing?

[13:33] <nothingmuch> ./pugs t/foo.t?

[13:33] <autrijus> ok, regex patch is in.

[13:33] <boogie> make test in the pugs/ext/CGI/lib directory

[13:33] <autrijus> enjoy

[13:33] * nothingmuch 's never done that

[13:34] <nothingmuch> can't really say

[13:34] <nothingmuch> autrijus: releng issues?

[13:34] <nothingmuch> boogie: try HARNESS_PERL="/full/path/to/pugs"

[13:34] <nothingmuch> (the executable)

[13:34] <autrijus> nothingmuch: what releng issues? util/pugs_config.h not regenerated by default?

[13:34] <nothingmuch> no, what boogie is experiencing

[13:34] <autrijus> oh

[13:34] <nothingmuch> and then PERL6LIB="/ful/path/to/ext/Test/lib"

[13:35] <nothingmuch> export these two variables

[13:35] <autrijus> the tests are meant to be run from toplevel

[13:35] <autrijus> not from the ext/ itself

[13:35] <nothingmuch> and then try prove t/ in the dir

[13:35] <autrijus> that's all

[13:35] <autrijus> i.e. known issue. fixes welcom

[13:35] <autrijus> e

[13:35] <nothingmuch> Test::TAP::Visualize::HTMLMatrix is being tested to detah

[13:35] <autrijus> I want that :D

[13:35] <boogie> nothingmuch: read() is not a big problem, but it would be nice it would work. I you'll have some time, please try to hack in. ;)

[13:35] <nothingmuch> we have a home grown C++ unit framework

[13:35] <autrijus> nothingmuch: will you backport it to pugs?

[13:35] <nothingmuch> it's also using TAP

[13:35] <stevan> boogie: inside ext/CGI/ run this: prove -I lib/ t/*.t

[13:35] <stevan> that should work

[13:36] <nothingmuch> since it catches SEGV, divide by zero, and all other typically very fatal things it's the first use of Bail out i've seen

[13:36] <nothingmuch> so that is supported

[13:36] <nothingmuch> autrijus: it will stay p5, because i want it to use a templating toolkit

[13:36] <nothingmuch> but i will make testgraph.pl use it

[13:36] <boogie> autrijus: thanks for the tip :)

[13:36] <nothingmuch> Real Soon Now™

[13:37] <nothingmuch> btw, you can darcs get it

[13:37] <autrijus> nothingmuch: no, I mean port pugs to use that

[13:37] <autrijus> port the existing util/ stuff

[13:37] <autrijus> so, exactly what you just said :)

[13:37] <autrijus> Real Soon Now++

[13:38] <nothingmuch> i'll do that eventually

[13:38] <nothingmuch> that was the initial plan anyway

[13:38] <autrijus> nothingmuch++

[13:38] <nothingmuch> btw, kungfuftr: as far as I'm concerned, if you want write access to my public repo, and a shell on my box to use darcs, it can be arranged

[13:39] <kungfuftr> oh, got vim?

[13:39] <nothingmuch> is there any other editor?

[13:39] <nothingmuch> =D

[13:39] * nothingmuch just tought the new sysadmin some vim

[13:39] <nothingmuch> with a 3d matrix metaphor

[13:39] <kungfuftr> wait a sec

[13:39] <nothingmuch> and he basically said "cooooool"

[13:40] <kungfuftr> autrijus: can svk mirror darc repostiories?

[13:40] <autrijus> kungfuftr: no. want to help?

[13:40] <kungfuftr> doh

[13:40] <autrijus> VCP::src::darcs

[13:40] * nothingmuch planned on doing that

[13:40] <nothingmuch> =(

[13:40] <nothingmuch> but then again, i didn't learn SVK either

[13:40] <autrijus> or just a simple darcs2svn

[13:40] <autrijus> and we can reuse that

[13:40] * stevan needs to try out SVK again

[13:40] <nothingmuch> there's darcs2svn

[13:40] <nothingmuch> the other way is a bit harder

[13:40] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: i've never used darcs, but hey, i can learn

[13:41] <nothingmuch> it's very simple

[13:41] <nothingmuch> so i doubt there'll be any trouble

[13:41] <kungfuftr> yeah, sounds like a plan then

[13:41] <nothingmuch> kungfuftr: there was a small Petal error in my template, btw

[13:41] <nothingmuch> i fixed it now

[13:41] <kungfuftr> ah, might be changed code, etc

[13:41] <nothingmuch> what login would you like?

[13:43] <kungfuftr> kungfuftr/scott

[13:43] <kungfuftr> either or

[13:48] <nothingmuch> http://www.zanorg.com/pitbull/shakingpope.swf

[14:02] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: ta!

[14:17] <cognominal> wky so much hate. this guy  was about the only one fighting against all sort of slavery invented in the sake of liberalism. This flash game is fun, though.

[14:17] <nothingmuch> i don't think he was bad

[14:17] <nothingmuch> it's all good fun

[14:17] <cognominal> :)

[14:18] <nothingmuch> i think our own religeon-monkies are much worse

[14:19] <nothingmuch> they are corrupt, vile, hateful, and manupulative

[14:19] <stevan> cognominal: I dont think it's hate,... a little mean spirited maybe

[14:19] <stevan> and you have to realize that to some people (ex-catholics) he symbolizes a lot of negative things

[14:19] <cognominal> I hated instutionalized religion, his marial cult was almost paganist and his postion of contraception was backward. but he was probably the best pope catholicsm could have.

[14:20] <stevan> cognominal: yes, but that is not saying much :)

[14:20] * nothingmuch doesn't know enough to enter this argument

[14:20] <cognominal> and if they elect a pope in the southern hemisphere, this can shake things.

[14:20] <stevan> the contraception position alone can be used to blame much of the AIDS crisis in africa

[14:21] <stevan> I personally am hoping for a non-european pope 

[14:21] <stevan> by which I mean an african or south american

[14:21] <stevan> that alone will force so many people to deal with their own personal latent racism

[14:21] <nothingmuch> that could be cool

[14:21] <stevan> and I think that is a good thing :)

[14:22] <nothingmuch> stevan++

[14:22] <stevan> nothingmuch++

[14:22] <stevan> but then again I am a bitter ex-catholic, so I should probably not talk anymore about this :)

[14:23] <cognominal> I had a friend, a born provocative, who went to a moonist church and said he could not accept tha the leader of a church cannot be white :)

[14:24] <cognominal> ok, back to learning haskell

[14:24] <stevan> cognominal: the reign of the white european will hopefully end soon,.. we (I am one) have not done a very good job IMO

[14:24] <cognominal> stevan: just see the AUTHORS in pugs :)

[14:24] <stevan> cognominal: yup :)

[14:25] <stevan> Pugs is mucho internationale

[14:25] * stevan just makes up languages sometimes

[14:25] <autrijus> o/~ l'internationale / unites the sentient races o/~

[14:25] <cognominal> and most good research papers in the states are by indian or chinese. This say much about the future of the states

[14:26] * stevan tries to light an american flag on fire .... :P

[14:27] <cognominal> I will denounce you as a terrorist

[14:27] <nothingmuch> update AUTHORS

[14:27] * stevan damn lighter is not working

[14:27] * nothingmuch bought a zipp

[14:27] <nothingmuch> o

[14:27] <nothingmuch> that usually works

[14:27] <autrijus> mmm more right-to-left love

[14:27] <nothingmuch> not that i smoke that often

[14:28] <stevan> cognominal: bah! I've been on The List for years

[14:28] <stevan> it all started with that trip to the Soviet embassy in Mexico city with my buddy Lee Harvey

[14:28] <cognominal> come to Europe, we are decadent, but at least we know about it.

[14:29] <stevan> cognominal: I used to live in Germany, I miss it actually

[14:29] * stevan 's father worked for the US Govt. for 20 years

[14:30] <cognominal> I must say I like European cities in that states, like SF or NY.

[14:30] <stevan> I used to live in NYC too :)

[14:30] <stevan> but rents got too much and my wife had twins and we needed room :)

[14:31] <rgs> stevan: so maybe you know about the ^Hatalien landing field in nevada ?

[14:31] <rgs> http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.627187,-116.847925&spn=0.020814,0.030427&t=k&hl=en

[14:31] <rgs> s/atalien/alien/ :)

[14:32] <stevan> rgs: not that branch of the Govt :)

[14:32] <rgs> :)

[14:32] <stevan> (although that would have been really cool)

[14:32] <nothingmuch> mom? where's dad? is he coming home?

[14:32] <stevan> actually he used to investigate fraud in govt. contracting,.. so I was raised to be very anti-corporate (which makes job hunting hard)

[14:32] <nothingmuch> no, Stevan, he is working very hard on something

[14:33] <stevan> ground control to stevan's dad......

[14:33] <nothingmuch> in fact, he worked so hard, that the gov't decided to reward him, and give him a sort of, vacation

[14:33] <stevan> LOL

[14:33] <stevan> I'm half martian :P

[14:36] <stevan> I actually tend to not believe in govt. conspiracies because I know how f*cked up and confused the govt. is and know that they could not pull anything so complex off

[14:36] <cognominal> I was searching that quote.   America is the only country that went from barbarism to decadence without civilization in between.? Oscar Wilde. Hopefully american in the perl communauty are very nice

[14:36] <nothingmuch> that's why the MIB excuse is there

[14:36] <nothingmuch> conspiracies above the govt

[14:36] <stevan> cognominal: thats a great quote

[14:36] <nothingmuch> to make sure it's done right ;-)

[14:37] * stevan hears a knock on his door and hides under his desk

[14:39] <nothingmuch> oh crap, there's my old house!

[14:39] <nothingmuch> http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.627187,-116.847925&spn=0.020814,0.030427&t=k&hl=en

[14:39] <nothingmuch> no wait

[14:39] <nothingmuch> how do you take a link to a google map?

[14:40] <theorbtwo> Click the "link to this page" link in the upper-right corner.

[14:40] <nothingmuch> oops

[14:40] <nothingmuch> theorbtwo++

[14:42] <stevan> there is my old building: http://maps.google.com/maps?q=1619+3rd+ave,New+York,+NY&ll=40.78292369842529,-73.95159244537354&spn=0.019354820251464844,0.024805068969726562&t=k&hl=en

[14:42] <stevan> google maps ++

[14:42] <theorbtwo> Sadly, there is horrible resolution around where I used to live.

[14:42] <stevan> theorbtwo: yeah the same with my current house

[14:43] <theorbtwo> Oddly, there's a seam along the exact borders of Massachusetts.

[14:43] <clkao> win23

[14:53] <stevan> ok I am off to $work, later all

[15:00] <nothingmuch> beh, back

[15:07] <boogie> Hmm. I'm not sure, but it seems to me, that something broken with the current pugs version. When I'm trying to run tests of the CGI modul, it gives no error, but going to sleep during testing.

[15:08] <boogie> Maybe regexp? Can somebody check it? Revision 1962 is OK.

[16:11] * theorbtwo wonders if it's too early to start thinking about a gtk binding via gtk2hs.

[16:17] <crysflame> hello stack of commits

[16:36] <gaal> theorbtwo, not to early

[16:37] <gaal> me want me want

[16:37] <gaal> though we do need objects.

[16:40] <theorbtwo> Exactly my wonderment.

[16:41] <theorbtwo> ...esp because there does not seem to be a callback in place for "a method got called on us" in the IType system.

[16:42] <theorbtwo> I could do a lot of faking, but I'd prefer to not do that now, since it'd just mean a rewrite latter down the chute.

[16:48] <autrijus> cwest: oh. you're here.

[16:48] * autrijus switches channel

[16:55] <jabbot> pugs - 1970 - Upgraded HTML::Entities and discovered t

[16:55] <stevan> kungfuftr: do you have that URL for nothingmuch's Test::TAP darcs repo?

[17:01] <stevan> boogie: you need to add yourself to the AUTHORS file, and the CGI AUTHORS section

[17:04] <autrijus> ...and thus make hangman.p6 more challenging to win

[17:04] <autrijus> ...which is a Good Thing

[17:04] <stevan> ;)

[17:04] * stevan is off to have lunch

[17:08] <boogie> stevan: ok

[17:08] <boogie> autrijus: :D

[17:08] <ninereasons> is there an svn command to delete everything with status "?", as listed by "svn status" ?

[17:10] <autrijus> svn status | grep ^\\? | xargs rm

[17:10] <autrijus> or, easier:

[17:10] <autrijus> rm -rf *; svn up

[17:10] <autrijus> :)

[17:11] <ninereasons> I've done the second one,  often enough :)

[17:22] <kungfuftr> bbiam

[17:25] <jabbot> pugs - 1971 - * :i :m :s :x now all work in :P5 mode.

[17:26] <autrijus> stevan: larry overruled us

[17:26] <autrijus> so, no /x by default

[17:36] <crysflame> :(

[17:38] <autrijus> that means you won't have to rewrite your old regex when porting over tho.

[17:44] <ingy> hola

[17:45] <autrijus> yo ingy.

[17:45] <autrijus> I'm journaling, about to sleep

[17:45] <jabbot> pugs - 1972 - ":perl5" modifier now spelled ":Perl5"

[17:54] <gaal> autrijus: bug in the changelog/latest journal entry. [1..10][0] != 0 :)

[17:55] <ingy> :)

[17:56] <autrijus> ...

[17:56] <autrijus> it's assignment

[17:56] <autrijus> assignment!

[17:56] <crysflame> heh

[17:56] <gaal> haha

[17:56] <masak> :)

[17:57] <gaal> with autovivification even

[17:57] <gaal> well, potentially.

[17:58] <autrijus> yup

[18:00] <gaal> my $x; $x[2][1][0]="liftof"; $x.perl.say

[18:01] <autrijus> that looks good

[18:01] <gaal> yes

[18:01] <gaal> except i should spell it "liftoff". :)

[18:02] <theorbtwo> Allo, autrijus, the newly-natively-spelled-in-AUTHORS gaal, others.

[18:02] <gaal> urrr?

[18:02] <wolverian> hello.

[18:02] <wolverian> sleeping through the day is the best thing ever.

[18:03] <wolverian> is there any patch limit for adding oneself to AUTHORS?

[18:03] <gaal> aha! that nothingmuch, less pizza for him :)

[18:03] <autrijus> journal up. g'nite!

[18:03] <wolverian> good night. :)

[18:03] <gaal> night autrijus

[18:05] <kungfuftr> moo

[18:11] * theorbtwo notices that Autrijus never answered my question about gtk.

[18:13] <autrijus> theorbtwo: it's never too early. go for it.

[18:13] <autrijus> 'nite! &

[18:15] <kungfuftr> autrijus: know anything about web access on pasta.woobling.org?

[18:15] <theorbtwo> G'night.

[18:16] <castaway> it belongs to nothingmuch

[18:17] <kungfuftr> yeah, to to find a way to get http access to my account

[18:17] <castaway> http access?

[18:20] <kungfuftr> ah

[18:22] <ninereasons> i'm irritated that I misread iblech's bug report

[18:23] <castaway> in the channel?

[18:23] <ninereasons> no, a committed pugsbug

[18:24] <ninereasons> i seem to be having more trouble with english than with perl 

[18:24] <ninereasons> not a good sign at my age.

[18:24] <castaway> awww

[18:25] * theorbtwo wonders what that age is.

[18:25] <jabbot> pugs - 1973 - Updated qotw-regular-24.p6 to work aroun

[18:25] <jabbot> pugs - 1974 - The context inside of hash and array con

[18:25] <jabbot> pugs - 1975 - * P5 flags are now spelled as :P5<imsgx>

[18:25] <ninereasons> ancient, by pugs norms.

[18:26] <castaway> I think you're getting forgetful in your young age, love

[18:26] <theorbtwo> Getting?

[18:26] <castaway> ok, are ;)

[18:26] <ninereasons> I think i might be the oldest here, and perhaps the least experienced as well - at 48

[18:26] <theorbtwo> Ah.

[18:26] * castaway was close, said 47 ;)

[18:27] <castaway> you must look younger, ninereasons ;)

[18:27] <ninereasons> http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=44862

[18:28] <castaway> ooh, black&white.. ancient ,)

[18:28] <ninereasons> :)

[18:30] <theorbtwo> 9: Larry is older then you.

[18:32] <ninereasons> yes, but he doesn't hang around here.  lots of young people in #perl6

[18:32] * ninereasons hates the sound it makes when he says "young people"

[18:32] <castaway> heh

[18:32] <kungfuftr> yay!

[18:33] <castaway> yay?

[18:33] <ninereasons> access to pasta? 

[18:35] <ninereasons> kungfufter, celebrating all alone?  where's the fun?

[18:36] <castaway> Corion!

[18:37] <Corion> castaway!

[18:38] * Corion would really like it if the people changing Pugs --version would also change the tests they break.

[18:40] <kungfuftr> ninereasons: heh... well if i can remember how to set up my own local perllib, everything will be hokeydokey

[18:41] * Corion wonders why tests show as broken in the test graph, but work when run from the command line ...

[18:41] <ninereasons> Corion,  a harness thing, maybe?

[18:42] <Corion> ninereasons: Might be, yes ...

[19:08] <nothingmuch> good evening

[19:08] <castaway> 4nm!

[19:08] <castaway> oops s/4//

[19:08] <nothingmuch> 3cast34y!

[19:08] <theorbtwo> ~~0

[19:08] <stevan> nothingmuch: mah main man

[19:09] <nothingmuch> stevan: their auxillery woman!

[19:09] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: yullo

[19:09] <nothingmuch> hola kungfuftr 

[19:10] <nothingmuch> i am back early, as you can see

[19:10] * kungfuftr hacking now

[19:10] <nothingmuch> as we say in hebrew, someone banged up a tap for me

[19:10] <Corion> kungfuftr: Looks nice indeed

[19:10] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: http://pasta.woobling.org/~kungfuftr/Test-TAP-Visualize-HTMLMatrix/example.xhtml (improved version)

[19:10] <nothingmuch> (tap, like a water tap)

[19:10] <nothingmuch> ooh, purrrdy

[19:10] <nothingmuch> what about spreading them out nicely?

[19:11] <kungfuftr> oh? that not werking for you?

[19:11] <nothingmuch> nope

[19:11] <kungfuftr> hhhmmm... odd

[19:11] <Corion> Spreads nicely over 100% of the body for me

[19:11] <nothingmuch> i'll try to see why

[19:11] <Corion> (where conventional lotion only covers 95% of my body)

[19:12] <nothingmuch> i'm also not seeing bgcolor for testrunpercent

[19:12] <nothingmuch> Corion: no visual metaphors please

[19:12] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: which browser?

[19:13] <nothingmuch> sort of

[19:13] <nothingmuch> safari

[19:13] <nothingmuch> which ~~ konqueror

[19:13] <kungfuftr> ah, khtml--

[19:15] <nothingmuch> i think maybe the display: table stuff is giving it crap

[19:16] <kungfuftr> yeah, safari isn't CSS2 compliant yet

[19:16] <nothingmuch> oi crapxor

[19:30] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: any idea what the .nottest class is for?

[19:30] <nothingmuch> yes

[19:30] <nothingmuch> diag from before test output

[19:30] <nothingmuch> but it's not in template.html yet

[19:30] <nothingmuch> i was doing edge cases on bail out behavior today

[19:32] <stevan> hey I was thinking

[19:32] <stevan> I dont like YAML

[19:32] <stevan> (no offense INGY)

[19:32] <stevan> how flexible is the underlying Test::Harness collector

[19:32] <nothingmuch> that's why Test::TAP::Model is agnostic

[19:33] <stevan> can I write an XML::SAX collector?

[19:33] <nothingmuch> it is a subclass of Test::Harness::Straps

[19:33] <stevan> nothingmuch++

[19:33] <nothingmuch> that's pretty easy

[19:33] <nothingmuch> override _handle_test in Test::TAP::Model

[19:33] <stevan> gaal++ # cause it was his cracked out idea to start with

[19:33] <nothingmuch> to generate events instead

[19:33] <stevan> cool I will look into that later tonight maybe

[19:33] <nothingmuch> (actually i am shamelessly taking credit for that, it's just that i never got around to it, and he did ;-)

[19:33] * theorbtwo needs a project.

[19:34] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: you might need to darcs get

[19:34] <stevan> theorbtwo: you like XML::SAX?

[19:34] <nothingmuch> i'll do it momentarily

[19:34] * stevan really likes XML::SAX

[19:34] <theorbtwo> Not purticularly.

[19:34] <stevan> theorbtwo: you'll love it :)

[19:34] <stevan> none of this tree building crap,.. pure stream/event based processing

[19:34] <stevan> very clean, very nice

[19:34] <theorbtwo> I think the stuff in util/ works fine, and am not purticularly intersted in rewriting the stuff that's already there without making it appreciblally better.

[19:35] * theorbtwo finds print to be a very nice clean way of generating HTML.

[19:35] <stevan> theorbtwo: well at least for Test::TAP::Model I dont like having YAML as a dependency because it seems to have issues 

[19:35] <kungfuftr> theorbtwo: should have a peek at the testgraph i did

[19:35] <nothingmuch> stevan: i prefer Storable for it because it's much faster

[19:36] <nothingmuch> theorbtwo: sinner

[19:36] <theorbtwo> YAML is diffable, though, which can be nice.

[19:36] <nothingmuch> i see serializing modules this way:

[19:36] <stevan> so is XML

[19:36] <nothingmuch> YAML is for humans

[19:36] <nothingmuch> Data::Dumper is for debugging

[19:36] <nothingmuch> Storable is for storing

[19:37] <kungfuftr> how often does anyone _actually_ look at yaml that's used for serialisation?

[19:37] <stevan> XML is streamable too,.. YAML is not

[19:37] <nothingmuch> YAML is also nice for config files

[19:38] <nothingmuch> YAML is supposed to be streamable

[19:38] <stevan> nothingmuch: it is not

[19:38] <theorbtwo> Also, XML knows how to deal with charsets.

[19:38] <stevan> you have to build the whole thing at once

[19:38] <theorbtwo> XML is understood by people outside of the perl world.

[19:38] <stevan> before you write it

[19:38] <stevan> theorbtwo: naw yur cookin!

[19:39] <theorbtwo> In any case, like I said, I think there are no major problems with the util/ stuff as it exists, and am not purticularly interested in a rewrite that does not have substantitive new features that interest me.

[19:39] <nothingmuch> i think doclinker should be generailzed into a module

[19:39] <stevan> its less for util/ and more for Test::TAP::Model

[19:40] * nothingmuch debugs

[19:40] <theorbtwo> I think the stuff in util could be cp'd and released as a bunch of scripts without major changes.

[19:40] <theorbtwo> ...and I'd prefer the end-result doesn't require much more then it already does.

[19:41] <stevan> theorbtwo: aside from the doclinker,.. thats what Test::TAP::Model is right?

[19:42] <theorbtwo> As far as I could tell from what I looked at the other day, Test::TAP::Model was a rewrite with a big dependency or three.

[19:42] <stevan> what deps?

[19:42] <theorbtwo> Er, wait.

[19:42] <theorbtwo> Test::TAP::Model isn't what I mean.

[19:42] <theorbtwo> I mean Test::TAP::Visualizer::HTMLMatrix

[19:42] <stevan> yes

[19:43] <nothingmuch> Test::TAP::Model? no deps

[19:43] <nothingmuch> Test::TAP::Visualize::HTMLMatrix needs Petal

[19:43] <nothingmuch> that's all

[19:43] * nothingmuch prefers dependancies over flakiness

[19:43] * theorbtwo doesn't think his code is flakey.

[19:43] <nothingmuch> there were many cases it didn't handle

[19:43] <nothingmuch> and it was pretty hard to read

[19:43] <nothingmuch> and harder to modif

[19:43] <stevan> nothingmuch: is ::HTMLMatrix structured that we can use any template module?

[19:43] <nothingmuch> IMHO

[19:43] <nothingmuch> stevan: in theory yes

[19:44] <nothingmuch> it's basically just marrying Test::TAP::Model with Petal

[19:44] <nothingmuch> in not too many lines of code

[19:44] <theorbtwo> Oh, you should have said something; I would have put in another sub or two.

[19:44] <stevan> Test::TAP::Visualizer::HTML::Template , etc etc etc

[19:44] <nothingmuch> TT should be tres simple

[19:44] <stevan> TT can be a pain to install sometimes

[19:44] <stevan> ideally it can support all forms of templating,... even print()

[19:45] <stevan> plugins man,... plugins

[19:45] <nothingmuch> too much for 0.01

[19:45] <stevan> wussy

[19:45] * theorbtwo shrugs.

[19:45] <nothingmuch> i was concentrating on Test::TAP::Model

[19:45] <nothingmuch> which is where the logic is at

[19:45] <theorbtwo> You're welcome to do whatever you like with my code, just credit me and I'm fine.

[19:45] <nothingmuch> theorbtwo: you shall be

[19:46] <nothingmuch> worry not

[19:55] * masak says good night

[19:55] <nothingmuch> night

[19:55] <jabbot> pugs - 1980 - LWP::Simple test fix

[19:57] <stevan> nothingmuch: what time is it there for you?

[19:57] <nothingmuch> 22:57

[19:58] <Limbic_Region> chip about?

[19:58] <Limbic_Region> seen chip?

[19:58] <jabbot> Limbic_Region: chip was seen on Fri Apr  8 19:06:05 2005 GMT

[20:01] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: there be no more HTML!!

[20:01] <nothingmuch> aaah! what have you done?

[20:02] <nothingmuch> what have you done with it's body?

[20:02] <kungfuftr> it's still here, the rest is all xml now though (apart from links)

[20:04] <kungfuftr> should be some more tidying up and that's be about it

[20:04] * nothingmuch tries very hard to think of another ref to brazil, but just cann't

[20:04] * kungfuftr & # food

[20:04] <nothingmuch> ok

[20:04] <nothingmuch> how about khtml?

[20:05] <kungfuftr> not css2 compliant, gecko and opera are the closest tbh

[20:05] <nothingmuch> so we just drop support? i'm not sure that's a good idea

[20:05] <Corion> khtml ... KDE is for losers anyway! :-)))

[20:06] <nothingmuch> khtml is used by safari too

[20:06] <nothingmuch> and that's me

[20:06] <nothingmuch> and i will use the module

[20:06] <nothingmuch> baaah!

[20:06] *** co3 is now known as co2

[20:06] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: screenshot?

[20:06] <nothingmuch> sure

[20:06] <nothingmuch> ooh, testgraph.pl wrangled

[20:06] <nothingmuch> that was easy

[20:07] <nothingmuch> as soon as i found out that _init was not calling SUPER::_init

[20:07] <nothingmuch> gaal--; # not very careful

[20:09] <nothingmuch> http://nothingmuch.woobling.org/badkhtml.jpg

[20:10] <kungfuftr> hhhmmm... i sorta had to put a hack in for that... 2 secs, see if i can get it in another way

[20:11] <Corion> nothingmuch: Looks like a VU meter - funny too :)

[20:11] <nothingmuch> vu meter?

[20:11] <Corion> nothingmuch: Loudness / volume indicator

[20:11] <nothingmuch> ah

[20:11] <Corion> http://www.google.com/search?&q=vu%20meter%20image&sourceid=firefox

[20:12] <Corion> (google displays two images directly on the results page for me)

[20:12] <Corion> "Google, the Emacs of Webservices" -- seen on slashdot

[20:12] <Corion> ... but it doesn't show any images for "hardcore porn" on the search results page :)

[20:12] <nothingmuch> when we have google os

[20:12] <nothingmuch> that will auto spell check your syscalls

[20:12] <nothingmuch> then i'll agree with that quote

[20:12] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: try now

[20:13] <nothingmuch> blammo!

[20:13] <kungfuftr> moo?

[20:13] <nothingmuch> however: <testpercent style="background-color: #00ff00">100.00%</testpercent>

[20:13] <nothingmuch> the style="" is a no op

[20:14] <nothingmuch> btw, i would like to keep status=failed etc at 1 char

[20:14] <nothingmuch> and make it reaaaaallly concise

[20:14] <nothingmuch> because this stuff *grows*

[20:15] <kungfuftr> bad idea, tbh. it's like having 15,000 lines of code with 2 character variable names

[20:15] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: so it working for you now?

[20:15] <nothingmuch> the table is working

[20:15] <kungfuftr> yay!

[20:15] <nothingmuch> but the % column is all white

[20:16] <kungfuftr> screen shot?

[20:16] <nothingmuch> the style="background-color: #xxxxxx" stuff is not working

[20:16] <nothingmuch> the old screenshot applies

[20:16] <nothingmuch> the reason i want 1 char classes/attrs is that this makes it shrink by several kilobytes

[20:17] <nothingmuch> the std testgraph.pl html is around 1mb

[20:17] <Corion> 800k for me

[20:17] <nothingmuch> btw, i think there should be a black border on the left side of the whole table

[20:18] <nothingmuch> and that the test "status" should be centered

[20:18] <nothingmuch> and that "test file" should have colspan=2

[20:18] <nothingmuch> but i don't insist

[20:18] <nothingmuch> i would like some convincing though

[20:18] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: colspan is impossible unfortunately

[20:18] <nothingmuch> ah

[20:19] <kungfuftr> not sure what's going on with the testpercent stuff

[20:19] <kungfuftr> think there's another possibility though

[20:20] <nothingmuch> =/

[20:21] <nothingmuch> theorbtwo: did you ever get around to hooking svn log -> authors -> coopyright?

[20:22] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: can you give me the rgb values for 0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100 percent?

[20:22] <nothingmuch> the value is not hard coded

[20:22] <nothingmuch> see Test::TAP::Visualize::HTMLMatrix::Colorful

[20:23] <nothingmuch> my current thoughts are: XML for display might not be ready, if browser support is lacking

[20:23] <nothingmuch> perhaps if it ain't broke we shouldn't fix it?

[20:23] <nothingmuch> i would prefer, given current status of KHTML to backport the change

[20:23] <nothingmuch> keep your patch around, but work on it

[20:23] <nothingmuch> and in due time revert the patch that converts it to regular HTML

[20:24] <kungfuftr> hhhmmm...

[20:24] <nothingmuch> return sprintf("#ff%02x%02x", $l + ((255 - $l) * $ratio), $l-20);

[20:24] <nothingmuch> $l is at 100

[20:24] <nothingmuch> it gives it a slightly softer tone

[20:24] <kungfuftr> bollocks that i don't have safari locally to test

[20:25] <nothingmuch> true that

[20:30] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: try now

[20:31] <nothingmuch> nope

[20:31] <nothingmuch> same old

[20:31] <kungfuftr> should be a failure in the list, right?

[20:31] <nothingmuch> yes

[20:31] <nothingmuch> there is

[20:31] <nothingmuch> but the 100% isn't green

[20:31] <nothingmuch> and the 90+% isn't yellow

[20:32] <nothingmuch> the matrix cells /are/ green and red

[20:32] <kungfuftr> yeah, is here... very very weird

[20:32] <kungfuftr> safari's not even obeying !important

[20:32] <nothingmuch> *sigh*

[20:32] <nothingmuch> technology sucks so much

[20:33] <kungfuftr> 2 secs

[20:37] <crysflame> safari normally obeys !important? that's odd

[20:37] <gaal> yo.

[20:37] <nothingmuch> hola gaal 

[20:37] <kungfuftr> ah, safari rendering bug

[20:37] <kungfuftr> quirksmode++

[20:39] <kungfuftr> 2 mins

[20:40] <gaal> ooh, we have a workable new smoke system?

[20:40] <gaal> shiny shiny, shiny new smoke system

[20:40] <gaal> new smoke system, in the dark

[20:41] <nothingmuch> not really

[20:41] <nothingmuch> oh my gawwwwed

[20:41] <nothingmuch> layout completely screwey

[20:41] <gaal> with red and green, tooltips that do delight 'er

[20:41] <nothingmuch> safari is annoying

[20:41] <gaal> come on baby, smoke for me!

[20:41] <nothingmuch> kungfuftr: i think that it's too early for XML

[20:42] <stevan> gaal++ # for the VU ref

[20:42] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: yeah, most places don't support it...

[20:42] <kungfuftr> i think safari's too early for XML

[20:42] <kungfuftr> =0)

[20:42] <nothingmuch> too bad

[20:42] <nothingmuch> well, stevan is planning on making an XML backend anyway

[20:42] <nothingmuch> i think

[20:42] <nothingmuch> or is it just SAX?

[20:43] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: why safari?

[20:43] <stevan> nothingmuch: yup,... but just the backend Test::Harness stuff

[20:43] <nothingmuch> why do i use safari?

[20:43] <kungfuftr> yar... understand mac... but why not something gecko based?

[20:43] <nothingmuch> stevan: what kungfuftr did (http://pasta.woobling.org/~kungfuftr/Test-TAP-Visualize-HTMLMatrix/example.xhtml) was try to get it to both be displayable and minable at the same time

[20:43] <nothingmuch> my puter is hella slow

[20:43] <nothingmuch> 400mhz

[20:43] <nothingmuch> firefox is much less responsive than safari

[20:44] <kungfuftr> never found that, and i use both

[20:44] <stevan> minable?

[20:44] <nothingmuch> much less stupidity... it works so well in hebrew!

[20:44] <nothingmuch> stevan: it's XML that makes sense

[20:44] <gaal> VU ref is even better than VUndef, i think.

[20:44] <kungfuftr> stevan: have a look at the source code of that xhtml page

[20:45] * gaal needs water

[20:45] <stevan> kungfuftr: very nice

[20:45] <stevan> works for me in Safari

[20:45] <nothingmuch> stevan: do the percentages on the right side have color?

[20:45] <stevan> no

[20:45] <jabbot> pugs - 1981 - Updates, clarifications, and expansions 

[20:45] <nothingmuch> i think we should stick with plain old HTML

[20:46] <nothingmuch> (xhtml ;-)

[20:46] <nothingmuch> so it's not just my box

[20:46] <nothingmuch> beh

[20:46] <stevan> I tend to agree with nothingmuch  on this

[20:46] * kungfuftr will play tomorrow on the mac at work

[20:46] <stevan> at least for now

[20:46] <nothingmuch> but keep the changes somewhere

[20:46] <nothingmuch> kungfuftr: can you commit the change?

[20:46] <stevan> *cough* plugins *cough*

[20:46] <nothingmuch> so that i can backport?

[20:46] <nothingmuch> stevan: patches welcome ;-)

[20:46] <stevan> some organizations may want this

[20:46] <nothingmuch> i want to do basic releng today

[20:46] <stevan> nothingmuch: don't make me do it!!!! I'm just crazy enough!!!!

[20:47] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: commit, how?

[20:47] <nothingmuch> kungfuftr: darcs whatsnew

[20:47] <gaal> heh, nothingmuch, you should port Object::Meta::plugin to perl6 :)

[20:47] <nothingmuch> darcs record

[20:47] <nothingmuch> gaal: i think there will be no need

[20:47] <stevan> gaal: would he need too?

[20:47] <nothingmuch> for a while at least

[20:47] <stevan> $object.meta.* should do enough I would think

[20:47] <nothingmuch> roles (per object) do most of what it does

[20:47] <nothingmuch> stevan: you *so* don't want to know what Object::Meta::Plugin does

[20:47] <nothingmuch> as for plugging in templates:

[20:48] <stevan> gaal: if nothingmuch sets up that bit torrent server he promised too (poke poke) then I got some nice VU stuff to share

[20:48] <nothingmuch> i don't want to do it yet because the petal <-> Test::TAP::Model bridge is very thin at the moment

[20:48] <nothingmuch> i'll do that now

[20:49] <gaal> stevan: in Dichotomy Deset Island Land, would you bring John Cale or Lou Reed with you?

[20:49] <gaal> (well, their ALBUMS I mean. :)

[20:49] <stevan> Lou Reed

[20:49] <gaal> was it a hard choice?

[20:49] <stevan> but thats because I really love the "New York" Album

[20:50] <stevan> not really.

[20:50] <stevan> gaal: and you?

[20:50] <nothingmuch> kungfuftr: so what's next?

[20:50] <gaal> I'd pick John Cale, but I'll miss Berlin. And Transformer. And Magic and Loss. :/

[20:50] <stevan> Transformer is a great album

[20:50] <gaal> yes.

[20:51] <gaal> I don't know the New York one!

[20:51] <stevan> gaal: even more of a reason for nothingmuch to get the server up

[20:51] <gaal> hehheh

[20:51] <nothingmuch> one minute please, i'm reading up on how

[20:51] <stevan> it came out in the early 90s,.. when Lou was in his "Rock and Roll should be pure" phase

[20:51] <gaal> i don't think I'll be listening to a lot of music soon though :(

[20:52] <gaal> you mean purely beer?

[20:52] <nothingmuch> gaal: want to borrow my ipod?

[20:52] <stevan> gaal: they dont allow music in the big house

[20:52] <nothingmuch> it might get stolen

[20:52] <nothingmuch> but then again, i don't use it much anymore

[20:52] <stevan> 2 guitars, bass and drums,.. thats all

[20:52] <nothingmuch> haven't commuted by bus in a long while

[20:52] <stevan> gaal: soap on a rope,... get some

[20:52] <gaal> ?

[20:53] <stevan> it's an american jail thing

[20:53] <stevan> dont drop the soap in the showers

[20:53] * gaal thinks he doesn't wanna know :)

[20:53] <stevan> gaal: you dont :)

[20:53] <stevan> gaal++ # again for standing up for what you believe in

[20:54] <gaal> when i lived in the uk there was this commercial, eh, crap i forgot who it was with, some singer

[20:54] <stevan> I know if they did that in the States,.. I would have been a canadian long ago

[20:54] <gaal> he gets into trouble (it's a *series* of commercials) and in one of them he ends up in jail

[20:55] <gaal> there's a bit with the soap there too, though ha-ha-understated.

[20:55] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: ah ha... i know a fix

[20:55] <gaal> nm: an ipod will last about thirty seconds there. but thanks :)

[20:56] <stevan> gaal: you could trade it for protection from the big guys

[20:56] <gaal> s/will/would

[20:56] <stevan> or cigarettes

[20:56] <gaal> it's not that kind of prison

[20:56] <gaal> really won't be that bad. won't be fun, of course

[20:56] <stevan> gaal: can you bring books?

[20:57] <nothingmuch> pasta.woobling.org:7080

[20:57] <gaal> yes. i killed a tree the other day printing p6b

[20:57] <stevan> ah yeah you said that

[20:58] <gaal> plus i have: david lodge, richard russo, mikhail bulgakov, uh the guy who wrote fight club, and some others.

[20:59] <gaal> nm, is any of the new matrix stuff p6? i haven't had time to look at it

[20:59] <crysflame> p6b?

[21:00] <nothingmuch> gaal: no

[21:00] <nothingmuch> just your code in OOP

[21:00] <nothingmuch> and kungfuftr is working on the XH?TML output

[21:00] <gaal> "my" code, hah. that's mostly petdance's code, etc.

[21:00] <nothingmuch> nevermind

[21:00] <nothingmuch> =D

[21:01] <gaal> are we not doing it in p6 because pugs isn't there yet, or because we want this to be used in p5land?

[21:01] <gaal> (is there open| in pugs?)

[21:02] <nothingmuch> both, methinks

[21:05] <gaal> how's the upgrade path for tests of existing p5 moduels to p5? should we bother porting Test::*? From a clean slate POV probably it'd be best if we worked on a very strong single Test.pm, but i'm not sure how happy existing p5 authors would be when their hard work doesn't work any more

[21:05] <gaal> i mean, porting your moduel == fun

[21:05] <gaal> porting tests == less so, probably

[21:06] <nothingmuch> no clue

[21:06] <gaal> or at least, less necessarily

[21:06] <nothingmuch> i think i agree on strong single Test.pm

[21:06] <nothingmuch> but not 100%

[21:06] <nothingmuch> sometimes there are many ways to do one things

[21:06] <nothingmuch> is_deeply should be gone

[21:06] <gaal> well i sure don't want 15 separate modules - at least, not 15 separate distribs

[21:07] <nothingmuch> Test::Deep is the way for deep

[21:07] <nothingmuch> and not every one needs it

[21:07] <nothingmuch> Test::Exception should be core

[21:07] <nothingmuch> Test::NoWarnings is odd

[21:07] <nothingmuch> the Test::Distribution family is weird

[21:07] <nothingmuch> it's functionality should be in Test::Exceptions

[21:07] <nothingmuch> i think it should be STD

[21:07] <nothingmuch> but rethought, interface wise

[21:07] <gaal> sure, refactoring++

[21:07] <stevan> I agree,.. Test::Exceptions should go into Test.pm when we have CATCH

[21:07] <nothingmuch> Test::LongString is silly

[21:07] <stevan> i think chromatic was going to start on the Test::Builder port

[21:08] <nothingmuch> Test::Simple shouldn't exist

[21:08] <stevan> I love Test::Deep 

[21:08] <nothingmuch> Test::MockObject should stay (but get my patch ;-)

[21:08] <gaal> but i don't like how you have to install five modules just to test this nice thing you just d/led from cpan

[21:08] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: try now

[21:08] <nothingmuch> Test::Unit should be one and only

[21:08] <nothingmuch> woot!

[21:08] <stevan> Test::Simple would have been Test.pm if the name wasnt alreayd there

[21:09] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: they all working?

[21:09] <nothingmuch> it looks odd though

[21:09] <nothingmuch> but we do have color

[21:09] <kungfuftr> yeah, needs a little tweaking

[21:09] <nothingmuch> italic

[21:09] <nothingmuch> and boxed

[21:09] <nothingmuch> twice

[21:09] <gaal> any need to separate test::more and test::simple any, er, more?

[21:09] <nothingmuch> Test::Plan is nice

[21:09] <gaal> maybe test:simple can be a facade

[21:09] <nothingmuch> Test::More is Test

[21:10] <nothingmuch> Test::Simple is a subset

[21:10] <gaal> yes

[21:10] <nothingmuch> Test::Plan should be in Test too

[21:10] <gaal> so expose it just as a facade

[21:10] <gaal> but don't dupe code

[21:10] <gaal> what's test plan do, remind me?

[21:10] <nothingmuch> it's got an idiotic name

[21:10] *** Corion changes topic to: pugscode.org <<Overview Journal Logs>> | r1773/winxp: 587/4256 smoke/win2k (occasional): http://xrl.us/fqum (25/4321 , r1980) | pugs.kwiki.org

[21:10] <nothingmuch> but basically it's a quick way to do the

[21:10] <gaal> ah ah skip all

[21:10] <gaal> yes i remember

[21:11] <nothingmuch> BEGIN { eval { require Module::I::Need }; $@? plan skip_all : plan tests => 5 }

[21:11] <nothingmuch> i would have called it Test::Predicates or something

[21:11] <nothingmuch> but it should be core anyway

[21:11] <gaal> yeah. skip needs to be made stronger, sure

[21:11] <gaal> exactly

[21:11] <nothingmuch> Test::Block also helps skipping

[21:11] <nothingmuch> by telling in advance how many blocks are per block

[21:11] <nothingmuch> and then you say 'skip rest' and it gets the number right

[21:12] <nothingmuch> Test::strict should be Test::Distribution

[21:12] <nothingmuch> Test::Output should be in Test

[21:12] <gaal> i'm still not 100% convinced i like having to specify a plan number automatically

[21:12] <Corion> Somebody should port "release" / Module::Release!

[21:12] <gaal> err

[21:12] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: okay, should look better now

[21:12] <gaal> manually

[21:12] <kungfuftr> stevan: look okay for you?

[21:13] <nothingmuch> but it should overrid eonly when it's in effect

[21:13] <Corion> Specifying a plan number is important, especially as long as Pugs / Perl can silently quit your test.

[21:13] <gaal> yes, just i hate counting

[21:13] <gaal> i wish the computer would do it for me

[21:13] <nothingmuch> reload http://nothingmuch.woobling.org/badkhtml.jpg

[21:13] <nothingmuch> gaal: predeclaring is useful

[21:13] <gaal> i think i had this discussion before, nm was it with you?

[21:13] <nothingmuch> Test::Block just makes you do less arithmetic

[21:13] <nothingmuch> no, not with me

[21:14] <nothingmuch> but plans are optional, so it doesn't matter

[21:14] <nothingmuch> this is for skipping

[21:14] <gaal> like how i saw someone being clever, and declaring all his tests as closures and pushing them in an array

[21:14] <nothingmuch> *cough*

[21:14] <gaal> planning by @tests

[21:14] <gaal> then running them one by one

[21:14] <gaal> well look on the bright side

[21:14] <nothingmuch> i did that twidce

[21:14] <nothingmuch> MPEG::Audio::Frame did calc of plan

[21:14] <nothingmuch> but not with closures

[21:15] <gaal> if you get a parse error, it will die before you planned

[21:15] <nothingmuch> and Object::Meta::Plugin did not use Test::Builder at all

[21:15] <gaal> so the harness knows

[21:16] <gaal> the editor should perhaps have an "update plan" feature, if we don't go the clever route.

[21:17] <gaal> run the test, extract "looks like you only ran 2 tests out of 42" data, etc.

[21:17] <gaal> that's probably doable in perltest.vim

[21:20] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: now?

[21:20] <nothingmuch> almost

[21:21] <nothingmuch> now the border is OK

[21:21] <nothingmuch> but there is a light grey 

[21:21] <nothingmuch> the green is only as high as the text

[21:21] <kungfuftr> bah...

[21:21] <nothingmuch> i think this is too workaroundish

[21:21] <nothingmuch> you're working hard

[21:21] <nothingmuch> and without much  benefit

[21:21] <kungfuftr> not hugely, i do this sorta stuff for kicks

[21:21] <ingy> fyi YAML is very streamable

[21:22] <ingy> YAML.pm does not currently have a streamable interface

[21:22] <ingy> YAML and YAML.pm are very different things :)

[21:27] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: right... now?

[21:28] <nothingmuch> between the test case lists

[21:28] <nothingmuch> text is not vertical aligned, but all else is OK

[21:28] <nothingmuch> oh wait

[21:28] <nothingmuch> we have some odd 1px white boundries

[21:28] <nothingmuch> but only after the second row

[21:28] <nothingmuch> ..ML--

[21:28] <kungfuftr> bah... ffs safari sucks

[21:28] <nothingmuch> wait, no, CAML not mm

[21:28] <nothingmuch> --

[21:28] <nothingmuch> HTML--

[21:28] <nothingmuch> and ancestors, and derivs too

[21:30] <nothingmuch> woot, YAPC::NA will be on my birthday

[21:30] <nothingmuch> i think i'll try for a talk, maybe

[21:31] <nothingmuch> vertical align ok

[21:31] <nothingmuch> but we're back with whites

[21:31] <nothingmuch> on top and bottom of percent cell

[21:32] <nothingmuch> thin borders gone

[21:32] <nothingmuch> mldonkey is misbehaving

[21:40] <cognominal> ouch

[21:41] <cognominal> pugs> my $b = my $a = 1

[21:41] <cognominal> *** Error: No compatible subroutine found: &my

[21:41] <nothingmuch> hah

[21:41] <cognominal> pugs> my $a = 1

[21:41] <cognominal> undef

[21:41] <cognominal> my should be a function like in perl5?

[21:45] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: moo

[21:45] <nothingmuch> is?

[21:45] <nothingmuch> si?

[21:46] <kungfuftr> that any better?

[21:46] <nothingmuch> nope, the vertical-align is back

[21:46] <nothingmuch> but the white lines are gone

[21:47] <kungfuftr> vertical-align the only issue?

[21:47] <nothingmuch> yep

[21:47] <kungfuftr> yay

[21:49] <nothingmuch> no wait, i didn't notice

[21:49] <nothingmuch> but there's a margin between the cells

[21:49] <nothingmuch> about 3px

[22:01] <nothingmuch> gaal: ping

[22:06] <nothingmuch> damnit!

[22:11] <Limbic_Region> Janet - I love you

[22:12] <Limbic_Region> what - no RHPS fans

[22:12] * Limbic_Region does the Time Warp by himself 

[22:19] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: et voila

[22:19] <kungfuftr> if that don't work feck it

[22:19] <nothingmuch> ack

[22:19] <nothingmuch> borders screwed up

[22:19] <nothingmuch> cells small

[22:20] <nothingmuch> border-spacing between test cases is 0

[22:20] <nothingmuch> vertical align of percent cell is wrong

[22:20] <nothingmuch> safari--

[22:20] <nothingmuch> kungfuftr++

[22:22] <kungfuftr> bah, bugger it... would require a restructure of the dom

[22:22] <nothingmuch> i think this is too much

[22:22] <nothingmuch> the old mantra

[22:22] <nothingmuch> if it ain't broke don't fix it

[22:22] <nothingmuch> i think it applies here

[22:23] <kungfuftr> it's not that something's not broke, it something that would have provided two interfaces

[22:23] <kungfuftr> there's always xslt i suppose... *blink*

[22:23] <nothingmuch> nonononono!

[22:23] <nothingmuch> you can make Test::TAP::Visualize::XSLT if you want

[22:23] <nothingmuch> i'm not touching that with a 10" swede

[22:24] <kungfuftr> is there a TAP xml schema?

[22:24] <nothingmuch> not that I know of

[22:25] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: oh yeah, you should also try to capture time taken for test

[22:25] <nothingmuch> kungfuftr: test case?

[22:26] <kungfuftr> nothingmuch: moo?

[22:27] <nothingmuch> what do you want stamped?

[22:27] <nothingmuch> it can all be

[22:28] <kungfuftr> each sub test

[22:28] <kungfuftr> and tesfile i suppose

[22:28] <kungfuftr> bugger, all of it i suppose

[22:34] <nothingmuch> subtest timing is a simple case of adding the data in the _handle_test stuff

[22:34] <nothingmuch> btw, can you port your css to the original HTML?

[22:34] <nothingmuch> or should i do that?

[22:34] <nothingmuch> it's much prettier than mine

[22:35] <nothingmuch> (when it works ;-)

[22:53] <Ovid> Anyone know if "temp $var" is working yet in Pugs?  I assume it's not.

[23:35] <jabbot> pugs - 1982 - Could not make the method calls work in
