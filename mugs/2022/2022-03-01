[17:02] <japhb> jjatria: Pop hard-depends on a version of Color that no longer exists in the ecosystem.  Would you mind nudging that?

[17:03] <lizmat> japhb: which version?

[17:04] <japhb> ===> Failed to find dependencies: Color:ver<1.002008>

[17:05] <lizmat> zef install Zef::Configuration

[17:05] <lizmat> zef-configure enable rea

[17:05] <lizmat> zef install  'Color:ver<1.002008>'

[17:06] <lizmat> in other words: enable the REA, and you should be able to install the module

[17:06] <lizmat> also as a dependency

[17:07] <japhb> Hmmm, I'll start adding rea to my default rebuild-everything script for now.  I guess we need to get REA enabled by default in Zef sooner rather than later, if things are now breaking for lack of it.

[17:08] <lizmat> approving https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/pull/318 would help  :-)

[17:11] <japhb> Sorry, just getting back into the swing of things today.  Nasty bug since Friday.

[17:11] <japhb> Will take a look

[17:25] <japhb> Phew, I thought *not a single person* had replied to your review request, but it looks like you just requested those reviews 15 minutes ago.  I was going to wonder if we'd all simultaneously gotten sick or something.

[17:36] <lizmat> no, but I did post the PR a week ago

[17:36] <lizmat> but I guess everybody was distracted by other events  :-(

[17:36] <lizmat> I know I was / am

[17:54] <japhb> Yeah, I need to get back to that, too.  :-(

[17:56] <japhb> OK, I followed up on your question about ugexe's comment.  To be clear, I'm happy to approve otherwise, just want to clear up his feedback.

[17:57] <japhb> One of the previous review systems I used differentiated "LGTM" (looks good to me currently) from "Approve" (I have the authority to give the go-ahead and this change is clearly ready)

[17:57] <japhb> Kinda miss that
