[05:08] <japhb> Xliff: There are a lot of bug fixes in Terminal::Widgets 0.0.12; you may want to upgrade now for a better experience.

[09:13] <Xliff> Thanks.

[09:16] <Xliff> Why is 'color(0,0,0)' an "Invalid attribute name"?

[09:22] <Xliff> Oh! "color(...)" doesn't belong there, it just wants the comma separated values! 

[09:49] <japhb> Where are you talking about?

[09:50] <japhb> OH!  I see, you were trying to understand the color attribute syntax, got it.
