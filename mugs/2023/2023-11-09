[03:54] <Xliff> Thanks! :)

[03:54] <Xliff> Next question: Can menus scroll?

[03:54] <Xliff> I have a menu with a lot of options, and when I run it without a subset I get the following error:

[03:55] <Xliff> "Negative remaining height to distribute"

[04:25] <Xliff> I'd like to select from a menu of approximately 100 items, but do it from a normal sized terminal. How difficult would it be to make menu scroll? Is there anything existing in the current Terminal::Widgets that I could use as a guideline to add such a feature?

[04:25] <Xliff> Thanks.

[06:53] <japhb> Scrolling is only currently implemented for the log viewer, but yeah, that's on the list for other widgets (and forms in general) too.

[06:54] <japhb> It's late here; let me think about this tomorrow when my head's a little clearer.  :-)

[09:32] <Xliff> Cool deal. If you can do the design, I wouldn't mind working on the implementation.

[16:23] <Xliff> japhb: Good morning! How does your head feel?

[17:50] <Xliff> japhb: How is Terminal::Print::Widget's $!h attribute set when using a Terminal::Widgets::Input object like Terminal::Widgets::Input::Menu?

[23:56] <Xliff> Any thoughts on scrolling menus?
