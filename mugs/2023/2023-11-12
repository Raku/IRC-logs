[02:31] <Xliff> japhb: So THERE you are.

[05:29] <japhb> I AM A HIDDEN MYSTERY.

[05:29] <japhb> ;-)

[05:30] <japhb> I'm currently working on a version of your menu scrolling idea that has a little more DWIM to it.

[05:31] <japhb> I think it's interesting that you have menu items with their own color ... it's easy to support, but I'm curious what your use case is?

[06:49] <japhb> Got partway through my implementation, loosely based on yours. ^^

[06:50] <japhb> Was about to make an uber-example for several of the things you've asked about, but then discovered some layout bugs I need to hammer on.

[08:52] <Xliff> \o

[08:54] <Xliff> japhb: Primary use case is when you want to convey different states for the menu options. Consider my specific use case: EC2 instances... I'd like to see whether an instance is running at a glance, hence the colors.

[08:54] <Xliff> .terminal.set-toplevel doesn't seem to wanna work, BTW.

[17:47] <japhb> Ah, interesting case -- a way to compress a little more information in the same space, I like it.

[17:48] <japhb> Hmmm ... push your code (if you haven't already), and I'll take a look at what's gone wrong.

[22:49] <Xliff> Um. The issues with .terminal.set-toplevel aren't in anything repo-connected.

[22:49] <Xliff> It's a script I'm trying to develop for $dayJob.

[22:50] <Xliff> Could you work a quick example where you can switch between two form classes, and thus switch between two UI layouts?
