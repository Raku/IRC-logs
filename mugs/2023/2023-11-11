[00:56] <Xliff> japhb: Hey! Did you get a chance to review my PR?

[00:57] <Xliff> I'm hoping I can get your help on fixing the menu scrolling feature. Everything works except for the crash when using nextItem near (or at) the end of the list.

[10:33] <Xliff> japhb: What's the best way to switch from one form to another? App.boot-to-screen?

[23:41] <japhb> Sorry I've been unresponsive.  Life and all.

[23:42] <japhb> boot-to-X is a shorthand for first boot through first X.  It's not for switching screens/forms.

[23:47] <japhb> Switching to a new toplevel (once you've built it) is as simple as asking the Terminal object to do it for you: `$terminal.set-toplevel($new-toplevel)`

[23:49] <japhb> Depending on whether you are inside a widget that is *already* a TopLevel, `$terminal` may actually be found at `$.terminal` or `$.toplevel.terminal`

[23:50] <japhb> I'll take a look at the menu scrolling.
