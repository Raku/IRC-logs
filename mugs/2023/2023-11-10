[00:27] <Xliff> I think I have the basics down. I have a scrolling menu widget, but there are a few bugs in cases I should be able to figure out, but you could probably figure out faster.

[00:27] <Xliff> Interested?

[01:25] <japhb> Sorry, had some other things going on.  If you've got something in progress, I'd be happy to take a look.  :-)

[01:49] <Xliff> OK. Let me get everything committed.

[01:54] <Xliff> OK. New changes committed. These appear to have been ammended to the already open PR.
