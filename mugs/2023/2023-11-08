[02:50] <Xliff> japhb: The menu example in the Terminal-Widgets repo is now broken again. Can you fix that, please?

[03:25] <japhb> Xliff: I hadn't merged your menu example PR, because we hadn't finished the discussion at https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-Widgets/pull/2#issuecomment-1798844324

[03:26] <japhb> So *my* copy of the repo doesn't *have* a menu example.  :-)

[03:27] <japhb> And your repo appears to be out of date with respect to mine, so I can't ensure we're looking at the same thing.

[03:45] <Xliff> I submitted a PR.

[03:46] <Xliff> Not. My. Fault! :)

[04:45] <japhb> "The menu example in the Terminal-Widgets repo is now broken again." -- it's your repo, it's your change, and you have not pulled my latest commit.  How could I have broken your code, if you already had it working?

[04:55] <Xliff> japhb: Did you approve the PR?

[04:57] <japhb> No, see https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-Widgets/pull/2
