[14:45] <Guest56> hi

[14:46] <Guest56> I want to know if the pseudo-random number can be predicted?

[15:51] <japhb> Guest56: Raku uses a relatively modern PRNG (a variant of Mersenne Twister, if I recall correctly).  The pattern is statistically strong, but I don't think it is *cryptographically* strong.

[15:52] <japhb> In other words, you are unlikely to see biases or obvious human-intuitable patterns in the random number generation, but if you need crypto RNG to get a source of "entropy" data, use /dev/urandom, not the builtin PRNG.

[15:55] <japhb> (MUGS does not provide its own special PRNG, but I have considered allowing the creation of multiple *independent* PRNGs, so that users could seed them individually for repeatability where that is valuable.  That hasn't exactly reached the top of the todo list.  :-) )
