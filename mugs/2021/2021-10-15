[14:38] <lizmat> is there a URL for more info about MUGS ?

[15:18] <japhb> lizmat: If you're asking if there's a website, no.  The main MUGS docs are where most of the further info is, which is here: https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS/tree/main/docs

[15:18] <lizmat> https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS/tree/main/docs#readme perhaps better ?

[15:20] <japhb> Sure.  I suppose that's going to be better for people with limited screen area or using a screen reader, so ... SGTM
