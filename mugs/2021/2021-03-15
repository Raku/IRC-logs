[22:28] <lizmat> hi!
[22:28] <japhb> Hi there!  :-)
[22:29] <japhb> Hmmm, maybe I should release 0.0.5 and announce now that I'm on the runup to 0.1.0.
[22:34] <lizmat> yeah, feels like a plan to me
[23:01] <japhb> OK, 0.0.5 is released.  I seriously need to automate that process, sheesh.  Especially now that I have the release guide relatively accurate (for the core steps at least).

[23:03] <@japhb> ... though it looks like the zef ecosystem is still indexing it.  At least according to raku.land.
