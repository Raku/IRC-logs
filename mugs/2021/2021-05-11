[15:01] <jjatria> japhb: This blackjack game? https://gitlab.com/jjatria/pop-games/-/tree/master/blackjack
[15:02] <jjatria> I took a stab at integrating with MUGS but couldn't figure out how, and then got distracted with stuffs
[17:25] <japhb> jjatria: Yep, that's the one.
[17:26] <japhb> OK, it's clear from what you and [Coke] have said that very high on the list of needs for MUGS is one or more "How do I ...?" tutorials
[17:26] <japhb> Actually, anyone who has doc requests/suggestions, I'd be very interested.
[17:43] <[Coke]> japhb: where's an overview on how it works?
[17:43] <[Coke]> The readmes in each repo don't have any details.
[17:43] <[Coke]> Should I be looking in a folder?
[17:44] <[Coke]> https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS/tree/main/docs/design ?
[17:44] <[Coke]> that seems to be leafs of docs, looking for a TOC or something.
[17:47] <japhb> Yeah, that's the place.
[17:47] <japhb> There's an index file.
[17:47] <japhb> In the design dir.
[17:48] <japhb> [Coke]: ^^
[17:51] <[Coke]> ah. you might want to rename it to README or put the others in a folder to highlight which is the index.
[17:56] <[Coke]> ok. skimmed through that folder, it's (not surprisingly) design related, nothing really practical about how to wire up a game.
[17:56] <[Coke]> Guessing I'd have to look at an existing game to figure something out there.
[17:58] <[Coke]> And having skimmed *that*, I'm guessing a sit down with you might be my best bet. :)
[18:00] <japhb> Heh
[18:00] <japhb> OK, I've got some work to do.  :-)
[18:00] <japhb> Thank you for taking the plunge and giving early feedback -- it's much appreciated.
[18:02] <japhb> [Coke]: Do you think it would work to have an index or README file at the top level of docs/?

[18:16] <japhb> Rebooting, BRB
[18:16] *** japhb left
[18:21] <[Coke]> Yes. That would be helpful. Then you could link to the index from there.
[18:23] *** japhb joined
[18:23] <japhb> BAK.
[18:23] <japhb> Well, that was exciting.  First reboot left me without a network device.  :-P
[18:33] <[Coke]> resend since I don't know if your client is smart: Yes. That would be helpful. Then you could link to the index from there.
[19:04] <japhb> [Coke]: OK, thank you.
