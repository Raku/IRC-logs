[22:29] <[Coke]> install of MUGS very slow/hanging
[22:30] <[Coke]> ===> Extraction [OK]: OpenSSL to /Volumes/BUKKIT/Users/coke/.zef/store/openssl.git is the last thing --verbose install prints out, then it's just chugging
[22:34] <japhb> That's rather odd.
[22:34] <japhb> How did you install it?  `zef install MUGS`?  And on which OS?
[22:45] <[Coke]> aaaaand segfault
[22:46] <[Coke]> zef install --verbose MUGS; rakudo v2021.04
[22:46] <[Coke]> trying deps to see i I can narrow it down. I haven't done anything with mugs since I installed an earlier version
[22:50] <[Coke]> also, mac osx10.15.7
[22:58] <japhb> OK, don't have too much experience with MacOS problems.  I do know that crypt tends to be one of the finickiest things to get installed properly even on Linux.  :-(
[23:13] <japhb> lizmat: Aren't you also on MacOS?  Can you recreate the problem [Coke] is having?
