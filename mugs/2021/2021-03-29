[08:06] <jjatria> japhb: I'm definitely open to PRs, at the very least it's easier to talk about stuff like this with something on the table :)
[08:07] <jjatria> I did think a little about external input supplies, etc, particularly when looking at those raku AI videos. But I figured I could cross that bridge when I got to it. Maybe the bridge is upon us?
[08:09] <jjatria> One more thing: would it make sense to have a more general raku-gamedev channel? I wouldn't want to feel like I'm squatting on MUGS :P

[15:49] <japhb> "raku AI videos"?
[15:50] <japhb> I'm happy to have a #raku-gamedev channel, it just needs to be approved by one of the #raku owners (Freenode has namespacing, so #raku owns all of #raku-* too).  I'd keep this channel as well of course, so I'd just be in both.  :-)

[15:51] <jjatria> Not much there yet, but at least an expression of intent
[15:53] <jjatria> Huh, interesting to hear about that namespacing thing. I didn't know it was a thing, and now I wonder what that means for #raku-land :P
[15:54] <japhb> Squatting a channel is always possible, but the approval part allows you to get ChanServ help in holding it up as a permanent channel.
[15:55] <japhb> And also without the approval, a namespace owner can have a squatting channel removed.
[15:55] <japhb> (This is all just my understanding, I'm not a Freenode IRC Op -- I just got a speech when I registered #mugs.)
[20:01] <japhb> jjatria, lizmat: It sounds like from the conversation following https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/raku-dev?date=2021-03-29#l70 that general feeling was to just create the channel, and then figure out the ChanServ stuff afterwards, so I've done that now ... #raku-gamedev is now a thing.  :-)
[20:02] <japhb> This channel will of course remain for folks who want to talk about the MUGS part of that bigger picture.  :-)
[23:01] <jjatria> Woo! Excellent news. japhb++
