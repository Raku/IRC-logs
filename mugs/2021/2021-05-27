[10:35] <lizmat> logs until 18 May are now accessible at https://logs.liz.nl/mugs/index.html
[16:09] *** lizmat left
[16:23] *** lizmat joined
[16:26] *** LizBot joined
[18:22] <@japhb> Thanks lizmat!
[18:22] <@japhb> ... and now I can see that I lost the first letter of the topic accidentally, oops.  :-P
[18:23] *** japhb changes topic to: Welcome to MUGS ‚öÑ‚ô†‚ôûüèπ (Multi-User Gaming Services)! | https://github.com/Raku-MUGS | This channel is logged for historical purposes; logs at https://logs.liz.nl/mugs/index.html | v0.1.2 has been released! (https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS/blob/main/docs/announce/v0.1.2.md)
[18:24] <@japhb> lizmat: Idea for logs display system: Make 'index.html' optional, so https://logs.liz.nl/mugs/ will work (or even without the final '/' too)
[19:57] <lizmat> hmmm. I thought it already did
[19:57] <lizmat> lemme check
[19:59] <lizmat> https://logs.liz.nl/mugs  works
[19:59] <lizmat> https://logs.liz.nl/mugs/  does not .... hhmmm
[19:59] <@japhb> Ah, I tried the second one first
[20:00] <lizmat> shouldn't this route be enough?
[20:00] <lizmat>             get -> CHANNEL $channel {
[20:00] <lizmat>                 redirect "/$channel/index.html", :permanent
[20:00] <lizmat>             }
[20:01] <@japhb> Maybe you need a `get -> CHANNEL $channel, '' {` as well?
[20:01] <lizmat> hmmmm lemme try
[20:03] <lizmat> apparently, ok, should be in the next "release", today or tomorrow
[20:04] <@japhb> :-)
[20:05] <lizmat> feels like a buglet to me
[22:54] <@japhb> Hmmm.  They *are* technically different URLs, but at the same time it feels like the most common case is that people are going to want that to Just Work.
