[01:20] <japhb> patrickb: This brings github (and zef/fez) up with the latest releasable bits of Terminal-Widgets.

[01:21] <japhb> There are now two branches: 0.0.13 is the tip of the v0.0 branch, just containing some bug fixes without API changes.

[01:22] <japhb> The main branch is now at 0.1.0, because I needed to fix the broken widget refresh API from the 0.0 series.
