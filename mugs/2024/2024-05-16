[21:55] <patrickb> Just to prevent duplicate work: I'm currently implementing a RichText widget (basically a glorified SpanBuffer, including optional wrapping, click events that resolve to the clicked line, optional highlighting of the selected line).

[21:55] <patrickb> After that I'll tackle a TreeView widget.

[23:45] <japhb> Oh excellent, those were on my lists anyway.

[23:45] <japhb> Thank you for letting me know you're working on them patrickb !
