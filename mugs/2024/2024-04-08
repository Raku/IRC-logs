[16:34] <greenfork> Hi, is the concept of Free-as-in-speech explained somewhere? I don't understand how games can be free-as-in-speech. It is in the description of MUGS::Games https://raku.land/zef:japhb/MUGS::Games

[17:58] <japhb> greenfork: In English the word "free" has multiple wildly different meanings, which in other languages often get different words.  When it comes to software, the two most common meanings of "free" are "no purchase cost" (also called "free-as-in-beer" because a party with alcohol served often has "free beer"),

[18:00] <japhb> and "available for public use and discourse" (also called "free-as-in-speech", because source code is considered a form of artistic expression, which in 

[18:01] <japhb> (US) constituional law is refered to as "speech".  "Free speech", the ability to discuss and create for the public, is guaranteed by the First Amendment to the US constitution, and by similar documents worldwide.

[18:02] <japhb> Thus "free-as-in-speech" means "This software is free in the sense that public art and discourse is considered free"

[18:03] <greenfork> I see I see. Is this similar to Richard Stallman's "free as in freedom", "libre"?

[18:03] <japhb> (It happens that free-as-in-speech often implies free-as-in-beer, but the reverse is not true.)

[18:04] <japhb> Yes, "libre" is the French term for "freedom" as opposed to "no cost"

[18:04] <japhb> (I can't remember the French for "no cost" though IIRC the latin is "gratis")

[18:05] <greenfork> "by similar documents worldwide" is a bit of a stretch :^)

[18:05] <japhb> Why do you say that?  Oh did you think I meant "everywhere"?  I meant "in various places around the globe".

[18:06] <greenfork> I see "free-as-in-speech" for the first time, thank you for educating me

[18:06] <japhb> Yet another wonderful confusion of meanings in "worldwide" I guess.

[18:06] <japhb> Of course!

[18:06] <greenfork> Yes, I thought you meant everywhere :^)

[18:09] <japhb> Oh, and: Welcome!  Let me know if you have any other questions about MUGS or the Terminal::* family of modules (most of which I either wrote or collaborated on).

[18:10] <greenfork> I'm trying to install MUGS, so far I patched Crypt-SodiumPasswordHash to accept newer version of libsodium, 26, and currently having the error with Cro::CBOR https://github.com/japhb/Cro-CBOR/issues/1

[18:10] <greenfork> Thank you, I want to try out MUGS and see what this is and how it works

[18:14] <japhb> Looking at the Cro::CBOR issue now

[18:20] <japhb> Responded.

[18:35] <Geth> ¦ Cro-CBOR/main: review: https://github.com/japhb/Cro-CBOR/commit/0ca1633059

[18:36] <japhb> OK, that commit ^^ makes the change in the repo.  Now to see if it will let me push to fez without regenerating the certs ....

[18:36] <greenfork> Thank you, I'm trying install it but zef works unrelaibly, I get frozen `===> Searching for: MUGS` when I try to install MUGS. Is it expected? I'm trying to restart it every 5 minutes or so

[18:36] <japhb> That's really odd, actually.  Are you having network issues?  (If not, perhaps zef is.)

[18:36] <japhb> You can also try doing `zef update` to force it to update to the latest package index as a separate step.

[18:36] <greenfork> I have bad network connection, yes. But this chat and youtube work fine

[18:37] <japhb> IRC: Hardy like a beetle.

[18:38] <greenfork> Now started, will wait for the installation crossing fingers

[18:42] <japhb> :+1:

[18:48] <japhb> Gah, mi6 doesn't want to release something with a broken xt/ test ... which is correct for default behavior, but I'd sure like to override it.

[18:50] <Geth> ¦ Cro-CBOR: japhb self-assigned Tests fail: certificate has expired. Are there scripts for generating the certificates? https://github.com/japhb/Cro-CBOR/issues/1

[18:56] <greenfork> Aborting due to test failure: Red:ver<0.1.70>:auth<zef:FCO>:api<2>

[18:57] <greenfork> So far no luck, I will move on to Red and try to fix it

[19:14] <japhb> Good lord, it seems the world has tended a bit stronger towards entropy than I expected.

[20:04] <greenfork> Got it working! Red appeared to have a single test failing, I ignored it

[20:05] <japhb> :+1:

[20:18] <greenfork> What is the state of MUGS currently? For example, this issue https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS/issues/2

[20:18] <greenfork> Am I supposed to fix this stuff myself?

[20:19] <greenfork> I mean, do I expect everything to break and this is normal

[20:28] <japhb> GAH, at first glance that new issue looks like a subtle change in Red semantics

[20:29] <japhb> I'll have to track that down now, bah.

[20:30] <japhb> As for expectations, the problem here is that I've been hip deep in Terminal-Widgets and MUGS-UI-TUI for months now, and haven't had a lot of opportunities to look at everything else with fresh eyes.

[20:30] <japhb> So yeah, a little bitrot expected, but definitely everything you're having problem with "shouldn't" be a problem, so please keep feeding those issues, and I'll keep knocking them down

[20:33] <japhb> Speaking of which, just completed and closed https://github.com/japhb/Cro-CBOR/issues/1

[20:48] <greenfork> Alright, thank you! I will try to unconver your vision with MUGS while feeding issues

[20:48] <greenfork> I missed that script to generate certificates, great!
