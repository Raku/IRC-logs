[09:25] <patrickb> japhb: I'm slowly approaching the point where I'm going to be blocked on T-W #11 - #18. I'm pretty sure it'll be a few more weeks / months before I reach that point.

[09:26] <patrickb> I heard you're pretty busy moving houses. Obviously the real life always has precedence.

[09:27] <patrickb> But I think it's fair telling you early.

[09:28] <patrickb> Also I'm willing to work on some of the open issues. But most of them are design and architecture territory and I think those are best left to you, given T-W is your brainchild

[15:07] <japhb> patrickb: OK, thank you for letting me know!  I'll see what I can do for you once we're in place in the new house.

[15:12] <patrickb> Thanks!
