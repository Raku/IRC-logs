[09:41] <greenfork> japhb: Could you comment on the use of := operator, I see it sprinkled in some places, e.g. here https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS-Games/blob/main/lib/MUGS/Server/Game/Adventure.rakumod#L217

[09:42] <greenfork> Is this to just avoid containerization-decontainerization overhead for a little bit of performance?

[09:47] <lizmat> yes, that's basically the reason for using :=

[09:48] <lizmat> greenfork: in the case of %has := foo   it also means that "foo" is returning a hash

[09:48] <lizmat> using := in that case means preventing a (relatively slow) copying of the hash

[09:49] <greenfork> Got it, thank you
