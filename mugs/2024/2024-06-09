[20:33] <Geth> ¦ Terminal-Widgets: patrickbkr++ created pull request #21: Patrickb span fixes

[20:33] <Geth> ¦ Terminal-Widgets: review: https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-Widgets/pull/21

[22:02] <patrickb> Progress update: The RichText widget is mostly done. It has an optional cursor, optional highlightable line, optional line and word wrapping. Next is cleaning up the code a bit and then start on the TreeView widget.

[22:05] <japhb> Wowza.  Clearly I need to make some Raku time available.

[22:05] <japhb> Thank you for the update, patrickb !
