[21:42] <patrickb> That's the WIP terminal emulator. CLI stuff mostly works, vim and tmux don't look terrible.

[21:43] <patrickb> Depends on unmerged patches in MoarVM, rakudo, Terminal-ANSIParser. So not yet the best time to try it out.

[21:43] <patrickb> Oh, there also a Terminal-Widgets TerminalEmulator.rakumod widget.

[21:45] <patrickb> Next immediate todos: Implement changing the PTY window size and making it work on Windows, MacOS, OpenBSD.
