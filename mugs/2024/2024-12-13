[11:01] <patrickb> I'm trying to put termios behind an API. The tcsetattr() function takes an arg of when to put the changes into effect. NOW, DRAIN and FLUSH. I wonder if I need to forward these options in my API. That's kind of strange, since on Windows there is no way to influence the point changes go into effect.

[11:02] <patrickb> I'm now looking for opinions if I can just hard code a value and not expose this option. (Which?)

[11:25] <lizmat> make it a noop on Windows ?

[12:29] <patrickb> That's what I currently do. But just maybe only one of those option makes sense in this context. Then I could simplify the API.

[13:15] <lizmat> I'm not sure what the options, fwiw  :-)

[13:15] <lizmat> *do
