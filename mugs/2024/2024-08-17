[21:44] <Geth> ¦ Terminal-Widgets: review: https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-Widgets/pull/22

[21:48] <patrickb> Next bit of progress: I have a tree view implementation ready. Will probably need some polishing, but it works. I'll now proceed with my debugger project for now. (Make use of the TreeView in the Thread and Locals views and RichText in Source, then create a basic syntax highlighter in and for Raku).
