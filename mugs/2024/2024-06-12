[22:01] <patrickb> To anyone interested: Now the RichText widget is completely done. There is an example show-casing the features in examples/rich-text.raku. It lives here: https://github.com/patrickbkr/Terminal-Widgets/tree/patrickb-add-rich-text.

[22:02] * patrickb is proud.

[22:02] <patrickb> Now on to the TreeView.

[22:12] <[Coke]> patrickb: sorry to mention, it seems to render the screen on mac and then explode. You want the trace somewhere?

[22:30] <japhb> .oO( Why does GitHub insist on extra leading in monospaced sections?  Darn ASCII art ruiners .... )

[22:30] <japhb> Thank you patrickb !

[22:30] <japhb> (And [Coke] for bringing up that problem)

[22:31] <japhb> [Coke]: Do any of the other example scripts break?

[22:33] <[Coke]> checking

[22:34] <[Coke]> the half I've tried so far.

[22:34] <[Coke]> ... all of them

[23:25] <japhb> All break, or all work?

[23:26] <japhb> (It sounds like all break, just want to be sure)
