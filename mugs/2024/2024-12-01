[16:22] <timo> is Terminal::LineEditor the right spot to also implement something like a completions menu? or should there merely be an interface that lets the line editor cooperate with a bit of code that renders a menu or "popup" above or below the line?

[17:40] <patrickb> Maybe we could have both, a nice interface to plug something like that into and am impl of that same interface. Then it can be nicely used standalone, but also allow e.g. T-W a custom implementation that matches the rest of the T-W stack.
