[07:03] <patrickb> [Coke], japhb: That issue that coke observes is some native lib issue with the only native dep in the T-W stack (termios). From what I remember, T-W does not use any feature from termios that requires the native dep. It's on my list to create a termios::pureraku or some such that has all the features T-W needs but doesn't have a C component.

[07:04] <patrickb> Irrespective of that, it should still have worked.

[14:58] <[Coke]> japhb: yes, all of them break
