[22:21] <japhb> Woah, patrickb , thanks for filing all the T-W issues!

[22:22] <japhb> Looks like I need to throw some significant tuits that direction ...

[23:13] <japhb> patrickb: I've looked through your issues, and they all look good.  Do you have any particular prioritization on those?

[23:13] <japhb> In other words, what's your biggest blocker?
