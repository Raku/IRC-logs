[18:26] <greenfork> How do I start developing a new game, what are my very first actions? I want it to appear in the list of all games for a CLI UI

[18:27] <greenfork> And what would be the best setup if I would like to also fix any bugs I encounter in the MUGS repositories

[21:29] * japhb looks at https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS/tree/main/docs/howto

[21:29] <japhb> Well shoot, it looks like there's a lot of stubbing in there.  :-(

[21:32] <japhb> There's a tool for creating the skeleton for new games, genres, and UIs in MUGS-Core: https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS-Core/blob/main/lib/MUGS/App/DevTool.rakumod is the implementation (bin/mugs-tool is the script that launches it)

[21:33] <japhb> On my local system, within my main FOSS project tree, I have a directory MUGS which contains subdirectories from cloning each repo in the MUGS org.

[21:34] <japhb> Generally speaking, you'll want to have consistent versions between MUGS-Core, MUGS-Games, and any MUGS-UI-* that you want to work on.

[21:35] <japhb> So while I'm working on a single release across all of them, if I need to make a change to the core or the games suite, I make the change in MUGS-Core or MUGS-Games and then `zef install . --force` in each updated directory.

[21:36] <japhb> Oh, I should have said:  Working on anything above MUGS-Core, I don't want to have to specify a metric ton of include directories, so I just have them `zef install`ed into my Rakudo build, so at most the only `-I` flag I need to use is for the top level UI repo I'm working on.

[21:37] <japhb> All games need a Server, a Client, and one or more UIs.

[21:38] <japhb> Games can share common bits in two ways: By using Genres (which can cascade), or using the Common directory (for data that both Server and Client care about but that is wasted to send over the wire -- like for instance the list of cards in a standard deck).

[21:40] <japhb> Let me know if that helps, or if you still have questions after looking at that stuff.

[21:40] <japhb> (Don't be surprised if you do, the fact that I didn't complete the how to guides last time I was in there means there's still a lot locked in my head.  :-P )
