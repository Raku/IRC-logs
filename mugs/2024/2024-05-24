[06:48] <patrickb> Hey! None of those issues is a real blocker, as there are so many open ends I need to follow. So it will be some time before I'm actually blocked. Giving them a priority, I'd saydynamically hiding / showing widgets 

[06:49] <patrickb> 1. DOM like API (some way to dynamically show / hide widgets)

[06:49] <patrickb> 2. Popovers

[06:52] <patrickb> 3. Custom widgets (i.e. how do I create a widget in third party code)

[07:01] <Geth> ¦ Terminal-Widgets: patrickbkr++ created pull request #19: Two small fixes
