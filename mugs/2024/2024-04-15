[04:22] <japhb> Thanks for replying, lizmat!  I've been mostly AFK today ....

[17:44] <greenfork> I have a primitive game for starters, now I'd like to reap the benefits of testability, since it is not dependable on UI

[17:44] <greenfork> I assume I want to set up a Client-Server integration testing somehow?

[17:45] <greenfork> I already can test smaller components, but Client/UI/Server split is not necessary for unit tests

[17:46] <greenfork> I also kind of lack the concept of where the game starts, I think testing should help with that too. How would I start?
