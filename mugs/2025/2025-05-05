[20:54] <timo> the Changes document of Terminal::Print is missing some entries it seems like?

[22:22] <japhb> timo: I wouldn't be surprised.  Might be worth going back and putting them in retroactively I suppose.

[22:22] <timo> and Terminal::API suffers from raku.land not rendering README.rakudoc :(

[22:23] <japhb> Also, for the record, I hate flakey net connections.  I was lucky to see that you'd written anything what with the storm of reconnection messages in my scrollback ...  :-P

[22:23] <timo> oh sorry i have that weechat filter that filters those out so i didn't even notice

[22:24] <japhb> Well shoot, that's annoying.  I mean, I'm used to having a README.md because GitHub, but it kinda sucks that raku.land doesn't support both yet.

[22:24] <timo> right. i think mi6 can handle markdowning your readme from pod i think?

[22:25] <japhb> At least I'm not seeing *people* connecting and dropping, only the channels and server connection.  Still, if it happens enough times ....

[22:25] <japhb> timo: Yeah, it does, and that's what I generally use.
