[09:19] <japhb> MERGED!

[09:20] <japhb> patrickb: ^^

[09:28] <japhb> That let me close all the open PRs and several open issues.

[09:28] <japhb> \o/

[09:31] <japhb> The next big thing is merging the SpanStyle and TextContent models.  SpanStyle is simpler (both in implementation and use) and supports the lines() method in appropriate places.  TextContent is massively more conceptually complete, including supporting translations, interpolated spans, parseable markup, etc.

[09:32] <japhb> I suspect I'll be pushing the SpanStyle extras into TextContent, and then switching over to that entirely (maybe with some back compat wrapping if needed).

[09:43] <japhb> I'll do a release tomorrow probably, just so we can have this moment preserved in fez.  ;-)

[09:43] <japhb> Night y'all!

[21:21] <japhb> patrickb: And there's the release ^^

[21:27] <patrickb> Nice!

[21:28] <patrickb> Did you manage to track down the at most 6 wrapped lines bug?

[21:34] <japhb> I hadn't actually gone deep on your big 3 -- SpanWrappingAndHighlighting, RichText, and TreeView.  Once I got all the examples/ working again, and some immediate cleanups dealt with, I figured merge was go.

[21:35] <japhb> I'll be working more on all this, but you deserved a release with all your hard work in it.  Besides, no you can require it in your debugger's META6. :-)

[22:26] <patrickb> Yay! 😀

[22:27] <patrickb> But a teeny bit more yak shaving aka getting zef working on Windows reliably first. *Then* it's back to the debugger.

[22:38] <japhb> Good thinking.  :-)

[23:13] <patrickb> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/6024

[23:13] <patrickb> there you go 😀

[23:25] <japhb> Thank you!  Let me get the OK from [Coke] and then I can merge.

[23:39] <japhb> 6024 merged!  New MSI?

[23:39] <japhb> (For testing, I mean.)
