[22:24] <wayland> Hi!  Was cruising through on the web, and saw the docs discussion.  One of my projects ( https://raku.land/zef:wayland/TOP ) is documented with RakuDoc, but I have a step in my build process where I convert all docs to Markdown, Text, and HTML.  

[22:25] <wayland> A replacement for Mi6 is about 3rd on my list; need to get Tree-Oriented Programming done first.  

[22:38] <lizmat> OOC, what's wrong with App::Mi6 ?

[22:38] <lizmat> that it needs a replacement?

[22:44] <wayland> lizmat: Only that we have about 6 bits of software that assist with the process of making modules and they all have what I regard as overlapping-but-incomplete feature sets.  I only mentioned Mi6 because it had already been mentioned.  

[22:45] <lizmat> do you think the design of App::Mi6 prohibits all the features you'd like to see added ?

[22:45] <wayland> Dropping out of this channel; I'll be in #raku if people want me :)
