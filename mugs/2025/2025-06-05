[14:51] <lizmat> Distro.new(release => "24F74", path-sep => ":", name => "macos", auth => "Apple Inc.", version => v15.5, signature => Blob, desc => "Sequoia")

[14:55] <japhb> Wait, LizyPro is running 15.5 now?  Now why does the screenshot look like the old one I had from 10.14 ... hmmm, there must be something else different.  Different font chosen for the terminal maybe?

[14:59] <lizmat> I guess I didn't bother to change my machine name moving to the new MBP

[15:04] <japhb> Fair enough.  I'm just confused why it still *looks* like an old version of the Terminal.  For comparison the 12.6 screenshot you'd sent me from M1Mini looked a lot better than *either* of the LizyPro images (either when it was 10.14 or now at 15.5)

[15:04] <japhb> So the question becomes: What's different about M1Mini's terminal config?

[15:12] <lizmat> because I'm going through VLC to that macmini ?

[15:13] <japhb> VLC?  Is that related to the media player, or something different?

[15:14] <japhb> Or did you mean VNC?

[15:14] <lizmat> yeah, duh  :-)

[15:15] <japhb> .oO( Geez guys, do you suppose your project names could be *slightly* easier to confuse?  Asking for a friend. )

[15:16] <japhb> OK, so you use VNC to get into the M1Mini ... but wouldn't that show you exactly what *would* be displayed locally on the M1Mini if it had its own monitor?

[15:27] <lizmat> you would think so, yes

[15:27] <lizmat> hmmm...

[15:28] <lizmat> except that the MacMini is still running Sonoma

[15:34] <lizmat> japhb: what installs terminal-autodetect again ?

[15:49] <japhb> Terminal::Capabilities

[15:53] <lizmat> that's sonoma on the macmini

[16:15] <japhb> WTA?

[16:15] <japhb> That makes no sense, and I'm grumbly about it
