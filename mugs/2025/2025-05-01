[02:19] <japhb> If only timo!  :-D

[02:20] <japhb> OK, too much else going on in RL right now ... what do you need me to do patrickb ?

[05:48] <patrickb> japhb: bump versions in T-P. I can make a PR in the evening.

[06:09] *** japhb left
[06:09] *** japhb joined
[14:26] <japhb> patrickb: Roger that.

[20:53] <patrickb> I've now created the PR. CI still fails though. Bummer. This time it's MacOS. In T-API 1.0.2 I call tput just as T-P did. Still the call errors on MacOS with "tput: No value for $TERM and no -T specified". I'm wondering, why that error now shows up but it presumably worked when calling tput directly from T-P.

[20:54] <ab5tract> I'm not sure how advanced our test infra has been in T-P, so I could imagine this didn't surface because of lack of coverage

[20:55] <patrickb> Looking at the CI history, it even succeeded on MacOS in the latest commit to master. That commit already has the relevant MacOS changes. I'm confused.

[20:55] <ab5tract> :S

[20:59] <patrickb> Oh, I see. That error is a red hering. The same tput error is present in the succeeding CI runs as well. The error has a different cause.

[21:13] <patrickb> I've tried my hand on a fix. We'll see what CI says. But I'm off to bed for tonight.

[21:16] <patrickb> MacOS Passes now, but Windows is still behaving strangely on the CI (locally the tests pass on Windows though).

[23:19] <japhb> Yeah, just got back to my desk and saw that.  I'm a little weirded out that the test passes in Windows locally and fails in Windows CI ... though I'm beginning to think T-P is at the focal point for stupid OS incompatibilities.

[23:20] <japhb> Re-running CI just in case it's some odd flapper

[23:27] <japhb> MoarVM panic: Memory allocation failed; could not allocate 1926864 bytes

[23:27] <japhb> Error: Process completed with exit code 1.

[23:27] <japhb> Well *that* seems a bit suboptimal
