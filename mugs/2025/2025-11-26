[08:20] <Geth> ¦ Terminal-Widgets/main: 0.2.3

[08:20] <Geth> ¦ Terminal-Widgets/main: review: https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-Widgets/commit/87870b6f0e

[08:22] <japhb> patrickb: There's a reasonable chance that 0.2.3 will be the last 0.2.x (and if it's not, I don't expect more than one more).  I'll bump to 0.3.x when I start deleting stuff.

[08:27] <japhb> patrickb: Do you use SpanStyle::Span.words anywhere?  It doesn't appear to be used anywhere in T::W at the moment.

[08:27] <patrickb> Pretty sure I don't.

[08:28] <patrickb> Pretty impressive progress!

[08:29] <patrickb> The debugger at the moment doesn't use RichText or TreeView anywhere yet.

[08:29] <patrickb> So there is no need to hold back nuking them.

[08:30] <patrickb> I'd prefer directly going for the rework instead of doing it with the legacy impls only to rework it right after.

[08:33] <patrickb> I think I can resume work on the debugger pretty soon as I believe I have all external dependencies in place (pty, var-args, DirsOfInterest). I promoted getting rakudo/rakudo#5060 merged to the top of my list. But once that's in, I'll go for the debugger.

[09:24] <japhb> patrickb: OK, roger that.  I'm only holding back nuking them because you wanted me to get to feature parity first, and I'm still a little shy of that.  :-)

[09:25] <japhb> I'm going to have to do a bit more to clean up some visual artifacts in MUGS-UI-TUI, but the above commits at least get it starting up and not immediately exploding when you select a main menu item.  :-P

[09:26] <patrickb> That feature parity request was out of fear of the new impl not reaching feature parity ever. As long as we get there at some point - go ahead!

[09:26] <japhb> :-D

[09:27] <japhb> patrickb: If you haven't already, try the dir-tree example, and let me know if you want me to tweak anything there *other* than line wrapping

[09:28] <patrickb> tweaking as in more features or as in bugs?

[09:28] <japhb> Huh.  Either I guess?  I don't know of any bugs in there at the moment.

[09:29] <japhb> (But the implementor is always blind.  ;-) )

[09:29] <patrickb> 👍🏼

[09:29] <japhb> Dang it, I need to put my IRC client under Ghostty.  I'm tired of skin tones not working right.  >:-|

[09:32] <japhb> You know, of all the fixes I've done in the last couple weeks, having keyboard-accessible scrollbars is still my favorite.

[09:35] <patrickb> the example is pretty nice!

[09:35] <japhb> Excellent.  :-)

[09:35] <patrickb> Is it possible to differentiate clicking on the arrows and the rest of the line?

[09:35] <japhb> Differentiate in what way?

[09:36] <japhb> (Scrollbar arrowhead clicks are actually handled specially, so I wonder what you mean)

[09:36] <patrickb> I wouldn't necessarily want this in this case. But clicking on the arrow expands / collapses, clicking on the text does the contextual action (in this case print to the log)

[09:37] <patrickb> So I only want the log, but don't want to collapse the folder. That's currently not possible.

[09:37] <japhb> OH!  I see what you mean, I was still stuck on scrollbars.

[09:37] <japhb> Yeah, that seems reasonable.

[09:38] <japhb> Also might be worth checking standard key bindings against a real-world file manager

[09:38] <patrickb> Is it technically possible to get the scroll wheel going?

[09:39] <japhb> Hmmm.  I don't actually know what that looks like as raw input.  I'll add that to the list to check it out. 

[09:39] <patrickb> That's the intuitive first thing I tried - scrolling. :-P

[09:40] <japhb> Damn your reasonable expectations!  ;-)

[09:40] <patrickb> Persistence of expanded state is also missing.

[09:41] <patrickb> I.e. expand a few things, collapse the top level node and expand again. Should be as before.

[09:42] <patrickb> Ideally this should work even with the underlying tree changing it's shape.

[09:42] <japhb> Good point.  I'd held off on that for performance reasons, but at this point I've probably got things good enough to hold that state around and not slow down.

[09:42] <patrickb> (That's the case for the locals view in the debugger for which I want to use the tree view.)

[09:43] <japhb> Yeah, decent point

[09:44] <japhb> That's part of the functionality I wanted to work towards with the whole Volatile/ directory, but that's mostly just barely enough to support the current demo.

[09:45] <japhb> It'll get there.

[09:46] <patrickb> Don't take my comments as critique. I'm pretty impressed how things are turning out and I fully understand that the process is not at it's end yet. :-)

[09:46] <japhb> I hadn't!  I was taking it as constructive feedback.  :-)

[09:49] <patrickb> the legacy tree view had this duality thing.

[09:49] <japhb> ?

[09:50] <patrickb> so either provide a callback that returns the children for a node on demand - that's how the new tree view works, right?

[09:50] <japhb> yep

[09:51] <patrickb> Alternatively one could pass a static tree of nodes instead. The TreeView would put a wrapper around to make it adhere to the dynamic interface.

[09:53] <japhb> I might just provide a wrapper in Volatile/Tree for that, so Viewer/Tree always sees the dynamic interface.  But yeah, same idea.

[09:53] <patrickb> That's not a hard requirement (actually I think I don't even need that for the debugger), but it's easier to wrap one's head around, so might be a nice addition to get people going.

[09:54] <japhb> Yeah, agreed.

[09:55] <patrickb> I recall during my studies how I really struggled with that dynamic tree thing in Qt and was really glad I could just stick together a tree structure and pass that in.

[09:55] <japhb> Yeah, totally fair.  I've been trying to put back some affordances (like span-tree() being able to accept plain Str children) that I had initially lost in all the refactoring.

[09:56] <japhb> A static tree is good for that.
