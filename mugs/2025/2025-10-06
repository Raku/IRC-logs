[05:10] <japhb> ^^ Working on autodetecting more terminal types

[05:12] <patrickb> It's nice to see progress. Thanks japhb!

[05:19] <japhb> patrickb: I'm working my way through the Terminal::* stack trying to fix things up where I can

[05:19] <japhb> (Where 'can' is limited by my head cold at the moment.  :-P )

[05:20] <japhb> I'm trying to release the Terminal-Print version with all your changes, but either fez or mi6 is breaking there.  :-(

[05:21] <patrickb> Yeah, I've seen your notes over on #raku

[05:22] <japhb> Which reminds me, I ought to point Terminal-Print at Geth here.

[05:24] <japhb> ab5tract: Can you either point Terminal-Print's commit hook at the Geth in #mugs, or give me whatever extra rights I need in order to edit the repo settings?

[05:24] <patrickb> I'm still working on var-arg support in NativeCall. It's kinda involved, but it seems I'm slowly getting there. (Since live is pretty busy (in a positive way) at the moment, I'm working on a stronger than usual limited time budget atm)

[05:25] <japhb> TOTALLY GET THAT.

[05:25] <japhb> Had to spend two weeks (!) on an extended job application.  31 pages just to *outline* my answers to the essay questions in the application.

[05:26] <patrickb> What? That's insane!

[05:26] <japhb> Yes.  Yes it is.

[05:28] <japhb> After I submitted the essay responses, they gave me an IQ test.  I'm not sure what in "I answered your enormous essay question pack" indicates I have a low IQ, or that they will learn more from an IQ test, but ....  :shrug:

[05:30] <japhb> Does make me wonder how many other folks have been willing to get this far though ....

[05:30] <patrickb> Also strange because someone will have to read through all of this...

[05:31] <patrickb> Wait. Are they feeding all of this to an AI?

[05:32] <patrickb> I would have guessed that with your seniority employers would and should simply go by previous work experience.

[05:32] <japhb> If they are, I think it would make for a pretty odd chatbot ....

[05:33] <japhb> One would think.  Then again, a couple of the essay questions asked about high school, and then there was a FAQ entry in which they said "We ask everyone this!  It has nothing to do with role seniority!"

[05:33] <patrickb> I more thought of some HR AI that eats all of the responses and then spits out Yay or Nay.

[05:33] <japhb> If it's a FAQ, maybe ... reconsider?

[05:34] <japhb> Oh dude, if they kick me out before I even get to speak to a real human, I will be ... upset.

[05:34] <patrickb> But offloading hiring work on the applicants like this is morally wrong I'd say.

[05:35] <patrickb> This is kind of funny reading on IRC but I can totally relate how annoying it must be.

[05:43] <japhb> NOD

[05:49] <patrickb> Me is off to work. Third day...

[05:50] <patrickb> o/

[06:28] <japhb> Congrats on new job, and good luck at work!  :-)
