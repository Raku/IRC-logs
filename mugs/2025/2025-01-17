[14:10] <japhb> patrickb: Oh nice!

[14:22] <lizmat> japhb: could you do a release of Terminal::LineEditor, so we can all benefit from non-breakage on MacOS ?  :-

[14:22] <lizmat> )

[14:35] <patrickb> lizmat: Just so I understand. Doesn't `zef install "Terminal-MakeRaw:ver<1.0.1>"` fix the issue?

[14:36] <lizmat> probably

[14:37] <lizmat> it's just that ::LineEditor on zef now has "Terminal::MakeRaw:ver<1.0.0+>" as the dependency

[14:37] <patrickb> I guess it's nice to have the version bumped, just because it's nice, but I don't really see where that actually makes a difference...

[14:38] <lizmat> so if you have that already installed, and you install Terminal::LineEditor

[14:38] <lizmat> you get the broken version

[14:39] <patrickb> Yeah, that's the only case where it'll make a difference. If you have T-LE already installed or T-MR not installed it doesn't make a difference.-

[14:50] <japhb> I can certainly do a release though, not a big deal
