[05:39] <japhb> Welp, didn't expect that.  The bisect finally landed on Rakudo 2025.03-27-:

[05:39] <japhb> 8f8b95866f - Make the :{ } object hash syntax be like my %h{Mu} (9 weeks ago)

[05:41] <japhb> The only place I use object hash syntax is Terminal::Widgets::StandardWidgetBuilder.default-build-nodes ... so pretty good chance that stopped working somehow

[05:42] <japhb> Welp, I think that's enough of slamming my head into a wall for the day.  Time to sleep and pick this up on the morrow.

[06:04] <Xliff> Wow

[07:29] *** timo joined
[07:30] <timo> can i help with the flappiness in rakudo with Terminal::Widgets?

[10:32] <Xliff> timo: Can you help with the flappiness in one of my want-to-be-released projects?

[10:32] <timo> i can try

[10:33] <Xliff> Let me know when you have some free time. Are you going to be around this weekend?

[10:33] <timo> japhb: are you building rakudo versions yourself? do you know about the builds you can get from the whateverable bots?

[10:33] <timo> yes i am around this weekend

[10:33] <Xliff> Other than that, you can install GLib and GIO via zef

[10:33] <Xliff> and then clone https://github.com/p6-JSON-GLib

[10:34] <Xliff> Then: raku -Ilib dev-t/04-variant.t

[10:34] <Xliff> It's been driving me insane.

[10:35] <Xliff> (I hate the fact my stuff takes so long to install...)

[10:36] <timo> is that under the Xliff github user?

[10:36] <Xliff> Yes.

[14:49] <japhb> timo: I am building locally, but the time to build MoarVM/nqp/Rakudo is a small fraction of the total build time, which is dominated by the time to install the dozens of modules and dependencies I'm using.

[14:51] <timo> ah, I see

[14:52] <Xliff> japhb: Looking last night, I found git-dissect

[14:52] <Xliff> https://github.com/talshorer/git-dissect

[15:42] <japhb> Xliff: Interesting, thanks

[21:39] *** Xliff left
[23:05] *** wayland76 left
[23:42] <japhb> Yup, confirmed Rakudo 8f8b95866f broke https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-Widgets/blob/main/lib/Terminal/Widgets/StandardWidgetBuilder.rakumod

[23:43] <japhb> Specifically, it made default-build-nodes return something that no longer correctly smart matches on line 42.

[23:44] <japhb> lizmat: Do you know about ^^, and if so what I need to do to get it working correctly again?

[23:47] <japhb> Xliff: Update relevant to your T-W lock up problem ^^
