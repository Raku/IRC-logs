[09:04] <ab5tract> Has everyone heard about the upcoming release from the ghostty folks? 

[09:04] <ab5tract> libghostty-vt, mentioned here: https://mitchellh.com/writing/libghostty-is-coming

[09:58] <patrickb> Oh, that's nice! Thanks for the link. (I'd love to see a Raku lib for this, once it's out. But I guess having a pure Raku term stack will also still have it's merit.)

[10:10] <ab5tract> If nothing else, it may point us ways out of hard edge cases

[13:02] <patrickb> I imagine a world where tools can freely switch from pure raku to libghostty. So just install libghostty and all is perfect. Don't install and you get the pure raku version.

[13:04] <patrickb> So yes, that's absolutely the solution for all cases where you need more than a basic terminal.

[13:07] <patrickb> for full transparency: I have a basic pure raku terminal emulator here: https://sr.ht/~patrickb/Anolis/

[13:07] <patrickb> My plan was to use it in the tui debugger I'm working on.

[13:58] <ab5tract> awesome!
