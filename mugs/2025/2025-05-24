[07:18] <patrickb> No, these are separate projects.

[07:20] <patrickb> I haven't looked at Terminal::UI in detail, but from what I know, I think T-UI has a lot smaller scope, but is usable, while T-W is a lot bigger but not stable yet.

[08:04] <wayland76> They looked to me like they were fairly complementary.  Terminal::UI just basically makes scrollable boxes/windows.  I figured Terminal::Widgets could make use of that.

[18:04] <japhb> patrickb: Thank you for replying to wayland76 - we had a full-day nearly-city-wide internet outage here yesterday.  That many people without access to the internet is a scary thing.  :-P

[18:06] <japhb> Terminal::Widgets had been on a bit of hiatus while I dealt with some RL stuff, but it has been its own stack for a while, building up from the very basics.  There are a lot of things left to do, and I will be taking inspiration from other terminal-related modules, but because of T-W's architecture I can rarely directly use code from them.

[18:08] <japhb> I am working to clear my PR backlog (patrickb's being the bulk of the remainder), so thankfully moving forward these days.

[18:09] <japhb> Sorta like an old locomotive though -- slow chuffing and barely moving wheels until we build up speed again.  ;-)

[18:34] <patrickb> On the same note, I'm still trying to figure out the #19 question. Will take some more time.
