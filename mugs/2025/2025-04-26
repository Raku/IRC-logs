[01:18] <timo> how's the current state in terms of Terminal::LineEditor (or similar) with coloring and other rich text features?

[03:50] <japhb> timo: T::LE doesn't do color of the input text.  (You can color the prompt, but that's a separate thing.)

[03:51] <japhb> timo: T::W does have that capability, but I got interrupted working on that.  patrickb picked up some of it for his debugger work, but I haven't merged his work back yet.

[03:51] <japhb> I have a little more time/energy lately, maybe that's where it should go, hmmmmm.
