[21:48] <japhb> patrickb: Are you around?

[21:48] <patrickb> Yes. Hi there!

[21:50] <japhb> So ... first off, my deep apologies that you haven't gotten much of my time of late.  :-(

[21:51] <japhb> Second: I can't run CI tests for the various PRs because Terminal::API doesn't exist in zef

[21:52] <japhb> patrickb: So ... if you get Terminal::API available, so that I can run CI, I'll start merging PRs.  :-)

[21:53] <patrickb> Cool. I'll happily do so!

[21:54] <patrickb> Also I'm a deep believer of https://drewdevault.com/2021/06/14/Provided-as-is-without-warranty.html

[21:56] <patrickb> So while I do like you being more active, I in no way think that you have to or are somehow required to.

[22:12] <patrickb> Terminal-Print 1.0.0 is now uploaded. It should show up in the ecosystem in the next few hours.

[22:23] <japhb> https://drewdevault.com/2021/06/14/Provided-as-is-without-warranty.html is really eloquent and guilt-reducing, thank you.

[22:24] <japhb> I assume you meant Terminal-API 1.0.0 ... yeah, looks like it's there.

[22:24] <patrickb> Yeah, API I meant.

[22:39] <japhb> OK, after some confusion on my end too, I've merged the T::P PR and it's running CI again post-merge

[22:40] <japhb> Looks like it failed on MacOS ... https://github.com/ab5tract/Terminal-Print/actions/runs/14047378571/job/39331000743

[22:52] <patrickb> Thanks for the pointer. I will have to look into that.

[22:55] <japhb> BTW, I think I did a rebase of the PR in there, while I was trying to figure out how to force GH to rerun the CI without adding a new commit just for that.

[22:55] <japhb> My apologies for that.  (Just because of the confusion it might cause you.)

[22:56] <patrickb> I don't think the rebase is related to the errors. That looks like a bug in T-API itself. Luckily I have access to a MacOS machine. So I have a real chance to fix this.

[22:58] <japhb> :+1:

[22:58] <patrickb> But it's time for me to head for bed. So fixing that is for later...

[22:59] <japhb> OK, sounds good

[22:59] <japhb> Sleep well!

[23:00] <patrickb> o/
