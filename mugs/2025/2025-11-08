[13:49] <patrickb> Rebase done. Found some time unexpectedly.

[13:51] <patrickb> Didn't try the result though. But I think it's possible that it works. There weren't any "real" conflicts, only parts of that branch that got picked to main already.

[17:03] <japhb> Cool, thank you for doing the rebase!  Confirmed working (except that the semantics of "Highlight Selected Line" seem a little weird).

[17:06] <japhb> For the rich-text demo, word wrap seems to just stop after 6 wrapped lines ...?

[17:24] *** librasteve_ left
[20:49] <patrickb> i.e. one line wrapped into 6?

[20:49] <patrickb> that I might have never tried

[20:50] <patrickb> but I definitely saw more than 6 lines in the demo in the past...

[20:50] <patrickb> I'll have a look hopefully soonish

[22:37] <japhb> Line wrap created all the lines, but word wrap stopped after 6 wrapped per base line.  Which meant for example that the second set of smilies didn't appear for the word wrap.

[23:52] <japhb> patrickb: Now that you've got your T-W PRs both rebased onto my main branch, I'm considering either cherry-picking and tweaking as I go, or branching off your PR and making the changes I want before merging to main.

[23:53] <japhb> What do you have that runs on top of your T-W PRs?  I'd like to *either* make sure I don't break your downstream *or* patch it up myself as needed.

[23:54] <japhb> Anyone else in here actively basing something on top of T-W?  There may be some tromping around in the guts coming up.

[23:55] <japhb> Also, on a different topic:

[23:58] <japhb> If anyone in here is rocking MacOS or Windows, I would like to update the related screenshots in https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-Tests/blob/main/README.md now that the terminal-quick-test pattern has been massively improved.

[23:59] <japhb> (The other advantage of sending me fresh screenshots there is that I can examine them and improve the autodetection in Terminal-Capabilities, as long as I have the OS and terminal emulator versions for each screenshot.)
