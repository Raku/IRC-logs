[15:25] <patrickb> japhb: I think you will find the config wizard of the zsh powerlevel10k theme interesting.

[15:27] <patrickb> They display a bunch of chars one after the other always asking if it's rendered correctly. Basically homing in on how exactly the terminal is configured.

[15:33] <patrickb> Sadly I didn't find a good screen recording of the wizard.

[15:51] <japhb> That guy is a bit of a character.  :-D

[15:53] <japhb> Their wizard is interesting.  A bit heavy, but interesting.

[15:53] <japhb> I like how they test for the Debian logo.  :-)

[15:58] <japhb> That's the kind of thing I (so far, at least) can't autodetect: font configuration.  Right now I'm basing the logic for Terminal::Capabilities::Autodetect on the functionality of each terminal type *when the correct fonts are installed*.  But Terminal-Tests includes various visual tests, and I've been working my way toward standardizing that into some configuration widgets for Terminal::Widgets.

[15:59] <japhb> So the defaults will be autodetected as they are now, and then the user can tweak as needed.

[15:59] <japhb> Might be useful to be able to offer advice too, though that might be a whole big thing ...
