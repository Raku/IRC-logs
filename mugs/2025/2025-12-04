[05:20] <Geth> ¦ Terminal-Widgets/main: Reduce waste for most common LocalizedEvent case

[05:20] <Geth> ¦ Terminal-Widgets/main: review: https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-Widgets/commit/6bb05b55c9

[06:25] <Geth> ¦ Terminal-Widgets/main: * If `id` returns a truthy value, the expanded state of the matching

[06:25] <Geth> ¦ Terminal-Widgets/main:   DisplayParent will be remembered, even if its parents are collapsed.

[06:25] <Geth> ¦ Terminal-Widgets/main: * In order to have access to the previously-expanded set, DisplayParents

[06:25] <Geth> ¦ Terminal-Widgets/main:   now know which Viewer::Tree they are part of.
