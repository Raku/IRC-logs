[11:43] <patrickb> Quick note: The only task above the debugger on my to-do list, namely getting #5060 merged turned into a yak hole. I first need to get zef to compile and work with RakuAST before I can finish up that PR.

[11:43] <patrickb> So it'll be a bit longer before I'll continue with the debugger... :-/

[16:53] <japhb> No worries!  I had to take some time off fun coding, but started getting back to it last night.  Hopefully time remains on my side.  :-)

[17:05] <patrickb> If there is any way I can support /encourage you - do tell!

[17:06] * patrickb wonders if there is a practical way to order beer to a us address...
