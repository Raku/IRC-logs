[08:14] <patrickb> I played a bit with the DirTree example. Things I noticed:

[08:15] <patrickb> - When scrolling below the end, it scrolls past the last line. Intuitively I'd have expected the last line to stay on screen (possibly my intuition is wrong here).

[08:16] <patrickb> - It's not possible to open an empty directory with the keyboard. (With a mouse click it works though.)

[08:20] <patrickb> - Keyboard events seem to "pile up". So when keeping the finger on the "down" key, the selection moves downwards. When releasing the button, the selection keeps moving downward for a noticable amount of time. I can imagine this to be difficult to solve, if so this is a pretty low prio issue, so can gladly be ignored for the foreseeable future.

[08:30] <patrickb> - I find the click behavior of the scrollbar unintuitive. It's click only, right? My expectation was for the scroll bar to be drag-n-drop. It took quite a while to realize it's not actually reacting to DND, but only to the click. Possibly DND is actually a bad idea. But maybe it's possible to distinguish clicks from drags and ignore the drags entirely? Then it'd be easier to realize that dragging 

[08:30] <patrickb> is not happening.

[08:33] <patrickb> I think the only sane way for dragging to be implemented is "live dragging" i.e. the scroll happens while moving the mouse, even before the mouse up event.

[16:37] <japhb> You're right, the scrolling past the last line is a bug.  I've put that on my list.

[16:39] <japhb> I'll take a look at the empty directory bug.  That's kinda weird, since I try to keep keyboard and mouse behavior near-equivalent.

[16:41] <japhb> The KB event pile up is probably your key repeat being faster than your redraw rate.  It may help to set the TW_DEBUG env var to some uint > 0 to see refresh timing info.

[16:43] <japhb> The click behavior of the scrollbar itself is known goofy.  Currently a click makes a proportional move depending on where you click it.  That's NOT my long-term intent.  The plan is to split this into two behaviors: 1. Click and drag on the handle to move freely, and 2. Click on the uncovered part of the bar on either side of the handle to move by a screenful that direction.

[16:44] <japhb> The second behavior is already half implemented in the code, but I haven't enabled mouse drag events yet, so haven't got #1.  That's probably got to go on the short list, because the current scrollbar behavior annoys me too.
