[03:47] <japhb> Rollin', rollin', rollin' ...

[03:49] <japhb> patrickb: ^^ I've decided to reframe things like TreeView as Viewer::Tree, as I believe something that interactively *views* (but does not edit or input) a data structure belongs there.

[03:50] <japhb> I'm taking the opportunity to factor out the data structures themselves, which is what the Volatile/ tree is for -- data structures that represent volatile reality so the Viewer/ modules get a clean interface

[03:52] <japhb> For compatibility with your projects, RichText and TreeView will still remain for 0.2.x, but I'll probably take them out of 0.3.x or maybe 0.4.x

[06:31] <patrickb> feel free to take them out right away. I'm totally fine with moving over whenever necessary.

[07:39] <japhb> patrickb: Oh of course.

[07:40] <japhb> As of that last commit, at least the dir-tree example works

[07:42] <patrickb> It's really nice to see all that progress. :-)

[07:58] <japhb> Indeed!  Happy to be making it.  :-)

[09:02] <lizmat> maybe there's an advent post in all of this somewhere  :)

[09:17] <japhb> Oh hmmm, are we short on posts this year?

[09:18] <japhb> (All of my posting energy has been going into LinkedIn of late, so I hadn't been watching advent calendar prep)
