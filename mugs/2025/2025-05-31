[01:00] <japhb> Once again I come to you asking for your help with Terminal-Tests screenshots -- all `terminal-quick-test` screenshots are helpful, but especially if any of you have a Mac, Windows, or BSD box -- please install 0.0.5 and send screenshots with your various terminals.

[01:02] <japhb> I'm also going to be updating Terminal-Capabilities to actually have autodetection support; anyone willing to help with non-Linux terminal info would help fill that out.
