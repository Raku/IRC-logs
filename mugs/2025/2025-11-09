[01:14] <japhb> Back to patrickb++'s T-W PRs ... *reads through commit diffs* ... Whew!  There's a lot there, and it looks like a lot of the commits touch shared lines.  I think cherry-pick-and-tweak is not going to work well, because it will essentially screw the big refactorings and code moves.

[01:15] <japhb> So I think I need to go with the second option: branch off your longest PR and edit like it's 1999.

[06:18] <patrickb> If there is anything I can do to support you here (apart from fixing the 6 lines word wrap issue) do tell,

[06:19] <japhb> Oh don't worry, I'll likely handle that when I go hacking around.

[06:21] <japhb> Right now I'm discovering through the eyes of a friend trying to install my code on Windows that figuring out how to get a proper fully working Rakudo+zef is less than obvious.  :-(

[06:22] <japhb> I feel like some choice edits of rakudo.org's Downloads and Star Bundle pages might make that better

[06:23] * japhb decides whether to add another yak to the shaving stack

[06:40] <japhb> ETOOMANYYAKS

[07:25] <patrickb> re install on Windows being suboptimal. That's right down my alley. If you provide a few hints I'll gladly make the changes.

[07:29] <japhb> \o/

[07:30] <japhb> OK, let me collect my findings, and I'll dump them here

[07:31] <patrickb> 👍🏼

[07:37] <japhb> So I think the first observation is that beginners are getting sent down an intermediate+ path.  https://rakudo.org/downloads  leads people to think the -moar variants are going to work for them, but beginners are going to be lost following online articles/answers if zef is not there.

[07:38] <japhb> Rakudo Star Bundle is confusingly available on that page *only* for scoop and chocolatey, but if you just want the dang MSI, it's over on  https://rakudo.org/star

[07:39] <japhb> And my friend tried the scoop install, found it wasn't setting things up right (PATH not fixed, IIRC), so he went for the MSI, and discovered scoop left some junk around that made the Rakudo installed by the MSI not work.  (Details lost on this bit.)

[07:41] <japhb> Why are we offering both a ZIP and an MSI on the downloads Windows tab, if the ZIP and MSI are the same size?

[07:41] <japhb> The MSI isn't signed, so he had to approve the scary security message.

[07:44] <japhb> Nothing made it obvious that rakudo should be run under a terminal running "Beta UTF-8" AKA CP65001, because the results in a UTF-16 terminal are just garbage

[07:47] <japhb> Based on a screenshot he sent, `scoop install rakudo-moar` *tried* to install zef, but it didn't work, saying "Can't shim 'share\perl6\site\bin\zef.bat': File doesn't exist."

[07:48] <japhb> But `scoop install rakudo-star` *does* install zef (or at least, it claimed to)

[07:50] <japhb> rakudo-star MSI uses C:\ while rakudo-moar MSI uses C:\Program Files

[07:53] <japhb> Once he got `zef install` working at all (the rakudo-moar MSI + some rebooting required, IIRC), it wanted to install scripts to C:\rakudo\share\perl6\site\bin\..\..\..\..\share\perl6\site\bin -- which is just weird (go down 5 dirs, go up 4, go back down the same 4 you just went up)

[07:55] <japhb> OK, I think that was most of the useful findings.  There were a *lot* more details in the impromptu UX test, like exactly *how* to get UTF-8 turned on, but the above should be a decent start

[07:57] <japhb> I'm also going to take some of what we found and add to the Terminal-Tests README and the Terminal-Capabilities autodetection.

[07:57] <japhb> patrickb: ^^

[07:59] <patrickb> thanks!

[07:59] <japhb> Oh let me tell you, you'll be the one getting thanked if all this gets easier!  :-D

[08:00] <patrickb> I'll try to channel the star stuff to the right place an tackle the rest on my own.

[08:00] <japhb> Excellent, thanks!

[08:00] <patrickb> I'm also the one to blame for what we have at the moment...

[08:02] <japhb> That's the problem with experts ... they don't notice the things beginners do.  :-P

[21:21] <patrickb> re "rakudo.org/downloads leads people to think the -moar variants are going to work for them" - they should. Did I understand right that the issue with those was a missing zef? If so, then I need to use even bigger guns. (They do contain a zef. It's just that one needs to include two, not one PATH. This has tripped up people often enough that it's even explained in the very first paragraph on 

[21:21] <patrickb> that page. I think I'll make that one sentence bold.)

[21:26] <patrickb> re "Why are we offering a ZIP and an MSI if they are the same size?" - MSI is an installer that sets everything (including the PATHs) up. Use this unless you know better. The ZIP is simply a zipped up relocatable Rakudo. Suitable for building your own Raku programs on top and distributing them.

[21:32] <patrickb> re "The MSI isn't signed." Yes this sucks big time. I've invested countless hours and more than one and a half years in total trying to get this sorted out with the YAS guys. When we finally got to the point where we were ready to order a cert, the idea of a separate Raku foundation came up and all plans of ordering a Cert via YAS were moot. In the meantime SignPath started offering certs for OSS 

[21:32] <patrickb> for free. So only need to find the time to get it going with them or do it via the to not yet established new Raku Foundation once it exists.

[21:37] <patrickb> re that path with the four updirs. - Do you know where exactly that path showed up?

[22:05] *** wayland left
[22:42] <japhb> We got a screenshot of it if you need, but it was at the end of `zef install Terminal::Tests`, when it installs the terminal-test and terminal-quick-test scripts
