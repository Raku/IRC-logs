[19:06] <patrickb> I've just released Terminal-API v1.0.1. That release works around the Missing native call var-arg support of rakudo. So I believe we could move forward with the Windows support PRs of mine.

[22:37] <japhb> OK, can you regenerate your PR for Terminal-Print?  Double points if you separate the stuff that switches to Terminal-API and the stuff that gets rid of the tput stuff in separate commits.  :-)
