[08:08] <japhb> patrickb: It looks like you created https://github.com/ab5tract/Terminal-Print/pull/90 before Terminal::API 1.0.4 made it to fez; I'm rerunning the checks now

[08:09] <patrickb> nah, it's still not there yet, is it?

[08:09] <japhb> Welp, the rerun blew up in a more interesting way now ....

[08:09] <japhb> It showed up when I checked a minute ago

[08:10] <patrickb> Fine then :-)

[08:12] <patrickb> ugh. That's not the kind of interesting I like

[08:14] <patrickb> I can repro

[08:19] <japhb> Well at least it's reproduceable

[12:42] <patrickb> japhb: https://boekernet.de/~patrick/rakudo-2025.11.X-test.msi <-- That's the version with zef hopefully being fixed and the paths with excessive ../../../../ cleaned up

[15:50] <japhb> Oh nice, thanks patrickb++!

[15:51] <patrickb> That other T::P is fixed as well. But without cloud flare there is no CI for us.

[15:55] <japhb> Didn't know CloudFlare was down ...

[15:55] <japhb> And once again, IRC is the thing that's still up when the rest of the world falls over.

[15:57] <japhb> Back when I was there, Google SRE had its own private IRC network as backup for "Things are so broken we can't even talk to each other right now."
