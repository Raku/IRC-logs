[02:23] <japhb> Wheeee ... README now with actual instructions on how to get Windows Terminal to understand UTF-8

[02:23] <japhb> Now I just need to update the MacOS screenshots ... any MacOS users in here?

[21:09] <patrickb> japhb: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo.org/pull/111 <- This hopefully helps a little with the missing Zef issue.

[21:35] <patrickb> japhb: https://github.com/ugexe/zef/pull/594 <- And a fix for the excessive updirs in the post install message.

[21:46] <patrickb> japhb: Do you have a good idea on how to best deal with the UTF-16 Windows terminals? We could try detecting whether we are on Windows AND are running in a terminal AND the codepage is not set to UTF-8 and then print a warning to STDERR.

[21:46] <patrickb> But I'm unsure if there is a legit use-case for Raku on non UTF-8 terminals that we might hamper in this way.

[23:19] <japhb> patrickb: comment on 111; looking at 594

[23:21] <japhb> patrickb: comment on 594

[23:23] <japhb> Where are you proposing to put that check?  In the installer, in the raku binary, in the Terminal::Print or Terminal::Widgets startup, ...?

[23:25] <japhb> If the programmer/user is doing all their work in ASCII, they should be fine with any of the Latin (and maybe European?) codepages.  The problem is that it's increasingly rare for real programs to studiously keep to ASCII ... and basically all of them expect UTF-8 encoding.

[23:27] <japhb> That said, I *am* curious what some of the "souped-up CLI" programs like npm and docker do when they find themselves on Windows and without a UTF-8 locale.

[23:28] <japhb> By "souped-up CLI" I mean the ones that don't switch into a full-screen TUI app, but *do* use ANSI/VT strings, non-ASCII symbols, and emoji.

[23:28] <japhb> *control strings
