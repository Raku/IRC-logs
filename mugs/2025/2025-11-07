[06:02] <japhb> patrickb: I'm working my way through your T::W PRs.  Can you explain what your intended difference between word-wrap and line-wrap for SpanWrapping is?

[08:22] <patrickb> line wrap breaks lines on display width. word wrap breaks lines on word boundaries fitting into the display width.

[08:24] <patrickb> examples/rich-text.raku is a nice demo to try the features out.

[20:08] <japhb> OK, will clone your repo and look (the PRs won't apply against mine anymore, so I'm going to have to work them up the old fashioned way)

[21:27] <patrickb> If it helps I can do a rebase. (Not in the next three days tho.)

[21:45] <japhb> No worries, I've got some things to think through anyway.

[22:01] <patrickb> Cool. I'll ping before I do something so we won't do duplicate work.
