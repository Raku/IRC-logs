[03:11] <wayland> japhb: No worries.  I feel the same about table-oriented programming.  I feel like it's going to take me a year to get to v1, whereas if I were working on it full-time, I could probably do it in 10 weeks.

[05:43] <japhb> Bitrot is so annoying

[05:48] <wayland> Does Terminal::Widgets do table-based output yet?  Because my Table-Oriented Programming has something that'll output a table using terminal box-drawing characters.   Not sure how helpful that is, but thought I'd mention it.  

[05:53] <japhb> wayland: I can't remember if my local widget for tabular output with lots of cells has been merged in (I think not, actually, dangit) ... but for a smaller number of cells, the widget-packing layout engine will do it automatically when you specify rows and columns.

[05:54] <japhb> It's just not as convenient if you want to actually wrangle a spreadsheet with 1000 cells.

[05:54] <japhb> But if you're just trying to get multi-column output, that's a freebie.  :-)

[06:45] <wayland> Hmm.  Interesting.  Maybe I should consider this as another "Formatter" for table-oriented programming.

[07:15] <Xliff> japhb: for hpad(), would you mind if I added a :$char = ' ' so that I can do something like '░'

[07:15] <Xliff> Well, since you've gone to bed, I'll make the quick change and send off a PR.

[07:31] <Geth> ¦ Terminal-QuickCharts: Xliff++ created pull request #2: - Adds option to add an empty char to hbar-chart(), hbar() and hpad()

[21:35] <Xliff> japhb: Looks like latest version of Terminal::Widgets isn't displaying right. As soon as I try any of the examples, the screen locks up and doesn't process keyboard events. Also, none of the widgets seem to display properly. 

[21:35] <Xliff> Can you check and see if examples/two-forms.raku works for you?

[22:19] <japhb> Well that's odd ...

[22:20] <japhb> OK, taking a look

[22:20] <japhb> WTH?

[22:22] <japhb> Are you running 0.1.5 or HEAD?

[22:22] <japhb> Xliff: ^^

[22:35] <japhb> I've confirmed the lockup, trying to bisect

[22:38] <wayland76> japhb: I was looking at the source on GitHub and didn't see anything obviously table-y.  

[22:39] <japhb> wayland76: Can you add an issue requesting that?  I'm about 3 levels deep in yak shaving and I don't want to forget that.

[22:41] <japhb> I can't find any difference in the lockup behavior at several spots between 0.1.5 and HEAD, which indicates to me that something changed in either a dependency or in Rakudo that is causing the problem.

[22:49] <wayland76> japhb: Done at https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-Widgets/issues/26

[22:57] <japhb> Thanks wayland76

[23:11] <japhb> Gah, can't tell what's working and what's not.  OK, rolling back my local repos a bit and completely rebuilding from scratch.

[23:49] <japhb> Looks like things still lock up with various Terminal-* repos rolled back.  Trying a Rakudo rollback.
