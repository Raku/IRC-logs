[07:11] <patrickb> re "Where are you proposing to put that check?  In the installer, in the raku binary, in Terminal::Print or Terminal::Widgets startup?" I originally thought about in the Raku binary. But it does seem to be a bad idea as we inject a print into a users output stream.

[07:15] <patrickb> Places we could put a check / note in: - The set-env.ps1 script in the ZIP release. - The welcome text of the REPL. - The README. - The website.
