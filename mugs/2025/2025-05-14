[09:30] <patrickb> japhb: Thanks for working on this again!

[09:31] <patrickb> #19 and #21 are two pretty small PRs, easy to review.

[09:32] <patrickb> #24 (and then #22) is the big PR. I guess those will take some time to review (and probably iterate on).

[14:35] <japhb> I am glad to be back on it.  :-)

[14:36] <japhb> OK, will look at those later today (mornings tend to be a little rushed here).
