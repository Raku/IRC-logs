[04:21] <japhb> Life is improving apace.  It is nice to actually be able to use the office in my new home, though we are still discovering interesting things about the house, so that's a bit of a thing.  Cool house though.

[04:22] <japhb> I'm finally able to assemble sufficient brain cells to consider actual engineering and design (as opposed to just rote coding).  This is a nice feeling.

[04:23] <japhb> And kid return to school is progressing, which clears some mental space as well.

[04:23] <japhb> How are things for y'all?

[10:25] <lizmat> when we're not asleep, pretty ok  :-)

[10:25] <lizmat> very well when we're asleep  :-)

[15:18] <japhb> lizmat: Now if I could just get rid of this pesky alarm thing that ruins my perfectly awesome sleep every day ....

[15:19] <japhb> patrickb: Yeah, small kids will definitely bring the sick, that's for sure.

[15:20] <japhb> patrickb: Are you enjoying the environment *because* the parents are in town, or are those separate things?

[15:21] <patrickb> It's a really nice town even when disregarding our parents, but they do their fair share. :-)

[15:23] <japhb> patrickb: Ah!  That's even better.  :-)

[15:25] <patrickb> With the Cro release out of the way, I can now finally continue with my get-Rakudo-working-on-Windows endeavour. - Yay!
