[19:03] <patrickb> https://github.com/ab5tract/Terminal-Print/pull/88 # Reapply switch to Terminal-API

[19:23] <japhb> Looks like it failed on Windows? https://github.com/ab5tract/Terminal-Print/actions/runs/14522904479/job/40747807165?pr=88

[19:37] <patrickb> I'm already looking into that. I suspect it's tripping over output redirection.

[19:42] <japhb> Ah, OK

[19:49] <patrickb> Should I be correct, what would be a good way out? If the output handle is unusable, return some default size? (e.g. 80x24)

[19:49] <patrickb> Yeah, my suspicion was right...

[19:56] <japhb> How did you end up with an unusable output handle?

[19:57] <japhb> But also yes, final fall back to 80x24 is probably useful.  My only worry is that it might hide real bugs.

[20:06] <patrickb> It fails when running the tests using prove6 and succeeds when running them directly with Raku.

[20:08] <japhb> ???  That's ... odd.

[20:09] <japhb> What about old-school Perl prove?

[20:14] <patrickb> I can try. But I've run out of keyboard time for today...

[20:14] <patrickb> Does the CI use prove?

[20:25] <japhb> No, but I'm curious if we've got a prove6 problem on Windows; using Perl 5 prove would rule that out.

[20:25] <japhb> Good luck with your non-keyboard time!

[20:28] <patrickb> Thanks!

[23:05] <timo> when trying to use Terminal::LineEditor in the context of something with more parts, I find myself wanting a prompt or read-input that don't enter and leave raw mode by themselves

[23:14] <japhb> timo: That's one of the changes I made in Terminal::Widgets, because I had the same thoughts.  :-)

[23:15] <timo> i just mixed in a role where enter and leave raw mode will first check $*ACTUALLY-DO-IT :D
