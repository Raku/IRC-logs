[00:23] <japhb> OK, that's support for recursive detection for the "real" terminal underneath screen, tmux, and Zellij, and masking of broken capabilities for each.

[00:23] <japhb> Anyone know any other terminal multiplexers that should be supported?

[00:24] <japhb> Also: if anyone uses mosh (MObile SHell, a remote connection maintainer), let me know and I can work with you to get that supported as well.

[15:32] <patrickb> Random question: In what way is the terminal underlying a multiplexer relevant for a terminal app? Shouldn't the multiplexer effectively isolate the terminal app entirely from the surrounding terminal?

[15:34] <patrickb> Also: What if I'm using tmux in a multi seat session? (Two users with different terminals connect to the same tmux session.) Then there are two different underlying terminals at the same time.

[15:42] <japhb> The underlying terminal determines capabilities (does it support box drawing, does it support 24-bit color, etc.)

[15:43] <japhb> Multiplexers have to interpret all of the escape sequences in both directions and carry a concept of the state of a virtual terminal for each pane, plus the "actual" terminal underneath.

[15:43] <japhb> But each of the multiplexers has sequences it doesn't handle, or handles badly.

[15:44] <japhb> So basically the true capabilities as seen by an app are the intersection of the capabilities of the underlying terminal and the multiplexer on top of it.

[15:45] <japhb> This autodetection is based on the environment variables of the app process, which means that in the multi-head case, the terminal that started the app "wins" the autodetection.

[15:46] <japhb> It is possible to do some of the autodetection via query sequences, but I really have no idea what multiplexers do when you query for something they don't natively understand but that *one* of the terminals in a multi-head setup does understand.

[15:46] <japhb> My guess is "drop it on the floor"

[17:41] <patrickb> Thanks for the explanation!
